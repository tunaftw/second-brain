  "summary": "Bill Gurley discusses his book 'Running Down a Dream' with Tim Ferriss, exploring why people should pursue their passions rather than pragmatic careers. Using Matthew McConaughey's story of switching from law to film school, Gurley argues that true success comes from obsessive self-learning in areas you're genuinely passionate about.",

      "full": "Bill Gurley recounts a pivotal story from Matthew McConaughey's book Green Lights. McConaughey had spent years telling his family he would become a lawyer, but friends at UT convinced him to switch to film school. Terrified to tell his tough father, he finally breaks the news. His father's response: 'Don't half-ass it.' McConaughey says these were the last words he expected and the best he could have heard—giving him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility. Gurley calls this 'rocket fuel' and hopes his book can provide similar permission to others stuck on paths they don't love.",
