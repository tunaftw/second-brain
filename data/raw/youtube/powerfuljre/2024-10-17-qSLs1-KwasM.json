  "transcript": "[00:01] Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe\n[00:04] Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan\n[00:07] podcast by night all\n[00:12] day good to see you sir what's happening\n[00:14] good to see you too Joe I watched uh\n[00:17] episode one and I'm into episode two of\n[00:19] your new season uh looks fantastic looks\n[00:21] awesome fantastic information but before\n[00:24] we do anything I think we should\n[00:26] probably address what we know now about\n[00:28] the debate that you had with Flint dible\n[00:31] so that was the last time we were here\n[00:33] um it was I I appreciate that he came on\n[00:36] and I thought it was going to be an\n[00:37] interesting discussion\n[00:39] but it turned out he played fast and\n[00:41] loose with the truth um and and\n[00:44] distorted quite a bit of information\n[00:47] that um were some key points that you\n[00:50] had discussed one of them being uh the\n[00:52] amount of shipwrecks that were\n[00:54] discovered he greatly inflated the\n[00:56] amount of shipwrecks that have been\n[00:57] discovered and then you released a video\n[01:00] uh today yeah um that went over a lot of\n[01:03] this stuff and one of the things it went\n[01:04] over is the oldest shipwreck that we are\n[01:07] currently available it's about 4,000\n[01:09] years old about 6,000 6,000 the docos\n[01:11] ship right but there's nothing left of\n[01:13] the ship no and this is what's important\n[01:15] that you know what he was trying to say\n[01:18] was that it would be preserved yeah by\n[01:20] the cold water that turns out to not be\n[01:21] the truth at all and that these ships\n[01:24] that are 6,000 years old there's nothing\n[01:26] left of the actual boat itself the only\n[01:28] thing that's left is pottery and coins\n[01:31] and things of the like and especially\n[01:33] when you consider the possibility of\n[01:35] ships having gone through a cataclysm\n[01:37] not but there's a there's a more Central\n[01:40] Point than that which which really\n[01:42] needed to be brought up by the\n[01:45] archaeologist in this which is that\n[01:48] which is that archaeology universally\n[01:50] accepts that human beings were seaf\n[01:52] farers as much as 50,000 years ago and I\n[01:56] I put the evidence on this into the into\n[01:58] the video it's not even in dispute like\n[01:59] the island of\n[02:01] Cyprus the nearest Turkish Coast is\n[02:03] about 60 km from there uh it's always\n[02:07] been surrounded by huge deeps it's\n[02:09] always been an island even at the peak\n[02:11] of the sea sea level lowest sea level\n[02:14] during the Ice Age Cypress was always an\n[02:16] island and yet there's evidence now that\n[02:19] it was settled 14,000 years ago\n[02:23] certainly 14,000 to 12,500 years ago it\n[02:26] was settled in other words during the\n[02:28] Ice Age and and these were large planned\n[02:31] migrations when you're going to migrate\n[02:34] to an island you can't just go two or\n[02:36] three people by accident because you\n[02:37] become extinct you have to bring in\n[02:40] quite a large population and they\n[02:41] reckoned that populations of a thousand\n[02:43] or so were being brought across that\n[02:45] water across the ocean across the\n[02:47] Mediterranean Sea to Cyprus near the end\n[02:49] of the last ice age but not a single\n[02:51] ship has survived from to to to testify\n[02:54] to that same with Australia 50,000 years\n[02:57] ago human beings got there and even at\n[02:59] at the lowest sea level they would have\n[03:02] had to cross about 90 km of Open Water\n[03:05] uh and in large numbers and again no\n[03:07] ships have been found to testify to that\n[03:09] yet archaeologists accept that they got\n[03:11] there by ship so so to say that we\n[03:13] haven't found any ships uh from from the\n[03:16] Ice Age is not really evidence about\n[03:18] anything and if we're finding the oldest\n[03:20] ships that we we currently are aware of\n[03:22] which is as you said about 6,000 years\n[03:24] ago if you tack on another 6,000 years\n[03:28] of Decay on top of that what are the\n[03:30] odds you're going to find anything I\n[03:32] think the odds are very very low now if\n[03:34] we had that evidence and that\n[03:36] information when we were confronting\n[03:37] Flint that would have been a very\n[03:38] different conversation totally but the\n[03:41] the arrogance in which he distributed\n[03:43] that fake information was uh it's\n[03:46] disturbing it sucks when people just\n[03:48] want to win yeah and they don't want to\n[03:50] get to the truth it does and the truth\n[03:53] is kind it's very fascinating another\n[03:55] thing that was very fascinating that he\n[03:57] discussed uh I didn't watch your whole\n[03:58] video but it was about seeds um I asked\n[04:02] the question there's there's a very\n[04:05] distinct um noticeable difference\n[04:07] between domestic seeds and seeds that\n[04:10] are wild and the difference is the seeds\n[04:11] that are wild they break off easier\n[04:13] because it it makes sense that it would\n[04:17] uh help them Prosper it would help them\n[04:21] be able to spread the seed if it broke\n[04:23] off the plant easier and so they can\n[04:25] recognize that and then when they start\n[04:28] using large scale agriculture the seeds\n[04:31] become more robust and stick to the to\n[04:34] the plant because it makes sense that it\n[04:35] would if you're going to harvest all the\n[04:38] plants and then take the seeds off of\n[04:39] that for the the plant to prosper you\n[04:43] would want the the seeds to be more\n[04:45] robust so there's these changes and I\n[04:47] said have they ever noticed a a\n[04:50] domesticated seed going back and having\n[04:53] the characteristics of a wild seed he\n[04:54] said no yeah but that's not true either\n[04:56] that's not true either no it's not it's\n[04:59] it's not true and and the whole notion\n[05:01] of the of the origins of Agriculture I\n[05:03] think archaeologist got a great deal\n[05:05] more work to do on that often I'm\n[05:10] misrepresented as saying that survivors\n[05:12] of my supposed Lost\n[05:14] Civilization um would have would have\n[05:17] brought crops with them I I think that's\n[05:19] most unlikely in a cataclysmic situation\n[05:21] what they brought with them was the\n[05:22] knowledge that crops can be domesticated\n[05:25] and it's precisely during the younger\n[05:27] dras that we see that shift from\n[05:29] undomestic at to domesticated crops in\n[05:31] the archaeological record and what I'm\n[05:33] suggesting is that these were people who\n[05:35] had already conquered that problem\n[05:38] they'd already solved that problem they\n[05:39] knew it could be done uh and they\n[05:41] brought that knowledge with them and\n[05:43] shared that shared that knowledge with\n[05:45] the people that they took Refuge a\n[05:47] months because I don't think we're\n[05:48] looking at a a mass migration I think\n[05:50] we're looking at a few survivors who are\n[05:52] taking Refuge after a global\n[05:55] cataclysm you know it's just very\n[05:57] unfortunate when you have a debate and\n[05:59] and uh one person is an expert and\n[06:01] they're not they're not truthful and\n[06:03] it's it just I think it's very bad I\n[06:05] think it's very bad for archaeology it\n[06:07] is because it reinforces all the things\n[06:08] that you've been saying it it it does uh\n[06:11] I mean to be honest I felt beaten up\n[06:12] after that after that debate but looking\n[06:16] back in in in retrospect on on on the\n[06:19] whole thing I think it actually it\n[06:20] actually makes the point that we have a\n[06:22] very arrogant very controlling\n[06:25] discipline in archaeology which has\n[06:28] established a narrative about the which\n[06:30] will fight tooth and nail to maintain\n[06:32] that narrative including using dirty\n[06:35] tricks and I I think instead of you know\n[06:37] smearing people who talk about the\n[06:39] possibility of A Lost Civilization or\n[06:41] people who even talk about aliens I\n[06:43] think of in instead of smearing them\n[06:44] archaeology should understand why people\n[06:46] are asking those questions people are\n[06:48] asking those questions because they're\n[06:49] not satisfied with what Archaeology is\n[06:51] offering it's not it's not providing a\n[06:53] nurturing satisfying resolution to many\n[06:56] of the problems that that that come from\n[06:59] the past and that's what drives me is is\n[07:02] is curiosity about anomalies in the past\n[07:05] I'm often misrepresented as saying that\n[07:07] somehow I've proved that A Lost\n[07:10] Civilization existed and and I don't\n[07:12] claim to have proved that what I do say\n[07:14] is join me on this journey there are\n[07:16] mysteries in the past let's see if\n[07:18] they're explained by archaeology or if\n[07:20] they're not explained and I found quite\n[07:21] a number that are not explained by\n[07:23] archaeology and that's particularly to\n[07:25] do with uh astronomical alignments with\n[07:28] Traditions that are shared all around\n[07:30] the world it's to do with it's to do\n[07:32] with things that archaeologist by and\n[07:34] large don't study this episode of The\n[07:37] Joe Rogan Experience is brought to you\n[07:39] by Call of Duty you know when a new Call\n[07:41] of Duty drops everyone's trying to find\n[07:44] a way to squeeze in those extra hours of\n[07:47] gameplay I get it life is busy but\n[07:50] sometimes you just\n[07:52]

jump\n[08:41] in head over to call of duty.com\n[08:44] Black Ops 6 to get in the game Call of\n[08:49] Duty Black Ops 6 pre-order now well it's\n[08:53] also one of the things that's\n[08:55] fascinating is just even with\n[08:57] conventional archaeology the dates to\n[08:58] keep getting p pushed further and\n[09:00] further back further and further back\n[09:01] and this is the one of the things the\n[09:03] White Sands New Mexico stuff that you\n[09:05] have on episode one that's right which\n[09:07] is by the way White Sands have you been\n[09:09] there no I haven't what an incredible\n[09:12] amazing ethereal otherworldly place and\n[09:14] Alam mordo is sitting right in the\n[09:16] middle of that this is where they did\n[09:17] the nuclear tests and the trinitite you\n[09:22] which was which was created there and\n[09:23] there's gypsum sand it's not normal it's\n[09:25] just the most amazing amazing place and\n[09:27] there yes they found human footprints\n[09:29] dated back more than 20 23,000 years\n[09:32] what do they think that environment was\n[09:34] like 22,000 years ago well it would\n[09:37] still have been like that it would have\n[09:38] been gypsum Junes then in that in in\n[09:40] that place otherwise Dunes they wouldn't\n[09:42] have left the footprints I'm not exactly\n[09:44] sure why the gypsum is there but there\n[09:45] is is that the same stuff they use for\n[09:47] like gyps and board for construction I\n[09:48] reckon so yeah wow yeah wow it's a very\n[09:51] fine very white sand and and it just\n[09:55] goes on forever and the Junes are\n[09:56] sculpted and massive and huge and with\n[09:59] amazing time there so it looked\n[10:01] incredible so they found Footprints\n[10:02] there and these are absolutely human\n[10:04] Footprints and there's not just a few of\n[10:06] them there's thousands of them there's\n[10:07] thousands of them and what's what's\n[10:08] amazing when you when you actually see\n[10:11] the footprints is you can see the\n[10:12] interactions between the human beings\n[10:15] and and animals you can see that you can\n[10:17] see that somebody is reacting to a giant\n[10:19] sloth which has suddenly turned around\n[10:21] and the person who's behind it suddenly\n[10:23] turns around as well there's there's\n[10:26] Mammoth Footprints overlaying human\n[10:28] Footprints and then human Footprints\n[10:29] overlaying those uh and it goes down for\n[10:32] meters under the ground so you have the\n[10:34] you have a very deep stratification of\n[10:38] these Impressions that have been left\n[10:40] behind by our ancestors uh and and by\n[10:43] animals that are now completely extinct\n[10:45] mammoths and mastadons went went extinct\n[10:47] during the younger ders but there are\n[10:49] their Footprints from 23,000 years ago\n[10:51] side by side with the footprints of\n[10:53] human beings it's it's very intimate to\n[10:55] see to see a footprint to see those\n[10:57] those five toes to see the heel to see\n[11:00] sometimes a child walking beside a\n[11:02] mother that's that's there in the in the\n[11:04] record as well it's quite it's quite\n[11:06] something special and it it opens the\n[11:09] door archaeology has been very reluctant\n[11:11] to accept uh a much older peopling of\n[11:13] the Americas than previously was held it\n[11:15] was held for a long time that it was\n[11:17] about 13,000 years ago they've abandoned\n[11:19] that now they did cling on tooth and\n[11:22] nail for decades but that's been\n[11:24] abandoned it's accepted that human\n[11:26] beings came here long before 13,000\n[11:29] years years ago and White Sands is one\n[11:31] of the places which which provides just\n[11:33] absolute definite irrefutable evidence\n[11:35] of that that they were here 23,000 years\n[11:37] ago but we don't know yet how long\n[11:39] before that they were here this is this\n[11:42] is this is part of the problem I often\n[11:45] remember a site called the serti\n[11:47] masteron site in San\n[11:50] Diego um I went to see it's the exhibits\n[11:53] are in the San Diego Natural History\n[11:55] Museum and I talked with the expert\n[11:56] there Dr Tom Demay uh and they are\n[11:59] convinced that they are looking at human\n[12:02] traces there it was a butcher butchering\n[12:04] of a Mastadon but the way the bones were\n[12:06] broken and the marrow was extracted they\n[12:08] don't see any other way that this could\n[12:09] have been done except by human beings\n[12:11] the thing is it's 130,000 years old not\n[12:14] 23,000 years old not 13,000 years old\n[12:17] but 130,000 years old and you know this\n[12:21] opens the possibility that human beings\n[12:23] have been in the Americas before they\n[12:25] were in Europe uh and that becomes uh\n[12:28] that's crazy that's a door that opens\n[12:30] all kinds of possibilities which have\n[12:32] been neglected I think the the\n[12:34] prejudices the Prejudice that the\n[12:36] Americas were only settled very late in\n[12:38] the human story uh LED archaeology to\n[12:41] not have their eye on the possibility of\n[12:43] what happens if they were here earlier\n[12:45] right and they tend not to and they tend\n[12:47] not to look to that well what I was\n[12:48] going to ask is as they're digging\n[12:50] deeper and deeper and they're finding\n[12:51] these Footprints in Whit s New Mexico is\n[12:54] there a possibility that they could dig\n[12:55] deeper still and find things that are\n[12:57] even older yes absolutely how are they\n[13:00] how do they know where to go it was\n[13:02] found by accident um the the first\n[13:04] Footprints were were were found\n[13:07] completely by by accident and and they\n[13:10] were found by indigenous local people uh\n[13:13] who alerted the the National Park\n[13:14] Service to to them um and and we have uh\n[13:18] a number of indigenous spokespeople who\n[13:21] who speak to the to the white sounds\n[13:23] mystery and how it how it feels for them\n[13:25] the emotional feeling of seeing the\n[13:27] footprints of their ancestors 3,000\n[13:30] years ago the thing is that the dunes\n[13:31] are constantly shifting and sometimes\n[13:33] the footprints will be covered up and\n[13:35] then wind will reveal them again and\n[13:37] they're fragile they can be easily\n[13:38] destroyed and wiped off and in a way\n[13:40] it's a miracle that they've that they've\n[13:42] survived but to see the stride of a\n[13:44] mammoth you see the how far apart those\n[13:47] huge foot pths are uh and and to realize\n[13:51] this thing was alive this thing existed\n[13:53] on this planet human beings interacted\n[13:55] with it it's a very compelling evidence\n[13:57] for an earlier s Amer there is some\n[14:00] evidence that human beings came across\n[14:03] the bearing land bridge oh yeah so that\n[14:06] probably means there was people already\n[14:08] here and people came here from Asia\n[14:11] almost certainly and and the way the\n[14:13] evidence is looking uh it's most likely\n[14:16] that South America was settled first uh\n[14:18] before North America was settled and\n[14:20] that raises all kinds of questions and\n[14:21] we've gone into this in season 2 of\n[14:23] ancient apocalypse uh primarily to do\n[14:26] with um the DNA evidence of a direct\n[14:29] connection between the peoples of New\n[14:32] Guinea and Australia and the peoples of\n[14:34] certain tribes in South America and\n[14:36] that's very ancient very old DNA\n[14:38] evidence in South America but also to do\n[14:40] with archaeological sites like Monte\n[14:42] Verde I did bring up the issue of Tom\n[14:44] Dill the last time we were we were on\n[14:46] when Flint was here and Tom Dill who\n[14:50] found Monte Verde who excavated Monte\n[14:52] Verde in in South America and realized\n[14:54] that it was uh plus 14,000 years old and\n[14:57] therefore a lot older than what was then\n[15:00] accepted as the model for the first\n[15:02] peoples in North America uh when he put\n[15:04] that idea forward he was he was\n[15:06] eviscerated by his colleagues in in\n[15:08] archaeology it took them a decade to\n[15:10] come round to accepting that actually he\n[15:12] was right and there are many other SS in\n[15:14] South America uh going back 30 plus\n[15:17] thousand years they're all controversial\n[15:19] because they conflict with an existing\n[15:20] model but I think instead of clinging on\n[15:23] to existing models I think it's one of\n[15:25] the problems with archaeology uh is this\n[15:27] territoriality this kind of control of\n[15:30] the past I I think instead of doing that\n[15:32] it would be it would be nicer if\n[15:33] archaeology was a little bit more\n[15:34] welcoming a little bit more open to to\n[15:37] new and different ideas unfortunately\n[15:39] that's just the thing when people are\n[15:40] supposed experts in a subject and\n[15:42] someone comes along that's also been\n[15:44] studying it but from an untraditional\n[15:46] perspective yeah people reject that I've\n[15:48] come I've come to the point and I'm\n[15:50] going to say something some strong words\n[15:52] here I I get crazy get\n[15:54] crazy I've I've come to the point where\n[15:57] I I believe that some olist not all of\n[15:59] them most actually this this problem is\n[16:02] with a small number of archaeologist but\n[16:04] they're extremely vocal um I think what\n[16:07] we're looking at is a kind of abuse of\n[16:09] power uh archaeology archaeologists have\n[16:12] a power they are the official\n[16:14] spokespeople for the for the past and\n[16:17] they use that power to slap down any\n[16:20] point of view that doesn't agree with\n[16:22] theirs so I think that there's there's\n[16:24] an abuse of power there and at the same\n[16:26] time uh there's not a realiz ation that\n[16:29] that's happening because the mindset\n[16:31] that drives it is the feeling that\n[16:33] members of the general public are unable\n[16:36] to decide things for themselves this is\n[16:38] the arrogance of archaeology that they\n[16:40] feel that they have to tell people what\n[16:42] to think about the past and they\n[16:43] underestimate the intelligence of the\n[16:45] public and and the ability of the public\n[16:47] to discern to make choices between\n[16:49] different possibilities about the past\n[16:50] they think that archaist seem to think\n[16:52] that only one possibility of the past\n[16:54] must be considered uh by the general\n[16:56] public and that's their possibility it\n[16:59] reminds me a lot of the heresy Hunters\n[17:01] back in the 16th century you know the\n[17:03] the people who disagreed with their\n[17:04] point of view got burned at the stake\n[17:07] well you don't get burned at the stake\n[17:08] today but you can get lynched by a mob\n[17:11] of archaeologists well it's also the\n[17:13] same thing that we saw during Co with\n[17:15] medical experts it disagreed with the\n[17:17] narrative it's the same thing it is\n[17:18] absolutely the same thing when you take\n[17:20] esteemed professors and doctors and\n[17:22] Physicians and you you cast them into\n[17:25] this cook label because they disagree\n[17:28] with the narrative that the medical\n[17:29] establishment is pushing and then they\n[17:31] turn out to be correct which most of\n[17:33] them did MH you see the same patterns\n[17:35] it's just power it's just power and\n[17:37] people that take have their identity\n[17:40] wrapped up in them being the ones that\n[17:42] have access to the actual information\n[17:44] yeah they don't want it to be\n[17:46] distributed by some guy on Netflix\n[17:48] that's right it's it's even though\n[17:51] you've been probably studying it more\n[17:52] than them certainly studying particular\n[17:55] aspects of that's the other thing I\n[17:56] noticed which was the sneering\n[17:59] attitude to to towards me they talk\n[18:01] about my you know my wife s taking\n[18:04] tourist photos of the places that we've\n[18:05] been to well we've never been anywhere\n[18:07] as tourists we haven't had a holiday for\n[18:08] 20 years but but the working trips that\n[18:11] we do are very intense your wife's an\n[18:14] amazing for dopher like who cares if she\n[18:16] takes tourist photos the photos are\n[18:17] incredible they're of real sites that\n[18:19] are very pertinent and very interesting\n[18:21] that's right the whole criticizing\n[18:24] amazing photographs is one of the\n[18:25] dumbest things I've ever heard like why\n[18:27] would you criticize amazing photo\n[18:28] photogaphs of ruins that are perplexing\n[18:30] yeah I know how could you how could you\n[18:33] find an even an area where you want\n[18:36] people to agree with you it's part of\n[18:37] this desperate search to say we\n[18:39] archaeologists know everything uh and\n[18:41] and we must discredit uh in any way we\n[18:44] can anybody who has anything opposite to\n[18:47] say it's an unfortunate human\n[18:48] characteristic that it it happens in\n[18:51] everything you see it in martial arts\n[18:52] you see it in science you see it in\n[18:54] everything this Reliance on Experts I\n[18:57] get it I would like the pilot of my\n[18:59] plane to be an expert\n[19:02] pilot I don't want him to be an amateur\n[19:05] yeah but I don't think that\n[19:06] archaeologists and aircraft Pilots are\n[19:09] can be compared in that sense\n[19:11] Archaeology is a much more interpretive\n[19:13] discipline an aircraft pilot is not\n[19:14] really interpreting situations that much\n[19:16] he knows what to do in such situations\n[19:18] archaeologists are interpreting the past\n[19:20] and yet they seem to get very upset by\n[19:23] other interpretations of the past that\n[19:25] are offered that don't that don't agree\n[19:27] with theirs and this is this is the\n[19:28] problem problem of expertise in our\n[19:29] society yes expertise is very important\n[19:32] it's incredibly useful but we should not\n[19:35] place all our faith and trust in experts\n[19:39] we need to liberate our own\n[19:40] Consciousness and freely think about\n[19:42] things and make our own decisions about\n[19:44] things and resist resist absolutely\n[19:47] being told what to think well the\n[19:49] problem is these experts are human\n[19:51] beings and human beings have very\n[19:54] distinct Behavior traits yeah that they\n[19:56] exhibit especially when they're in a\n[19:58] position of power and Prestige yeah and\n[20:00] they like to hold that and they like to\n[20:02] it feels good for them to be the person\n[20:03] that looks down upon the people that\n[20:05] don't know better and tell them what to\n[20:07] do and tell them what to think and when\n[20:09] you're doing that with something like AR\n[20:10] look if you're doing that with something\n[20:12] like mathematics and someone's a\n[20:13] mathematical expert math is a very\n[20:16] specific and precise science yeah it's\n[20:19] very specific yeah Archaeology is like\n[20:21] who [ __ ] knows what's out there\n[20:24] because you haven't searched everything\n[20:26] it's not possible to and as we devel\n[20:29] more these these fascinating\n[20:31] Technologies like lar where you have the\n[20:34] ability ground penetrating radar all\n[20:36] these different things where you can\n[20:37] look into the soil itself and find\n[20:40] things that aren't visible on the\n[20:41] surface see them through trees see them\n[20:43] through that we're going to find more\n[20:45] and and obviously in Brazil they have\n[20:47] done in the Amazon they have done that\n[20:49] well that was part of our adventure with\n[20:50] with season 2 of ancient apocalypse was\n[20:52] the was was working with with a really\n[20:55] professional team in in Brazil uh led by\n[20:58] a an archaeologist Marty paronan from\n[21:00] the University of Helsinki and a\n[21:02] geographer from Brazil alo ranzi alo\n[21:06] years ago was the first person who\n[21:08] noticed that there are these huge\n[21:10] geometrical structures emerging out of\n[21:12] the Amazon jungle and and he he noticed\n[21:14] it on a on a flight on a commercial on a\n[21:17] commercial aircraft in an area that\n[21:19] happened to have been cleared by local\n[21:20] farmers for planting crops uh that there\n[21:23] was this massive geometrical earthwork\n[21:26] there and that he he actually coined the\n[21:29] term geoglyphs for these because he\n[21:31] compared them in some ways with the\n[21:32] NASCAR lines which again are really only\n[21:35] visible from the air you get the\n[21:36] suddenly the the massive scope and\n[21:39] extent of these things and it's same\n[21:41] with the geoglyphs in the in the Amazon\n[21:44] and and here's the thing the ones we\n[21:46] know about up till now have we largely\n[21:50] know about them because of these tragic\n[21:52] clearances of the Amazon rainforest\n[21:54] which is a maybe short-term economic\n[21:57] game but is a long-term not a very good\n[21:59] idea um but now with liar it's possible\n[22:03] to find these things without damaging\n[22:05] any rainforest at all and we had a liar\n[22:08] expert with us and and you can fly liar\n[22:11] off a drone now that's amazing yeah it's\n[22:13] it's incredible it's a pretty hefty\n[22:14] drone but but they can fly anywhere and\n[22:18] and we found I say we it was actually\n[22:21] the liar expert who found he found with\n[22:23] the you can see the edge of the\n[22:25] rainforest where where the clearances\n[22:27] stop and the rainforest hasn't yet been\n[22:29] interfered with and then he flies over\n[22:31] there and within a matter of hours he's\n[22:33] found multiple more of these of these\n[22:35] structures s Deep In The rainfor Deep In\n[22:38] The Rain covered completely and lar\n[22:40] allows him to see through the canopy and\n[22:43] to see what's underneath it without\n[22:44] damaging it and there are these huge\n[22:46] Earthworks and this raises the question\n[22:48] how much more is there in the Amazon to\n[22:51] find especially which even even the\n[22:54] archaeologists who are most reluctant\n[22:55] are now willing to accept that the\n[22:57] Amazon had a huge popul\n[22:59] before the Spanish Conquest so wild\n[23:01] that's such a shift Millions cities yeah\n[23:05] a whole different way of life a whole\n[23:06] different kind of civilization from the\n[23:08] one that we have today one that lived in\n[23:10] a a man-made Garden which is what the\n[23:12] Amazon really and truly is and lived in\n[23:15] and lived in harmony with that that's an\n[23:17] interesting thing too we've talked about\n[23:19] that before for people have never heard\n[23:21] those other podcasts they've determined\n[23:23] that the the Amazon rainforest is at\n[23:25] least partially man-made definitely uh\n[23:28] they've they've determined that because\n[23:30] of the the preponderance of trees that\n[23:32] serve human needs uh they call them\n[23:35] hyperdominance and things like brazilnut\n[23:37] trees which are which which are\n[23:39] providing food for human beings are in\n[23:41] massive dominance in relation to trees\n[23:43] that aren't useful to human beings uh\n[23:45] and it's it's clear that this is a\n[23:46] result of a long-term human project to\n[23:49] make this jungle serve human needs what\n[23:52] was the other one the ice cream Bean\n[23:53] what was that ice cream bean\n[23:55] and I'm forgetting all of the details\n[23:57] but there's a there's a bunch of there's\n[23:59] aants of food plants which are which\n[24:01] which are hyperd dominant in the in in\n[24:03] the Amazon rainforest and these and\n[24:05] these food plants show that human beings\n[24:08] have been nurturing have been massaging\n[24:11] this natural wonder and turning it into\n[24:13] something that really serves human needs\n[24:15] and there's the other thing that you've\n[24:16] discussed in in depth the Terra praa\n[24:19] this this man-made incredibly Rich\n[24:22] nutrient dense soil that they can grow\n[24:25] incredible agriculture off of that we\n[24:27] really to this don't know how they\n[24:29] created it's a mystery again it was a\n[24:31] great privilege to have the opportunity\n[24:32] to stand in a pit of terraa that is\n[24:36] being excavated to get down 15 ft into\n[24:38] that with can they recreate it once they\n[24:41] get it um it appears that modern but not\n[24:44] modern but but indigenous communities in\n[24:48] the Amazon are still doing this they're\n[24:50] still they're still doing it mixing\n[24:51] mixing all kind of refu and waste uh\n[24:54] together and enriching the soil with it\n[24:56] so it's it's it's not stopped terpret is\n[24:59] still being made but most of it is very\n[25:00] old and the oldest that they found so\n[25:03] far is about 8,000 years old so it's\n[25:05] just large scale regenerative\n[25:07] agriculture using some old lost method\n[25:10] yeah that's right that's right and and\n[25:12] making see a rainforest even when you\n[25:15] choose trees that are going to serve\n[25:17] human needs it's not enough you do need\n[25:20] to be able to plant in the rainforest\n[25:22] and and that is what teraa has allowed\n[25:25] people to do rainforest soils are not\n[25:27] particularly fertile by Nature so it's\n[25:29] these spots of fertility all over the\n[25:31] Amazon and we we went into that mystery\n[25:33] quite quite a bit in in one of the\n[25:35] episodes It's so interesting especially\n[25:37] when you consider the stories like the\n[25:38] lost city of Z you know which they\n[25:41] turned into uh an interesting film but\n[25:43] the the book details these records of\n[25:47] these incredible cities that these\n[25:48] people had visited a long time ago and\n[25:50] then when they tried to go back there\n[25:51] was nothing there yeah because everybody\n[25:53] had died off because of European\n[25:55] diseases probably that's exactly what\n[25:56] happened yeah but those cities were just\n[25:59] consumed by the jungle yeah yeah and\n[26:02] much like Detroit if you go to Detroit\n[26:04] now you could see there's a like there's\n[26:06] a bunch of uh neighborhoods in Detroit\n[26:08] that are essentially abandoned and trees\n[26:09] are growing right through the houses and\n[26:12] the houses are I mean that's just a few\n[26:14] decades ago and the houses are almost\n[26:16] gone in some in some ways and if you\n[26:18] went back 200 years ago there' probably\n[26:19] be nothing left of them MH and this is\n[26:22] probably exactly what happened in the\n[26:24] Amazon except the trees just consume the\n[26:27] landscape cuz it's such a incredible\n[26:29] dense rainforest that things grow so\n[26:31] quickly there that's what happened I I\n[26:33] mean before the lost city of Z we have\n[26:35] this very interesting report and I have\n[26:37] mentioned it to you before in pre\n[26:39] previous episode the expedition of of um\n[26:43] gasp kahal and and his Chronicle\n[26:45] Francisco D Oriana um which was an\n[26:49] accidental Expedition they were just\n[26:51] going hunting in a Longboat but the\n[26:53] Amazon took them and wouldn't let them\n[26:56] go back and they traveled forth 4,000\n[26:58] miles across South America and ended up\n[27:00] in the they started on the Pacific side\n[27:02] and ended up in the Atlantic Ocean wow\n[27:05] and that's in the\n[27:06] 1550s 1560s and they report seeing\n[27:11] enormous thriving prosperous cities\n[27:13] highly civilized with Advanced arts and\n[27:15] crafts um and they were not believed\n[27:18] because 100 years later when other\n[27:21] Spaniards made that voyage and went into\n[27:24] the AMS and they couldn't find the\n[27:25] cities and the reason they couldn't find\n[27:26] them is precisely the reason that you\n[27:27] give which is that the jungle had eaten\n[27:30] those cities because the human\n[27:32] population had been wiped out by disease\n[27:34] brought by the Spaniard the spani didn't\n[27:36] have to have direct contact with those\n[27:38] indigenous peoples in the middle of the\n[27:39] Amazon the diseases just jumped from\n[27:41] population to population and just killed\n[27:43] everybody it's so wild that that happens\n[27:46] it's so crazy when most people probably\n[27:48] aren't even aware there everyone knows\n[27:51] there was a genocide of Native Americans\n[27:52] in this country but most people don't\n[27:54] know that 90% of them were wiped out by\n[27:56] disease absolutely which is just\n[27:58] unbelievable to think about millions of\n[28:00] people just wiped out over the course of\n[28:02] a few decades or or hundred years by\n[28:05] diseases yeah it's a early example of a\n[28:07] biological weapon yeah um right and to\n[28:10] some extent uh it was used deliberately\n[28:13] as a biological weapon like like those\n[28:15] small poox infected blankets is that\n[28:17] true the small poox infected blankets\n[28:19] I've heard that that was like a a rumor\n[28:22] may it may well be a rumor but from what\n[28:24] I've looked at from from the Spanish\n[28:26] conquest of Mexico uh there was there\n[28:28] was a realization that we can kill these\n[28:30] people with small pox and and uh and it\n[28:34] was and it was spread and and we have\n[28:36] some immunity to it that they that they\n[28:38] don't have right because we had it\n[28:40] forever in Europe yeah it's it's just so\n[28:42] um terrible when you read cabesa daka's\n[28:45] uh story about visiting the Maya\n[28:47] civilization and you realize like that\n[28:49] was you guys [ __ ] killed everybody\n[28:52] yeah the disease the diseases did I I\n[28:55] mean the battles did Kill Some people\n[28:57] but but not on the order of the diseases\n[29:00] Mex Mexico City fell to the\n[29:02] Spaniards\n[29:04] um primarily because of disease uh and\n[29:08] secondarily because the Aztecs weren't\n[29:10] popular with their neighbors so it\n[29:12] really wasn't just CZ and 400 Spaniards\n[29:15] it was it was Cortez and 400 Spaniards\n[29:18] plus small pox plus the tasins who the\n[29:22] Aztecs had used as a sort of farm for\n[29:25] human sacrifices for 100 years and the\n[29:28] talin looked at Cortez and they said we\n[29:30] can use this guy and so they joined him\n[29:33] he had tens of thousands of talin\n[29:35] Warriors oh uh otherwise he would not\n[29:38] have he would not have had that Victory\n[29:40] so what Archaeology would like is to be\n[29:43] in control of expressing that narrative\n[29:46] in its fullest form and I don't think\n[29:49] they know I don't think they can no I\n[29:53] nobody can explain thex explain that\n[29:55] explain those features and those faces\n[29:57] it's a it's a very curious thing and\n[29:59] again and again the moment we start\n[30:01] talking about people's facial features\n[30:03] then they jump in with you're being a\n[30:04] racist you're being a white supremacist\n[30:06] or whatever although the all make heads\n[30:09] don't Ser white supremacism not at all\n[30:11] how how would that be racist is racist\n[30:13] if these were the most advanced\n[30:15] seafaring people alive 6,000 years ago\n[30:18] again would be kind of the opposite the\n[30:20] racism angle is just being used to shut\n[30:22] it down right this is something that we\n[30:24] particularly in the climate in the world\n[30:26] today well Flint does that a lot yeah he\n[30:29] does I saw him do that to Jimmy corsetti\n[30:31] online o over uses of parentheses or or\n[30:35] brackets did you see that I did that\n[30:37] somehow or another that's a code for\n[30:39] Jews like I thought it I thought what he\n[30:42] was doing was avoiding um there's\n[30:45] there's certain algorithms that pick up\n[30:47] on particular words that you use like\n[30:50] you you ever see that people they they\n[30:52] don't like if they want their post to be\n[30:54] more viral they don't write the word\n[30:56] shooter they write s H and then they put\n[30:59] like two asteris and then T RS I've\n[31:02] noticed people doing that yes so what\n[31:04] people are trying to do by blanking out\n[31:06] swear words and cutting out different\n[31:08] words is that you you can bypass\n[31:11] algorithms that selectively remove or\n[31:14] limit the distribution of those kind of\n[31:16] posts with those key words in it yeah so\n[31:18] that apparently was all he was trying to\n[31:19] do was adding brackets to something to\n[31:22] you know to enhance the algorithm to\n[31:24] enhance the algorithm but it's just like\n[31:25] accusing someone of racism it should be\n[31:28] like it should be so it should be very\n[31:31] clear what they're saying there should\n[31:33] be it it shouldn't be you have decided\n[31:35] through some sneaky code to to decide\n[31:38] that this person's racist oh I this code\n[31:41] means this this is a commonly used code\n[31:43] like Yeah from what I understand that\n[31:45] those use of brackets is just to trick\n[31:47] the algorithm yeah yeah just like the\n[31:50] the two asteris for shooter I think it's\n[31:52] I think it's very it's very unfortunate\n[31:55] that in serious and interesting\n[31:57] discussion about the past that this\n[31:59] issue of race immediately gets dumped\n[32:02] into it yeah because those who are\n[32:05] dumping race into the issue know that\n[32:06] that's a way to shut down a conversation\n[32:08] nobody wants to be accused of being a\n[32:09] racist it's also the dumbest suggestion\n[32:13] because the most sophisticated ancient\n[32:16] civilization that's baffling people to\n[32:19] this day is in Africa yeah so shut the\n[32:21] [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up it doesn't make\n[32:23] any sense those were the most advanced\n[32:25] human beings ever and we we disagreement\n[32:28] there's a lot of confusion debate as to\n[32:30] how long ago they were there according\n[32:32] to their hieroglyphs they were there\n[32:33] 30,000 plus years ago but at the very\n[32:36] least those were people in Africa okay\n[32:39] so all the racism [ __ ] should be out the\n[32:40] window because no one's saying that was\n[32:42] anybody else no that was that was an\n[32:44] African civilization they literally have\n[32:45] images of themselves we know what they\n[32:47] look you know at least drawings of what\n[32:48] they looked like we have statues of what\n[32:50] they looked like it was an African\n[32:51] civilization they were the most advanced\n[32:53] people perhaps ever I'm leaning towards\n[32:56] ever I'm leaning towards ever too yeah\n[32:59] because because look uh can we think of\n[33:01] any other civilization that has survived\n[33:04] for 3,000 years right that you go visit\n[33:07] right now that you can go visit right\n[33:08] now T site but but ancient Egypt as a\n[33:10] culture survived for 3,000 years it's\n[33:13] it's it's survived the the the Greek\n[33:15] occupation it survived the previous\n[33:16] Persian occupation it was only the\n[33:18] Romans that that brought it low the the\n[33:21] the the Roman occupation of Egypt was\n[33:23] the beginning of the end to put it into\n[33:25] perspective I always use this quote um I\n[33:27] forget who who came up with this but\n[33:29] it's a Perfect Analogy Cleopatra lived\n[33:32] closer to the invention of the iPhone\n[33:34] than she did to the construction of the\n[33:36] pyramids even if you use the\n[33:38] conventional 2500 BC dating of the the\n[33:42] construction of the pyramids which is\n[33:43] also under debate it's under debate yeah\n[33:46] what Al even if that's true even if it\n[33:48] is 2,500 years ago the most baffling\n[33:51] thing is how did they do it there's no\n[33:54] simple answers I don't give a [ __ ] what\n[33:56] anybody says there's no simple an how\n[33:58] did they do it how did they have such\n[34:00] incredible sophistication in their\n[34:02] construction methods how did they get\n[34:04] those massive 80 plus ton Stones 500\n[34:09] miles down from the mountains with no\n[34:10] equipment no heavy machinery whatever\n[34:13] they did I think it's it's reasonable to\n[34:16] say that in a different way I don't\n[34:19] think they had iPhones I don't think\n[34:20] they had email but they were probably\n[34:22] more sophisticated than us today and\n[34:24] their ability to manipulate Stone and\n[34:26] and make constructions certainly were\n[34:28] and I and I think they had Mastery of\n[34:30] techniques that we don't that we don't\n[34:31] know about yet Perhaps equipment and\n[34:34] perhaps equipment the the the Great\n[34:36] Pyramid remains to me an abiding mystery\n[34:39] which despite probably hundred or more\n[34:43] visits to the Great Pyramid and being\n[34:45] inside it and spending the night in it\n[34:46] and exploring every passage and every\n[34:48] chamber including the relieving\n[34:50] so-called relieving Chambers above the\n[34:52] king's chamber I still can't figure it\n[34:53] out I don't I don't understand how it\n[34:56] was possible to do this and and then the\n[34:59] the time span which egyptology gives us\n[35:01] because egyptology is is fixed on the\n[35:04] idea that the Great Pyramid is a tomb\n[35:08] and only a tomb and then it was built in\n[35:10] about 20 years and 23 years because if\n[35:13] it's the tomb of kufu then it had to be\n[35:15] built in 23 years because that was his\n[35:17] Reign uh he would start in theory\n[35:19] building it at the beginning of his\n[35:20] Reign and and it's finished by the by\n[35:23] the end of his Reign that's 23 years uh\n[35:25] and in the broadest span if you look at\n[35:27] the fourth Dynasty pyramids and even go\n[35:30] back to to the end of the third Dynasty\n[35:32] the Pyramid of Zoser the the the step\n[35:34] pyramid you find that this is a\n[35:36] sudden emergence of incredible skills\n[35:39] which lasts for about a hundred years\n[35:41] and then it goes away it stops the\n[35:43] pyramids that follow the Great Pyramid\n[35:45] of Giza the three pyramids on the Giza\n[35:47] Plateau the pyramids that follow them\n[35:48] the fifth Dynasty pyramids are really\n[35:51] poor they're very very poor quality\n[35:53] workmanship they're falling to pieces\n[35:55] you can hardly recognize from the\n[35:56] outside that they're pyramid at all when\n[35:58] you get inside you do find wonderful\n[36:01] Chambers and you do find what you don't\n[36:02] find in any of the Great Pyramids which\n[36:04] is huge numbers of hieroglyphs uh and\n[36:07] and accounts of the person who was\n[36:10] supposedly buried in that per what do\n[36:11] you think of Christopher Dunn's work\n[36:14] Christopher Dunn came on the podcast and\n[36:16] he explained his theory that he thinks\n[36:19] the Great Pyramid of Giza was some sort\n[36:20] of a power plant I think it's a theory\n[36:23] which deserves to be taken seriously\n[36:24] along with other theories as to what it\n[36:26] is one thing I know for sure is that the\n[36:28] theory that it was just a tomb and\n[36:29] nothing else is bust that is not a\n[36:32] satisfactory Theory anymore so we should\n[36:34] be open to a number of possibilities and\n[36:36] Chris comes to this from a background of\n[36:39] machine tool making uh he's a very\n[36:41] precise guy he's an engineer he\n[36:43] understands this kind of thing and when\n[36:45] he looks at particularly the at Sakara\n[36:48] you have this thing called the serapium\n[36:51] which is an underground Labyrinth uh and\n[36:54] it's got wide corridors through it and\n[36:56] then off each side are rooms\n[36:58] and in each room are these gigantic\n[37:02] Basalt boxes which appear to have held\n[37:06] the corpses of bulls they're they're\n[37:08] they're they're like sarcophagy for\n[37:10] human beings but they're on an enormous\n[37:12] gigantic scale uh weighing hundreds of\n[37:15] tons and cut out of the hardest possible\n[37:18] Rock precisely engineered everything is\n[37:21] exact and it's that amongst other things\n[37:24] that is attracting Chris's attention to\n[37:26] the possibility of of um a lost\n[37:28] technology in in ancient Egypt and then\n[37:31] he asked himself the question well what\n[37:33] was the Great Pyramid if it wasn't a\n[37:34] tomb what what might it have been and\n[37:36] he's come he's come to the solution that\n[37:38] it was some kind of energy generator\n[37:41] some kind of some kind of power plant\n[37:42] and yeah using chemicals and creating\n[37:44] hydrogen and oddly enough there there's\n[37:47] a there's just a recently published\n[37:48] archaeological paper um concerning the\n[37:51] step pyramid at Sakara which is\n[37:54] suggesting that they used Hydraulics to\n[37:56] to lift the big Stones up in up inside\n[37:59] there um and that you know that begins\n[38:01] to come close to the kind of the kind of\n[38:03] technology in some ways that Chris is\n[38:05] that Chris is talking about I think I\n[38:06] think it's worth taking very seriously\n[38:07] I've always had great respect for Chris\n[38:09] I've traveled to Egypt with him um and\n[38:12] um I think he's done very important work\n[38:13] contributing contributing to this and\n[38:15] also looking at the stone the stone\n[38:18] vases from ancient Egypt um I remember\n[38:23] the first time I was drawn to this\n[38:25] mystery which was us of them this is a\n[38:28] 3D print of that's a 3D print of one of\n[38:30] this is a 3D print of an actual stone\n[38:32] aase and it might be like not that\n[38:36] exciting to people like oh what's the\n[38:38] big deal what the big deal is the\n[38:39] Precision in which this was constructed\n[38:42] with handles on it so it couldn't have\n[38:44] been spun on a lathe no because it has\n[38:46] these two handles that are also cut out\n[38:48] of the stone yeah and everything is\n[38:50] precise to within thousands of a human\n[38:53] hair which is bananas yeah it doesn't it\n[38:56] doesn't make sense given what we are\n[38:58] taught was the level of Technology of\n[39:00] Egypt at that time now there is some\n[39:03] dispute of where these came from there\n[39:07] is some dispute about the what what is\n[39:11] have these been made in a modern way and\n[39:13] has someone tried to replace you know\n[39:16] are we looking at fakes or hoes are we\n[39:18] looking at hoaxes well perhaps in some\n[39:20] cases we are but but certainly in others\n[39:22] including those in the in in the great\n[39:25] museums in Cairo they've now moved a of\n[39:27] the content of the Kara Museum out to a\n[39:29] big museum at at at Giza and some of\n[39:31] it's in in transition but they have\n[39:33] thousands of these things the thing is\n[39:35] like even if this was modern technology\n[39:38] we don't know what they did no we don't\n[39:40] know what modern technology exists that\n[39:42] you could take an incredibly hard piece\n[39:45] of stone and cut it into this\n[39:47] unbelievably precise little vase with\n[39:51] handles on it yeah and some bizarre\n[39:53] method that we don't know and hollowed\n[39:55] out the inside of it and some of them\n[39:57] with very thin necks and then a hollowed\n[40:00] out ins like how how did you do that\n[40:02] very thin necks and then this bulbous\n[40:05] base base to it it's all perfect there's\n[40:07] another piece which it's hard to\n[40:09] describe but it's got a it's got a\n[40:10] series of three flanges that come across\n[40:13] it's like a wheel um but it's a nobody\n[40:17] knows what it is um and it's it's cut\n[40:20] out of incredibly hard rock or cut or\n[40:22] shaped in some way I've never seen a\n[40:24] satisfactory explanation for this for\n[40:26] this thing I wish I could call up a\n[40:28] picture but I don't know do you know\n[40:30] what it's called I can't remember Jam's\n[40:32] a wizard at find I've written about it\n[40:34] in uh in Fingerprints of the Gods let's\n[40:36] see I bet Jamie's already found it is\n[40:37] that\n[40:38] it no yes top left that's the one that\n[40:43] when I first saw that in the KY Museum I\n[40:46] it's car from schist you know this thing\n[40:47] is hard and and when I first saw that in\n[40:50] the Kira Museum I I thought how on Earth\n[40:53] did they do this why isn't this a big\n[40:55] mystery why isn't is being seen as a\n[40:58] mystery because that looks like a a\n[40:59] piece of an engine it does doesn't it it\n[41:01] looks like that that looks like\n[41:03] something I'd find on my Land Cruiser\n[41:05] yeah it looks like part of something\n[41:06] else we're finding a bit of something\n[41:09] larger wow that looks like to me like\n[41:12] some part of some kind of machine yeah\n[41:15] that's the only thing that it looks like\n[41:17] yeah that's that's exactly what if you\n[41:18] know like Automobiles and parts and you\n[41:20] look at something like that like oh yeah\n[41:21] that goes probably in there somewhere\n[41:23] exactly exactly and what what is its\n[41:25] function if it isn't something else it's\n[41:27] difficult to see what function it could\n[41:28] have how it could be what is the\n[41:30] conventional explanation of what this\n[41:32] this thing is some kind of offering ball\n[41:34] click on that the disc the this that\n[41:37] article okay Sabu disc an ancient\n[41:40] Egyptian artifact from the first dynasty\n[41:42] 300 to 2800 BC found in 1936 in North\n[41:47] how do you say that Sakara Sakara Sakara\n[41:49] necropolis and UHA maaba s311 those are\n[41:54] sort of uh tombs which have got two\n[41:56] levels m H what an incredible piece it\n[41:59] is an incredible piece I had never seen\n[42:01] that before and there it is first\n[42:02] dynasty and of course you can't actually\n[42:05] date the object itself so they're dating\n[42:06] it from Context what they're saying is\n[42:08] that it was found in a first dynasty\n[42:10] context but it may have been a legacy\n[42:12] even then it may have been an old object\n[42:14] even then we just don't know that but\n[42:15] it's at least exactly but it's at least\n[42:18] that old from the context so it's at\n[42:19] least 3,000 years old they think it was\n[42:21] used excuse me 3,000 BC they think it\n[42:24] was used in brewing beer as a mash r to\n[42:27] mix and even out the mixture of grains\n[42:29] and hot water in a big Mash turn ton I\n[42:33] don't know what that means I don't know\n[42:35] either but I would have thought that if\n[42:36] that was your project you could do it\n[42:38] without carving shift shist into that\n[42:40] click on that thing what is the\n[42:41] mysterious Egyptian dis what it says it\n[42:44] right there that's it can we click on\n[42:47] that can go full scale on that so I can\n[42:49] see what that looks\n[42:50] like\n[42:52] wow that's\n[42:54] wild yeah it really is such a specific\n[42:58] shape like if you're going to just use\n[42:59] that to make beer that it seems weird\n[43:02] and it's a lot of work to make beer you\n[43:04] could you could do it in other ways that\n[43:05] looks like some kind of a fan to me MH\n[43:08] it looks like something that would be on\n[43:09] a belt yeah you know like on a on some\n[43:11] sort of\n[43:13] a or something it looks like a fan yeah\n[43:17] it it could be looks like it looks like\n[43:19] those those things underneath it it\n[43:20] looks like that's how you would funnel\n[43:23] water or air through yeah it it it it\n[43:25] clearly had a function no nobody would\n[43:27] go to the trouble of of creating\n[43:29] something as complex and difficult to\n[43:31] make as this unless there was a useful\n[43:32] function for what is it made out of\n[43:34] shist which is a hot stone that's crazy\n[43:36] that that's made out of stone yeah like\n[43:38] how did you cut out of one piece of\n[43:40] stone how did you do that and what are\n[43:42] the how are the the measurements of that\n[43:44] oh look it's Georgio he says it's aliens\n[43:47] I'm just gonna\n[43:48] guess is um this this thing that's cut\n[43:52] out of this in oops lost it there for a\n[43:54] second this thing that's cut out of this\n[43:56] incred hard Stone\n[43:59] like do they have any sort of an or a\n[44:03] guess of how someone would cut something\n[44:04] like that I've never I've never seen a\n[44:06] satisfactory guess um but but those like\n[44:09] Chris Dunn who are studying the\n[44:10] technology of ancient Egypt are are are\n[44:13] confident that we're looking at the\n[44:14] traces of a lost technology we don't\n[44:16] know how this was done like so much else\n[44:18] in ancient like we don't know how the 70\n[44:20] ton blocks were raised to become the\n[44:22] roof of the king's chamber either in the\n[44:24] in in the great pyr there's so much that\n[44:25] we don't know and that's not explained\n[44:27] and that is easily written off by by um\n[44:32] abusively arrogant uh experts who say\n[44:35] there's no mystery here that doesn't\n[44:37] look super precise in terms of the the\n[44:39] radius of it when you're looking at it\n[44:41] it looks like it it looks handmade\n[44:44] doesn't it I'm sure it is handmade the\n[44:45] question is how right but you know what\n[44:47] I'm saying so are these vases right yeah\n[44:49] yeah but there's something about it\n[44:50] that's like a little more crude yeah but\n[44:52] it probably didn't have to be precise\n[44:54] because whatever it did\n[44:57] had of Spin and it survived through at\n[44:59] least 5,000 years it definitely looks\n[45:01] like it was something that spun right\n[45:02] cuz you have that hollowed out piece in\n[45:04] the center that you would have an axle\n[45:05] on or something along those lines it\n[45:08] looks like it's welded in certain spots\n[45:09] too but like\n[45:11] how how do they weld Stone how well\n[45:14] apparently they carve that shape out of\n[45:16] just one that's crazy now that one looks\n[45:19] Ultra precise this one might have been\n[45:20] remade off of the original maybe click\n[45:22] on that see I would say that's a remake\n[45:24] is it\n[45:27] if it's not it's insane that's even more\n[45:29] insane cuz that looks so perfect why\n[45:32] does that look different than the other\n[45:34] images I don't know well go back to that\n[45:37] one where it's spinning\n[45:39] around yeah look at it when it spins\n[45:41] around looks pretty precise yeah they do\n[45:44] look like they've recreate did they only\n[45:46] find one and they've recreated for\n[45:47] museums or is no there there there's\n[45:50] there's one original I've no doubt\n[45:51] people have tried to make copies with\n[45:52] with modern materials but definitely\n[45:54] we're looking at a few different\n[45:55] versions of it yeah well also you got to\n[45:57] think if it is made out of stone some of\n[45:59] the edges have to be beat up just from\n[46:01] being in the ground for thousands of\n[46:03] years it's not the same you sure it's\n[46:05] not just a different lighting beat up\n[46:07] like\n[46:07] the smooth the other one was smooth\n[46:11] that's smooth that that almost that does\n[46:13] look like a recreation doesn't it yeah\n[46:14] it is I think that's that we're looking\n[46:16] at a recreation okay whatever it is the\n[46:18] thing is where you come where you come\n[46:19] to this there's there's thousands of\n[46:21] objects that that defy explanation from\n[46:24] what are those Jamie put that back up\n[46:26] what are those things click Wheels you\n[46:27] know what those are says first\n[46:30] Wheels oh 48 4,000 700 Wheels 1500 BC\n[46:37] basically uh and that's the weird one of\n[46:41] the weirder things about Egypt right we\n[46:42] don't think they had the wheel no they\n[46:44] definitely had the wheel whether they\n[46:46] had the wheel in the Old Kingdom right\n[46:48] uh is another question but certainly by\n[46:50] by the New Kingdom by the time of rames\n[46:52] they had Wheels they had chariots but I\n[46:54] mean the people that built the pyramids\n[46:56] um 2500 BC is not like when do they\n[46:59] think the wheel was invented well it's\n[47:02] actually not clear to me when the wheel\n[47:04] was invented let's see what the con I\n[47:05] thought the conventional um guess of\n[47:08] when the invention of the wheel was was\n[47:10] post the construction of the pyramids I\n[47:12] believe that's the case but the one of\n[47:14] the things about wheel is you have to\n[47:16] ask yourself in what circumstances in\n[47:19] what places in what conditions are\n[47:20] wheels\n[47:21] useful there are some conditions in in\n[47:23] which a wheel is not a useful thing and\n[47:25] which it's going to get bogged down in\n[47:26] the which is not going to be helpful um\n[47:30] so so um the use of sleds was certainly\n[47:34] part of how ancient Egyptians moved huge\n[47:37] stones and I don't dispute that the\n[47:40] problem is how they then get those\n[47:41] stones 300 feet in the air uh you can\n[47:44] slide anything on wet sand on a sled\n[47:46] with enough people pulling it but how do\n[47:48] you get it to the top of the king's\n[47:49] chamber how do you get it to the top of\n[47:50] the king's chamber that's that's the\n[47:51] problem to fit it perfectly perectly\n[47:53] perfectly and and you know I've i' I've\n[47:56] been up there and been in every one of\n[47:57] the chambers above and each one of them\n[47:59] is flawed with these 70 ton blocks and\n[48:01] roofed with it it's so nuts it doesn't\n[48:03] even seem like a thousand years more\n[48:04] advanced than us it seems like thousands\n[48:06] of years more advanced more advanced in\n[48:08] a different way I think I think this is\n[48:10] part of the problem where I've been\n[48:12] perhaps misunderstood by egyptologist\n[48:14] when I talk about an advanced\n[48:15] civilization I I keep trying to\n[48:17] emphasize that we shouldn't look for\n[48:19] ourselves in the past that if we're\n[48:21] going to go back 10,000 12,000 15,000\n[48:24] years into the past and talk about a\n[48:25] civilization it's not going to be like\n[48:26] us it's going to be very different it's\n[48:28] going to have different priorities\n[48:29] different ways of of looking at things\n[48:31] but one of the things that the ancient\n[48:33] Egyptians had which I'm not aware that\n[48:35] any other civilization has had is the\n[48:37] ability to sustain essentially a single\n[48:40] culture with a single set of spiritual\n[48:43] ideas and to sustain that for 3,000\n[48:45] years and and to keep people happy and\n[48:48] fed and well- looked after you know this\n[48:50] is this is an amazing achievement\n[48:51] amazing stability uh when when you look\n[48:53] at it what our civilization how old is\n[48:56] it really we trace it back to the Romans\n[48:58] probably not right maybe maybe uh 500\n[49:01] years the beginning of mechanization and\n[49:04] and so on and so forth in our\n[49:05] civilization pretty amazing yeah if you\n[49:08] think just there's so many Mysteries to\n[49:10] it for anybody to pretend that they have\n[49:12] all the answers to something as\n[49:13] perplexing as Egypt I think the you know\n[49:17] this is this is an area where where um I\n[49:21] often I often get criticized but but uh\n[49:24] I think we when we look at a\n[49:25] civilization and what it is and what's\n[49:28] it's achieving and and why it's so\n[49:30] special when we look at our civilization\n[49:32] today we are fantastic at technology we\n[49:35] we are brilliant at at science we can\n[49:38] make the best possible\n[49:40] machines um and and we're a society that\n[49:43] is built around production and\n[49:44] consumption and a society in which\n[49:46] people Define themselves in terms of\n[49:48] what they own and what they possess what\n[49:51] they what they produce um and and it\n[49:53] becomes a very materialistic Society\n[49:56] soety that's focused on material things\n[49:58] where we Define ourselves by our\n[50:00] material possessions ancient Egypt had a\n[50:02] totally different Focus yeah they were\n[50:04] great at making material things but that\n[50:06] was secondary their their main thing was\n[50:09] what are we here for why are we living\n[50:10] this life what what happens to us when\n[50:12] we die they they investigated that\n[50:14] mystery more deeply than any other\n[50:17] culture that that I know of and they\n[50:18] were doing so right from the beginning\n[50:21] uh of of records and they were\n[50:23] documenting this journey to the\n[50:25] afterlife absolutely in hieroglyphs and\n[50:28] it's like what what were you documenting\n[50:30] like how do you know like what were you\n[50:31] trying how why how did everyone agree on\n[50:33] this particular myth or this story\n[50:36] unless there was some experience being\n[50:38] brought to bear in it it's one of the\n[50:40] things that we point out in in season\n[50:43] two um is is that the ancient Egyptian\n[50:46] notion of a leap to the sky after death\n[50:49] to the Milky Way of a journey along the\n[50:51] Milky Way of encountering challenges and\n[50:53] dangers and risks there monsters that\n[50:55] would block your path Gates that you had\n[50:57] to know the password to get through that\n[50:59] idea is found all over the world the the\n[51:02] path of souls it's found all over the\n[51:04] Americas that that what do you think\n[51:06] that they're trying to say well I think\n[51:08] that I think first of all it's it's\n[51:10] evidence of a remote common origin of\n[51:12] this idea it's when it's found amongst\n[51:14] cultures all around the world that's\n[51:16] apparently had no contact with one\n[51:17] another and are often separated by\n[51:19] hundreds or thousands of years the same\n[51:21] idea is found about what happens to us\n[51:23] after death the only reasonable\n[51:25] explanation I can come up with is that\n[51:27] they've all inherited this idea and then\n[51:29] developed it in their own ways from a\n[51:31] remote common source and that's one of\n[51:32] the main reasons that I'm curious about\n[51:34] the possibility of A Lost Civilization\n[51:36] that these spiritual ideas are found all\n[51:39] around the world uh and they they\n[51:42] involve the Journey of the Soul after\n[51:44] death and a leap a leap to the heavens\n[51:46] and sometimes it's called an underworld\n[51:48] but really it's set in the sky and this\n[51:50] journey that that takes place where you\n[51:52] are judged on what you've done with your\n[51:55] life this is something something else\n[51:56] that we avoid in the world today is\n[51:58] taking responsibility for our own lives\n[52:02] uh the ancient Egyptians required you to\n[52:03] take responsibility for your life uh and\n[52:06] if you did not do so the outcome after\n[52:08] death would not be good uh you had to\n[52:12] um you had to celebrate the gift of life\n[52:15] you had to you had to realize the\n[52:17] incredible gift that you had been given\n[52:20] um and one of the opportunities of that\n[52:22] gift is the opportunity to accumulate\n[52:24] wisdom uh and that's one of the things\n[52:27] hopefully that we all do as we get older\n[52:29] is get a bit more a bit more wisdom and\n[52:31] a bit more understanding but in the case\n[52:33] of ancient Egypt that idea is developed\n[52:36] over over 3,000 years and it's\n[52:38] essentially the same at the beginning as\n[52:40] it is as as it is at the end uh that the\n[52:43] soul that death is not the end this is\n[52:47] this is the conclusion of a society that\n[52:50] put its best Minds at work for 3,000\n[52:52] years on this problem the death is not\n[52:54] the end we may think it is scientists\n[52:55] may tell us it is but when a scientist\n[52:58] says death is the end there's nothing\n[53:00] more we're just physical bodies and when\n[53:03] the light goes out it goes out forever\n[53:05] that's actually not a scientific fact\n[53:07] that's that's not something that's been\n[53:08] investigated or can be investig\n[53:10] Consciousness itself is so confusing\n[53:13] just just Consciousness just like what\n[53:15] is it why are we conscious what what\n[53:17] what is it local or are we tuning into\n[53:19] Consciousness and uh when you die\n[53:21] where's that go where's that energy go\n[53:24] is that is a soul a real thing like\n[53:27] what is the essence of life what is the\n[53:29] essence of human life and human\n[53:31] consciousness those are perplexing\n[53:33] questions they're very perplexing\n[53:35] questions which which uh actually are of\n[53:38] great significance to every one of us\n[53:40] yeah I mean suppose death just is the\n[53:42] end then that's a that's a way not to\n[53:45] have to take too much responsibility for\n[53:47] our lives for the impact that we've had\n[53:49] on others for the pain that we may have\n[53:52] caused or for the joy that we may have\n[53:54] caused if if if if death's the end\n[53:57] there's there's no up or downside to\n[53:59] that whatever whatever we do but from\n[54:01] the ancient Egyptian point of view\n[54:02] death's not the end and you have been\n[54:05] given the precious gift of Life what did\n[54:08] you do with it and there are there are\n[54:09] moral aspects to that question there\n[54:11] there's these 42 assessors they're\n[54:13] called the negative assessors who ask\n[54:15] the soul of the deceased questions about\n[54:18] what they did in life and those are all\n[54:19] moral questions they bear some\n[54:21] relationship actually to the to the Ten\n[54:23] Commandments um but um there's another\n[54:27] question which is called the weighing of\n[54:28] words and and that question is what did\n[54:30] you do with the gift we gave you we gave\n[54:32] you the gift of the human life we gave\n[54:34] you the gift of the opportunity to love\n[54:37] or to hate at your choice we gave you\n[54:39] the gift to live in a human body to have\n[54:42] this incredible Consciousness to be able\n[54:43] to integrate all kinds of information\n[54:46] from all kinds of spheres what did you\n[54:48] do with it did did you leave the world a\n[54:51] better place or a worse place than when\n[54:53] you came into it did you hurt and damage\n[54:55] and cause pain pain to others\n[54:57] consistently out of wicked intent not\n[55:00] accidentally but deliberately causing\n[55:02] pain and there are human beings who do\n[55:03] that for the ancient Egyptians that kind\n[55:06] of behavior meant an introduction to\n[55:09] Amit the Eater of the dead and an Amit\n[55:13] is displayed in in the Judgment scene\n[55:15] he's a he's a creature part hyena part\n[55:17] lion um and he sits there and certain\n[55:20] Souls do not go on their Journey ends\n[55:23] and it ends because of the choices they\n[55:26] made during life and because they never\n[55:28] took responsibility for what they did\n[55:31] well it kind of makes sense a natural\n[55:32] selection of the souls in a way that if\n[55:35] there's natural selection of humans and\n[55:37] natural selection of animals that allows\n[55:39] them to to prosper like and to get\n[55:42] better and to evolve it makes sense that\n[55:44] that would that would happen with the\n[55:45] soul as well I'm just so confused as to\n[55:49] what the environment was like that\n[55:51] allowed these people\n[55:53] to keep this this in insane civilization\n[55:57] developing and innovating for so long\n[56:00] that they were so more advanced than\n[56:02] anyone else that was alive back then\n[56:03] that were aware of at least as far as\n[56:05] like what we've uncovered what they left\n[56:07] behind the beautiful art that they made\n[56:09] yeah the Perfection of their geometry\n[56:12] their incredibly Advanced astronomy uh\n[56:15] all of these things are the are the\n[56:16] Hallmarks of a very sophisticated very\n[56:18] Advanced civilization sure they didn't\n[56:20] have iPhones but yeah but just a\n[56:22] sophistication of the the the symmetry\n[56:24] of the facial structure of the St\n[56:26] yeah in incredible beautiful things\n[56:29] beautiful\n[56:31] bizarrely bizarrely technologically\n[56:34] advanced bizarrely because to to perform\n[56:37] something like that you need incredible\n[56:39] tools of measurement enormous statues\n[56:42] that have faces that are absolutely\n[56:44] perfectly symmetrical how did you do\n[56:46] that yeah how' you how' you stand that\n[56:48] up well the answer is we we don't know\n[56:50] we don't know there's so much that we\n[56:52] don't know and and and it's that it's\n[56:54] that attitude towards the past which I\n[56:56] think would be more helpful is that we\n[56:59] have we have this\n[57:03] mysterious background to we human beings\n[57:06] as you said earlier anatomically modern\n[57:09] humans we think that they first appeared\n[57:11] about 300,000 years ago Jebel ER Hood in\n[57:14] Morocco 310,000 years ago now I can\n[57:17] remember a time not so long ago back in\n[57:19] the 1990s when when it was thought that\n[57:22] the first anatomically modern humans\n[57:24] were as recent as 50,000 years ago and\n[57:27] then they shifted it new finds were made\n[57:29] to 110,000 years ago now 310,000 years\n[57:32] ago we don't really know how far into\n[57:35] the past that goes and we don't know\n[57:37] about the Neanderthals and the\n[57:39] denisovans who were also human beings uh\n[57:42] certainly they were human the same\n[57:44] species as us because they could into\n[57:45] breed with us uh you can't breed with\n[57:47] another species uh so so and that takes\n[57:50] the Journey Back even further and that's\n[57:52] one of the reasons why I have a problem\n[57:55] with notion that Civilization just\n[57:57] emerges 6,000 years ago uh because we\n[58:01] had the same kit the same wiring the\n[58:03] same brains for at least 300,000 years\n[58:06] and we weren't doing any of this stuff\n[58:08] apparently uh I suspect we were but it's\n[58:10] not made the record well it seems that\n[58:12] that what they were dealing with in\n[58:14] terms of the resources in the Nile\n[58:17] Valley was unbelievably Bountiful it was\n[58:20] Bountiful and that's probably one of the\n[58:22] reasons before the climate shifted and\n[58:24] changed and it became aot of desert\n[58:27] before that it was probably incredibly\n[58:29] Bountiful and that allowed them to stay\n[58:32] there for a long period of time and not\n[58:34] have to worry about food it certainly\n[58:36] did uh the Bounty however goes back much\n[58:38] further uh this is one of the reasons\n[58:40] why I kept on trying to talk about the\n[58:43] Sahara during the debate uh this vast\n[58:45] area uh which frankly has not been\n[58:48] studied properly by archaeology at all\n[58:51] uh hardly a fraction of it has been\n[58:53] studied uh this vast area\n[58:56] I'm often accused of creating a what\n[58:59] they call a god of the gaps argument I'm\n[59:01] saying you haven't looked enough in the\n[59:03] Sahara you haven't looked enough in the\n[59:06] submerged Continental shelves you\n[59:08] haven't looked enough uh in the Amazon\n[59:10] rainforest and and the argument is that\n[59:12] I'm I'm trying to put my Lost\n[59:13] Civilization into these gaps but these\n[59:16] are very special gaps the the the\n[59:19] submerged Continental shelves were Prime\n[59:22] real estate during the Ice Age that was\n[59:24] the that was the place to be just as it\n[59:26] is today to be to be near coastlines the\n[59:29] Amazon rainforest was a bountiful was\n[59:31] was a bountiful place and the Sahara\n[59:33] Desert was green and Rich for thousands\n[59:36] of years during the Ice Age with lakes\n[59:38] with rivers uh it was the kind of place\n[59:40] where a civilization might well have\n[59:43] emerged they find whalebones there\n[59:47] whales so anybody who doesn't think\n[59:49] there's a mystery in the Sahara Desert\n[59:51] yeah and anybody who really tries to\n[59:54] dismiss the notion that most of it\n[59:56] hasn't been really excavated but it\n[59:59] really hasn't been no it hasn't it's\n[01:00:00] it's it's too vast it's too vast and\n[01:00:02] it's too expensive to the excavation\n[01:00:05] like you would have\n[01:00:07] to you're dealing with a place where how\n[01:00:10] many people even live there nobody knows\n[01:00:14] because it's not been investigated\n[01:00:16] properly it's a\n[01:00:18] desert uh and and uh it's had relatively\n[01:00:21] little attention we do know there's some\n[01:00:23] amazing rock art from the upper\n[01:00:25] Paleolithic\n[01:00:26] in in tassle in Algeria in in the Sahara\n[01:00:30] um but not enough has been done this is\n[01:00:32] this is the this is the problem for me\n[01:00:35] with saying archaeology's basically got\n[01:00:37] the story of the human past nailed down\n[01:00:38] is that there's huge areas which have\n[01:00:40] not been investigated and I reject the\n[01:00:43] idea that that is a god of the gaps\n[01:00:44] argument because that's not why I'm\n[01:00:46] proposing There Was A Lost Civilization\n[01:00:49] and that's all I'm doing I'm not\n[01:00:50] insisting I'm not demanding that people\n[01:00:52] believe me I'm just I just want to\n[01:00:54] inject this idea into the discussion so\n[01:00:57] that it could can be considered\n[01:01:00] when taken out of context was a little\n[01:01:03] clip where you asked me is in during the\n[01:01:05] debate um is there any evidence for your\n[01:01:08] Lost Civilization in what they've found\n[01:01:11] and I said in what they' found no and\n[01:01:14] then I went on to say um but that brings\n[01:01:16] us to the point of what they've looked\n[01:01:19] for and what they've not looked for what\n[01:01:21] they've found and what they've not found\n[01:01:23] um that has been taken again and again\n[01:01:25] as as me saying that there's no evidence\n[01:01:27] for my Lost Civilization whereas what\n[01:01:29] I'm actually saying is there's no\n[01:01:31] evidence in what archaeologists have\n[01:01:33] studied uh for A Lost Civilization\n[01:01:35] because I'm not studying what\n[01:01:37] archaeologists study I am very happy to\n[01:01:40] use material from archaeologists and I\n[01:01:43] could not do what I do if I didn't use\n[01:01:46] material from archaeologists it's very\n[01:01:48] important basis to my work however it's\n[01:01:51] the astronomy it's the astronomical\n[01:01:53] alignments it's the Precision it's the\n[01:01:55] Precision of the Great Pyramid it's the\n[01:01:58] myths it's the myths of a global flood\n[01:02:00] all around the world this is It's a\n[01:02:03] universal story of a massive cataclysm\n[01:02:06] with a few survivors who bring their\n[01:02:08] knowledge to others this story this is\n[01:02:10] one of the reasons why I think the\n[01:02:12] Atlantis story which which Flint dible\n[01:02:14] is so opposed to deserves to be taken\n[01:02:17] seriously uh because it's part of a\n[01:02:21] global tradition it's yet another flood\n[01:02:23] myth in fact it's the story it's just\n[01:02:25] like those 150 or 200 other flood\n[01:02:27] Traditions that come from around the\n[01:02:29] world and it's not enough for\n[01:02:31] archaeologists to say oh people\n[01:02:32] experienced a little local River flood\n[01:02:35] uh or or there was a tidal wave that day\n[01:02:37] and so they decided that the whole world\n[01:02:39] was submerged with water that doesn't\n[01:02:40] satisfy me at all the fact that this is\n[01:02:43] found all around the world to me is a\n[01:02:45] memory of something that happened to our\n[01:02:47] ancestors something so traumatic\n[01:02:49] something so huge that it's been\n[01:02:51] preserved better than almost anything\n[01:02:53] else from our past what what is your\n[01:02:55] take on the right rart Str am I saying\n[01:02:56] that right rart structure structure\n[01:02:59] morania\n[01:03:01] um I I would not like to say one way or\n[01:03:04] the other because I've not been there um\n[01:03:06] I've not I've not had boots on the\n[01:03:07] ground there I've not been able to look\n[01:03:08] at it yes it's very intriguing very I um\n[01:03:13] also the salt all around it yeah where\n[01:03:15] it shows that at one point in time it\n[01:03:17] was probably submerged like something\n[01:03:19] happened probably was but you might have\n[01:03:20] to go back many millions of years to get\n[01:03:22] to get to that point the honest answer\n[01:03:24] to that question is I don't know I'm\n[01:03:25] open-minded on the rad structure it's\n[01:03:27] something that I would like to I would\n[01:03:29] like to study um but I have not uh had\n[01:03:32] had time to yet in in future work it's\n[01:03:34] something that I may that I may study\n[01:03:36] and after studying it I may come to the\n[01:03:37] conclusion that it's just a remarkable\n[01:03:39] natural phenomenon of which there are\n[01:03:41] many or I may come to a different\n[01:03:43] conclusion it depends what the what the\n[01:03:45] evidence shows me but I try not to to\n[01:03:47] spout off on things that I'm not\n[01:03:49] personally acquainted with and don't\n[01:03:50] really know about well good for you I\n[01:03:52] like to spout it off uh it's also like\n[01:03:54] there's so many of those things that\n[01:03:55] people thought were myth like Troy Troy\n[01:03:57] yeah and they find it find by an amateur\n[01:04:00] turns out to be turns out to be a real\n[01:04:02] place I think the myths are the memory\n[01:04:05] banks of our species uh and I don't\n[01:04:07] think archaeology takes them seriously\n[01:04:09] enough there's a tendency to just\n[01:04:10] dismiss them as fantasies uh as as\n[01:04:14] things that were made up by by the\n[01:04:15] ancients for some bizarre reason of\n[01:04:18] their own but they're The Memories We\n[01:04:20] have from the time before writing from\n[01:04:22] the time before documents were kept uh\n[01:04:25] and they're a precious resource in in\n[01:04:28] understanding our past so it's it's\n[01:04:30] things like that and then at the end of\n[01:04:31] the day to say to twist what I said uh\n[01:04:35] that in in what archaeologists have\n[01:04:38] studied there's no evidence from my Lost\n[01:04:40] Civilization uh is is uh is completely\n[01:04:43] wrong because I've I've I've written\n[01:04:45] thousands of pages of books this is this\n[01:04:47] is one of the issues like in that debate\n[01:04:49] I was supposed to prove everything about\n[01:04:51] A Lost Civilization I didn't even come\n[01:04:53] here to prove it I came here to explain\n[01:04:55] why I'm interested in it and why I want\n[01:04:57] to share my interest and my curiosity\n[01:05:01] about the past uh with others but if if\n[01:05:04] I'm asked to prove it I would say don't\n[01:05:06] refer to what I managed to say during a\n[01:05:08] three-hour debate I'd say refer to to\n[01:05:10] the the eight or so major books that\n[01:05:12] I've written with thousands of pages and\n[01:05:15] thousands of documented footnotes that's\n[01:05:17] where my my argument is in place and\n[01:05:19] you'll find that that argument is not\n[01:05:20] based on what archaeologists have\n[01:05:22] studied it's based precisely on what\n[01:05:24] they've not studied about the past\n[01:05:27] well regardless of the argument that\n[01:05:30] Flint tried to put forth that there's no\n[01:05:34] evidence of what you're saying the\n[01:05:37] exaggeration of the shipwrecks the the\n[01:05:39] stuff about\n[01:05:40] seeds the the fact is this resonates\n[01:05:43] with a lot of people this this mystery\n[01:05:45] is perplexing it's it's confusing and\n[01:05:48] there's a lot of it out there it's not\n[01:05:51] like one site like Egypt there's a ton\n[01:05:54] of sites yeah the uh Sage wall in\n[01:05:57] Montana what do you think of that thing\n[01:05:59] again I will withhold judgment until I\n[01:06:01] have my boots on the ground there and\n[01:06:03] have a look at it and even then that\n[01:06:04] might not be enough I do know that the\n[01:06:06] property owners there are doing a lot of\n[01:06:08] ground penetrating radar uh and there\n[01:06:10] may be results from that but at the\n[01:06:12] moment I would not say that's definitely\n[01:06:15] a man-made structure nor would I say\n[01:06:17] that's definitely a natural structure I\n[01:06:18] would say that's an intriguing structure\n[01:06:20] uh but it is in a geological context\n[01:06:22] where other things like that are found\n[01:06:24] if I if I were asked to put money there\n[01:06:25] it is yeah Bo that looks I mean it\n[01:06:28] really is hard it is hard to resist the\n[01:06:30] conclusion I mean it's super hard to\n[01:06:32] resist the idea that that's man-made and\n[01:06:34] especially if it goes deeper under the\n[01:06:35] ground than they think it does they\n[01:06:37] think it goes oh it does it it goes It\n[01:06:39] goes deeper that's what the what the\n[01:06:40] ground penetrating radar how far is\n[01:06:42] about 30\n[01:06:44] ftt in fact I was I was yesterday so\n[01:06:47] manmade yeah it really does it when I\n[01:06:50] look at that photograph to me that is a\n[01:06:52] that is a man-made structure but I\n[01:06:55] realized now in the environment in which\n[01:06:57] I live surrounded by archaeologists who\n[01:07:00] are extremely hostile to my work that I\n[01:07:03] better it it's not in my interests to\n[01:07:06] LEAP to a conclusion about anything of\n[01:07:08] course before I've before I've studied\n[01:07:10] it and I do intend to go to Sage wall I\n[01:07:12] was yesterday with with Michael Collins\n[01:07:14] who's the guy who's done a lot of the\n[01:07:15] videography on Sage wall he doesn't know\n[01:07:17] whether it's natural or man-made either\n[01:07:19] more work needs to be done but it's an\n[01:07:22] intriguing issue and it may be part of\n[01:07:24] the Lost history of the Americas we just\n[01:07:26] don't know yet what's crazy is if that\n[01:07:28] is how old is that thing how old is it\n[01:07:31] who knows yeah who knows and if you're\n[01:07:33] talking about Footprints of people that\n[01:07:35] lived 22,000 years ago yeah like what\n[01:07:37] were they making things like what yeah\n[01:07:39] what was going on did they build\n[01:07:40] something like that yeah or or or even\n[01:07:43] earlier right um is or even earlier is\n[01:07:45] it part of the part of the lost story of\n[01:07:47] the Americas there's so much that's been\n[01:07:48] lost particularly in in North America um\n[01:07:52] with the the massive destruction that\n[01:07:54] took place during the 19th and 18th and\n[01:07:57] early 20th century um it's reckoned that\n[01:08:00] there were a million Mound sites in\n[01:08:03] North America uh if you go back to\n[01:08:06] 1500 uh there's about 100,000 left uh\n[01:08:10] which is a lot actually um but most of\n[01:08:13] them are massively destroyed and the\n[01:08:15] other 900,000 uh have gone uh just\n[01:08:18] plowed under turned into into into\n[01:08:21] farmland and how much else of the of the\n[01:08:23] prehistory of North America has been\n[01:08:25] lost as a result of a process where\n[01:08:27] where first of all there was a\n[01:08:29] conviction that the indigenous\n[01:08:30] inhabitants had only been here for a\n[01:08:32] very short time whereas we now know\n[01:08:34] they've been here for a very long time\n[01:08:36] uh and and secondly there was a\n[01:08:39] propagandistic desire not to give too\n[01:08:40] much credit to them so let's get rid of\n[01:08:43] let's get rid of some of their stuff wow\n[01:08:45] I was very disappointed when we were\n[01:08:46] shooting season 2 of ancient apocalypse\n[01:08:49] that uh we were not allowed by the\n[01:08:51] authorities to film in Cahokia which is\n[01:08:54] one of the Great uh the great Mounds\n[01:08:57] that still survive um because they've\n[01:09:00] been told that I'm a pseudo\n[01:09:01] archaeologist and that I'm going to\n[01:09:02] mislead the public if I go there so so\n[01:09:05] the best way is just to stop me going\n[01:09:06] there we tried to film in mville in\n[01:09:08] Alabama as well and again we were denied\n[01:09:12] permission to to film there there's no\n[01:09:14] doubt that archaeology has joined ranks\n[01:09:16] uh to do their best to prevent me doing\n[01:09:19] what I do that's so awful to deny anyone\n[01:09:23] the ability to especially going to put\n[01:09:25] something like this on Netflix where\n[01:09:27] millions of people are going to see it\n[01:09:29] deny people the just the access through\n[01:09:32] video of experiencing this site and the\n[01:09:35] Mystery that's attached to it like who\n[01:09:37] are these people why did they build this\n[01:09:40] what what artifacts haven't been\n[01:09:42] discovered that are in inside of this\n[01:09:44] thing and you know here's what\n[01:09:45] archaeologists say here's an alternative\n[01:09:47] point of view yeah you're an intelligent\n[01:09:49] member of the public make up your own\n[01:09:50] mind you're being reasonable that's\n[01:09:52] outrageous\n[01:09:55] it's it's it's a most unfortunate thing\n[01:09:58] well um it's it's not unfortunate that\n[01:10:01] there's a lot of people that are\n[01:10:03] interested in it though more and more\n[01:10:05] it's it's a fascinating phenomenon I I I\n[01:10:07] do see it as an extension of our of our\n[01:10:10] interest in our own genetic Origins for\n[01:10:13] example a lot of people I haven't done\n[01:10:14] it yet but I I'm kind of keen to do 23\n[01:10:17] in May or whatever it's called I\n[01:10:18] wouldn't do it no not now no they sell\n[01:10:21] your data away they'll sell your data\n[01:10:23] now someone's going to know your exact\n[01:10:24] DNA yeah the whole thing's nuts like I\n[01:10:27] didn't know that they could do that but\n[01:10:28] apparently they have not only that\n[01:10:30] databases get breached and they find my\n[01:10:34] my eldest son uh who is half Somali and\n[01:10:37] half half English had his DNA done with\n[01:10:41] 23 and me and um he found what it showed\n[01:10:45] was that he's 50%\n[01:10:48] African and\n[01:10:50] 49% British and 1% Spanish oh and and we\n[01:10:55] tried to figure that out and the answer\n[01:10:57] is that my ancestors came from Cornwall\n[01:10:59] in the southwest of England and that's\n[01:11:02] where the Spanish Armada washed up and\n[01:11:05] the survivors of the Spanish Armada\n[01:11:06] washed up and then integrated with the\n[01:11:07] local community and contributed their\n[01:11:09] genes so you know there is an interest\n[01:11:12] in the past there an interest in our\n[01:11:14] personal past our personal Origins our\n[01:11:16] ancestors who we are and there's a much\n[01:11:18] broader interest in the story of\n[01:11:20] humanity that has brought us to where we\n[01:11:22] are today and this haunting feeling that\n[01:11:25] something's missing and that we that we\n[01:11:28] have a we have a civilization today I I\n[01:11:31] often comp would like to compare it to a\n[01:11:35] a sort of furious in terms of the level\n[01:11:37] of Consciousness our civilization today\n[01:11:40] is like a furious petulent teenager but\n[01:11:43] in terms of what it can do in terms of\n[01:11:45] the destructive power of nuclear weapons\n[01:11:48] it's a God so we have Godlike Powers\n[01:11:51] with the consciousness of an immature\n[01:11:53] teenager that's what we're looking at in\n[01:11:55] the world today and maybe by\n[01:11:58] understanding our past better by\n[01:12:00] understanding our Unity that comes down\n[01:12:02] from the past maybe we can learn\n[01:12:04] something that would be helpful to us in\n[01:12:05] not carrying on in this way because we\n[01:12:07] do live at an inflection point just now\n[01:12:10] this is one thing I'm pretty sure that\n[01:12:13] quote unquote my Lost Civilization\n[01:12:15] didn't have and that was nuclear weapons\n[01:12:17] but we have nukes today and we have them\n[01:12:19] in in an enormous scale and behind each\n[01:12:22] of those nukes is a fragile human being\n[01:12:25] with his own or her own ego and\n[01:12:27] complexes and fears and paranoia uh and\n[01:12:31] and we're reaching a point where those\n[01:12:32] buttons are going to be pressed we are\n[01:12:35] as far as I know the first human\n[01:12:37] civilization that uh has the capacity to\n[01:12:40] actually wipe itself out completely we\n[01:12:42] don't need a comet impact we don't need\n[01:12:44] a solar Outburst we can do it to\n[01:12:47] ourselves and that requires Humanity to\n[01:12:50] make a major step forward in\n[01:12:51] Consciousness and I think making that\n[01:12:53] major step forward in consciousness will\n[01:12:55] be helped by better understanding our\n[01:12:57] own past I I agree I I mean it's just\n[01:13:01] disturbing how many times we can travel\n[01:13:03] to ancient places like Greece or any any\n[01:13:07] place where you go to Rome and realize\n[01:13:09] oh there's a thriving civilization here\n[01:13:10] at one point and you were in Greece\n[01:13:12] recently yeah with Brian you with Brian\n[01:13:15] meski guy brilliant guy but it uh what a\n[01:13:19] treat is to have a tour of the Parthenon\n[01:13:21] the Acropolis with him yeah and you know\n[01:13:23] we went to uh to see the side of the\n[01:13:26] ucini Mysteries and all that it was very\n[01:13:29] very very interesting but just also\n[01:13:31] sobering because you realized like this\n[01:13:34] civilization did not make it you know\n[01:13:36] this this insane fascinating complex\n[01:13:40] civilization crumbled yeah and the idea\n[01:13:43] that ours can't is one that we kind of\n[01:13:45] hold dear like we're different we got it\n[01:13:47] figur it out we're better but there's so\n[01:13:49] much evidence that that's just a normal\n[01:13:51] pattern of human history civilization's\n[01:13:53] come and go yeah we could be gone in 20\n[01:13:55] years yeah I'd love to take you on a\n[01:13:58] trip to Egypt at I want to go I want to\n[01:14:01] go I'll tell you about an an idea that\n[01:14:04] was brought to me uh after the show I\n[01:14:06] can't talk about it now yeah I'll tell\n[01:14:08] you I've made friends with sahi hawas I\n[01:14:11] heard he's a very you guys are homies\n[01:14:13] now yeah we're homies we had we had a\n[01:14:14] nice dinner together and it's partly\n[01:14:18] because who needs more enemies and\n[01:14:21] hatred in this world and and I I said\n[01:14:24] some very cruel harsh things to zahi in\n[01:14:26] the past and I felt I felt the time had\n[01:14:28] come to apologize for those so I went to\n[01:14:30] Egypt to apologize to him really and we\n[01:14:32] had a fantastic dinner together his son\n[01:14:33] joined us Santa was there it was very\n[01:14:36] friendly and very positive and I love\n[01:14:38] stories like that and you know we've\n[01:14:39] agreed that we will if by chance we get\n[01:14:42] a season three of ancient apocalypse\n[01:14:45] which we may or may not get um I'm not\n[01:14:48] in control of commissioning decisions at\n[01:14:50] at Netflix but if we get a season 3 of\n[01:14:51] ancient apocalypse I would like it to be\n[01:14:54] entirely on Egypt\n[01:14:55] and and and what I would like is for zah\n[01:14:58] to confront me on every Point as we go\n[01:15:01] through\n[01:15:02] Egypt whatever one says about zah\n[01:15:04] explosive personality he's been immersed\n[01:15:07] in ancient Egyptian egyptology for his\n[01:15:10] whole life and he has very strong points\n[01:15:12] of view on it and he's a fun guy in some\n[01:15:14] ways um you know I'd imagine that as\n[01:15:17] people get older and wiser and realize\n[01:15:19] the Folly of their ways particular in\n[01:15:21] their youth maybe he would be more open\n[01:15:23] to the idea that the civilization is\n[01:15:26] just the this civilization same\n[01:15:28] civilization but older than you think it\n[01:15:30] is yeah I'm I'm I'm hoping to persuade\n[01:15:32] him of of that I think it'll be an\n[01:15:34] interesting dialogue if we get if we get\n[01:15:35] to have it I think people for a long\n[01:15:38] time uh had this concept in their mind\n[01:15:41] that changing the dates somehow negates\n[01:15:44] the accomplishment of the people that\n[01:15:46] lived in the prescribed date yeah you\n[01:15:49] know the somehow or another uh the\n[01:15:51] pushing it back yes the pushing it back\n[01:15:53] somehow or another even they'll even say\n[01:15:55] it's racist this is a propag this is\n[01:15:58] propaganda this is this is\n[01:15:59] archaeological propaganda for for that's\n[01:16:01] been said to me repeatedly that I'm\n[01:16:03] suggesting that um all the achievements\n[01:16:05] of certain indigenous cultures around\n[01:16:06] the world should actually be handed to\n[01:16:09] to A Lost Civilization that ideas were\n[01:16:11] brought to them yet weirdly those same\n[01:16:13] archaeologists recognize that\n[01:16:15] agriculture was introduced to Europe by\n[01:16:18] immigrants from precisely the gockley\n[01:16:21] tee area that's that's where agriculture\n[01:16:24] wasn't present in Europe until 5 or 6\n[01:16:26] thousand years ago it was brought in by\n[01:16:27] other people people this is part of the\n[01:16:29] human nature that we share ideas\n[01:16:32] somebody has a great idea we look at\n[01:16:33] that we think we'd like a bit of that\n[01:16:35] too teach me how to do it uh and this\n[01:16:37] happen this happens all the time and it\n[01:16:39] doesn't mean that the person who's being\n[01:16:40] taught is any less than the person who's\n[01:16:42] doing the teaching the person who's\n[01:16:44] being taught may have things to teach\n[01:16:46] themselves um I've always felt that\n[01:16:48] there were if there was A Lost\n[01:16:50] Civilization at all and I believe there\n[01:16:52] was but I can't absolutely prove it\n[01:16:55] I think we're looking at a terrible\n[01:16:57] cataclysm part of it happened near\n[01:17:00] gocke Abu Herrera in Syria was was hit\n[01:17:03] by one of those Air Bursts absolutely\n[01:17:06] incinerated at at at that at that time\n[01:17:09] um a terrible cataclysm uh with\n[01:17:12] relatively few survivors uh and that\n[01:17:14] those survivors just as we would do\n[01:17:16] today took Refuge amongst people who'd\n[01:17:19] made it through the disaster better and\n[01:17:21] those Refuge those those people who'd\n[01:17:24] made it through would most likely have\n[01:17:25] been hunter gatherers uh because hunter\n[01:17:28] gatherers are so resilient and so able\n[01:17:30] to survive disasters whereas whereas\n[01:17:32] people in a quote unquote civilized\n[01:17:34] condition are often are often not I mean\n[01:17:36] you know we can see relative I\n[01:17:39] understand that the Hurricanes that are\n[01:17:40] happening in the US at the moment are\n[01:17:42] horrific horrific natural events which\n[01:17:44] are which which are killing people but\n[01:17:46] we're talking about something on a scale\n[01:17:48] vastly larger than that and it's\n[01:17:51] difficult for me to see we find it hard\n[01:17:52] enough to make it through a hurricane I\n[01:17:54] find it difficult to see how we could\n[01:17:56] make it through another younger Drass\n[01:17:58] impact event or how we could make it\n[01:18:00] through a man-made cataclysm as a result\n[01:18:03] of nuclear war which is I suspect and I\n[01:18:06] fear is much closer than we think I I I\n[01:18:10] hate the idea that nuclear missiles may\n[01:18:12] be flying in my lifetime or the lifetime\n[01:18:14] of my children but I have to say\n[01:18:16] honestly it's a possibility with the\n[01:18:18] state of the world at the moment and the\n[01:18:19] low state of consciousness of the people\n[01:18:21] who lead us the leaders and governments\n[01:18:24] are behind this it's not it's not human\n[01:18:26] beings individual people who are behind\n[01:18:28] this hatred in the world today it's\n[01:18:30] leaders and governments who are\n[01:18:31] mobilizing that hatred to serve their\n[01:18:33] own interests uh and it's very dangerous\n[01:18:36] if if we didn't have nukes it would be\n[01:18:37] less dangerous but yeah I I agree with\n[01:18:39] you um when you're talking about gockley\n[01:18:41] tee one of the things that uh Jimmy\n[01:18:44] corsetti has talked about recently in\n[01:18:45] his YouTube show is that there they have\n[01:18:49] stopped\n[01:18:50] excavation and they've planted trees\n[01:18:53] above some of the areas which is very\n[01:18:56] strange it is and they they want the\n[01:18:59] excavation to resume in 150 years yes so\n[01:19:03] what would be a logical reason to not\n[01:19:07] excavate these fascinating ancient sites\n[01:19:11] that are at least 11,000 years old\n[01:19:13] generally with any archaeological site\n[01:19:15] they don't excavate more than 5% of it\n[01:19:17] and often less than 2% of it is that\n[01:19:20] because of funds it's often because of\n[01:19:22] funds but it's also because of the\n[01:19:23] feeling that as technology improves uh\n[01:19:27] more may be learned from these sites in\n[01:19:29] the future and and that's a reasonable\n[01:19:31] argument uh because excavation is\n[01:19:33] destruction to a certain extent\n[01:19:35] excavation destroys what's being\n[01:19:37] excavated um and therefore when you\n[01:19:40] interfere with a site and start\n[01:19:41] Excavating it you may be destroying\n[01:19:44] materials that in a 100 years technology\n[01:19:47] would be able to interpret in a\n[01:19:49] completely different way I mean 100 year\n[01:19:50] go back a 100 years from where we are at\n[01:19:53] present and you didn't have carbon\n[01:19:55] dating you didn't have liar you didn't\n[01:19:57] have uh all kinds of methods of of of of\n[01:20:02] dating objects you know luminescence the\n[01:20:06] the luminescence from rocks is another\n[01:20:07] way of dat we didn't have any of those\n[01:20:08] Technologies we do have them now and so\n[01:20:10] I think the speculation is 100 years in\n[01:20:12] the future archaeologists have may techn\n[01:20:14] may have technologies that would be able\n[01:20:16] to extract more information than this\n[01:20:18] that's the case that's made I get it but\n[01:20:21] I think gocke is such an important site\n[01:20:24] and we know know I know for sure because\n[01:20:26] I spent three days with CLA Smidt who\n[01:20:28] was the original excavator of gocke that\n[01:20:32] underneath that place there there are\n[01:20:35] dozens of huge unexcavated Stone circles\n[01:20:38] with enormous megalithic pillars in them\n[01:20:41] all under the ground waiting to be\n[01:20:43] excavated and the decision appears to\n[01:20:45] have been made not to excavate them and\n[01:20:47] I do find that slightly suspicious I do\n[01:20:49] find it I do find it odd I think the\n[01:20:51] site has got such an important role Ro\n[01:20:54] it's such an iconic site that to just\n[01:20:57] stop the excavation uh or to only\n[01:21:00] continue it in a very small way uh isn't\n[01:21:03] satisfactory to when you say suspicious\n[01:21:05] like what would be the motivation for\n[01:21:09] discontinuing that kind of excavation\n[01:21:11] other than the fear of destroying\n[01:21:14] things\n[01:21:16] um I don't want I don't want to be a\n[01:21:20] conspiracy theorist please do Jump Right\n[01:21:22] In but but there is a there there is\n[01:21:25] there is an issue here\n[01:21:28] um I've noticed that it isn't just\n[01:21:31] attacks on me that that certain\n[01:21:33] archaeologists are making it's also\n[01:21:36] attacks on other Specialists for example\n[01:21:39] Danny Hillman nataja who is the\n[01:21:42] geologist who um brought to the world's\n[01:21:45] attention the mystery of Gung Padang in\n[01:21:48] Indonesia which appeared in the first\n[01:21:50] episode of season 1 of ancient\n[01:21:52] apocalypse uh the possibility that this\n[01:21:54] site is more than\n[01:21:56] 27,000 years old uh that we're looking\n[01:21:59] at a pyramidal structure that that has\n[01:22:01] had several phases of work done on it\n[01:22:03] and that the earliest phases go back\n[01:22:05] deep into the last ice age he managed to\n[01:22:08] publish a peer-reviewed paper on this\n[01:22:10] but unfortunately for Dany he'd appeared\n[01:22:13] on my show and that led archaeologists\n[01:22:16] to dive in on him and there was a\n[01:22:18] ganging up of archaeologists and\n[01:22:19] complaints were made to the peer- review\n[01:22:22] journal that published it and finally\n[01:22:23] they retracted they retracted his paper\n[01:22:25] without any good reasons I've I've got a\n[01:22:28] major article by Danny on my website\n[01:22:29] explaining what what happened here it's\n[01:22:31] like it's like we don't want too much\n[01:22:34] attention brought to this let's crush it\n[01:22:37] let's crush it right now the same thing\n[01:22:38] is happening with the younger dras\n[01:22:40] impact hypothesis an enormous amount of\n[01:22:43] attacks are being made on that\n[01:22:44] hypothesis rather than considering it as\n[01:22:46] a as an interesting explanation for the\n[01:22:48] cataclysms at the end of the Ice Age a\n[01:22:49] lot of a lot of people are just focused\n[01:22:51] on trying to destroy it in in every way\n[01:22:53] possible is and I can't help wondering\n[01:22:56] maybe there's some truth deep Truth uh\n[01:22:59] to this that there was a cataclysm that\n[01:23:01] there was an ancient apocalypse\n[01:23:03] something really horrific that happened\n[01:23:05] maybe it's a cyclical disaster maybe\n[01:23:07] it's coming round again this is this is\n[01:23:10] something that would would lead any\n[01:23:12] government uh to want to avoid Panic uh\n[01:23:15] to to suppress to cover up these these\n[01:23:17] issues so that would be the conspiracy\n[01:23:19] theory on it I'm not saying I buy it but\n[01:23:20] I'm saying that it is possible would\n[01:23:22] also a conspiracy be that they\n[01:23:25] recognized that some of the area around\n[01:23:27] gockley tee was older still and they\n[01:23:30] decided just the archaeologist didn't\n[01:23:32] want to confront it and they put a stop\n[01:23:34] to it that's also possible that's also\n[01:23:36] possible but in in their favor and to\n[01:23:39] their credit uh the excavation of that\n[01:23:43] whole area around not GOC teepe itself\n[01:23:46] but other neighboring sites karahan\n[01:23:47] teepe is the best known Turkish\n[01:23:50] archaeologists it's interesting are\n[01:23:52] calling this now a civilization they're\n[01:23:53] calling it The cast civilization the\n[01:23:56] Stone Hills civilization and they're\n[01:23:58] finding that the same iconography the\n[01:24:00] same building techniques not quite on\n[01:24:02] the scale of Quebec Lee are repeated all\n[01:24:04] across the region they extend all the\n[01:24:06] way down to the south of the Jordan\n[01:24:07] Valley to Jericho the ancient site of\n[01:24:10] Jericho is part of that lost or emerging\n[01:24:13] civilization that appeared at the end of\n[01:24:15] the of the younger drer Cyprus is\n[01:24:18] another example I was mentioning about\n[01:24:19] how it was settled in what appear to\n[01:24:21] have been planned organized settlement\n[01:24:24] event\n[01:24:25] near the end of the last ice age again\n[01:24:27] you find that same iconography that you\n[01:24:28] find at GOC Tey turning up there which\n[01:24:30] iconography specifically the the\n[01:24:32] tendency to to use t-shaped pillars uh\n[01:24:36] to to use certain designs like a\n[01:24:39] v-shaped uh necklace the this this kind\n[01:24:42] of iconography and and the structures\n[01:24:44] these circular structures semi semi\n[01:24:47] Subterranean structures that are so\n[01:24:49] characteristic of goley they're found\n[01:24:51] they're found there as well they're\n[01:24:51] found all across the region Jericho in\n[01:24:54] the the Jordan Valley is absolutely\n[01:24:56] intriguing the massive Tower there which\n[01:24:59] again dates back right to the end of the\n[01:25:00] last ice age a huge megalithic Tower\n[01:25:02] with the world's oldest known megalithic\n[01:25:05] stairway that runs up that runs up\n[01:25:07] inside it so what's emerging as a result\n[01:25:10] if goly tee hadn't been found none of\n[01:25:11] this would have happened but it's led to\n[01:25:14] a widespread interest in the whole area\n[01:25:17] so while excavation may have stopped at\n[01:25:19] gbec Le tee or may have slowed down it\n[01:25:21] is continuing elsewhere uh across the\n[01:25:24] region and to be fair to archaeologists\n[01:25:25] we need to recognize that is the size\n[01:25:28] and scale of gockley tee unique in\n[01:25:30] comparison to the ones that are around\n[01:25:32] it yes so far the ones that have been\n[01:25:34] found GC tee is unique and and I and I\n[01:25:37] think it's it's clear now that GC tee\n[01:25:40] itself was the end of a process not the\n[01:25:42] beginning of a process it was it was\n[01:25:44] something that marked it was a marker it\n[01:25:46] was something that brought together the\n[01:25:48] best of everything that they'd\n[01:25:49] accumulated and and created it in one\n[01:25:52] place uh and and\n[01:25:54] left it there finally at the end burying\n[01:25:57] it sealing it as a time capsule which\n[01:25:59] then was untouched for more than 10,000\n[01:26:02] years before CLA Schmidt opened it up in\n[01:26:05] 1996 um it's it's I can't help feeling\n[01:26:08] that's precisely what gobec Tey is it's\n[01:26:10] a it's a time capsule it's a memorial to\n[01:26:13] a lost time um and and I think that what\n[01:26:17] we're looking at in that whole area is\n[01:26:20] the outcome of contact with an\n[01:26:25] largely Lost Civilization I think it\n[01:26:26] passed on its cultural genes right there\n[01:26:30] in that in that area of turkey and down\n[01:26:32] into the Jordan Valley and Cyprus and\n[01:26:34] and they not only there also the indis\n[01:26:36] valley civilization it's incredible\n[01:26:38] iconography uh which shows um a man\n[01:26:41] between two\n[01:26:42] felines uh it's it's very striking image\n[01:26:44] you see a man and and two tigers or\n[01:26:47] leopards on either side of him and he\n[01:26:49] may be holding them apart he may be\n[01:26:50] gripping them in some way what is this\n[01:26:52] so Jamie could find it um you you can\n[01:26:54] find it on um the galal arak knife\n[01:26:58] handle from uh Egypt um you can find it\n[01:27:02] from sabok s a y b r k uh in um turkey\n[01:27:08] the man between two SE two Felines and\n[01:27:11] you can find it in the indis valley\n[01:27:12] civilization right across in Pakistan on\n[01:27:15] these steti seals that they used to make\n[01:27:18] where again you see that same icon of\n[01:27:19] the man between two felines um and it\n[01:27:22] suggests that cultural ideas way back in\n[01:27:25] the remote past were being spread around\n[01:27:27] the world very very rapidly found\n[01:27:30] anything there\n[01:27:32] Jamie I can I can tell you the so how\n[01:27:35] much of that area where gockley tape has\n[01:27:37] been searched with liar here it is\n[01:27:41] here's the images look at that wow yeah\n[01:27:42] that's there we are that's that's haraa\n[01:27:44] that's from the indis valley\n[01:27:45] civilization man man between two felines\n[01:27:48] um what do you think that supposedly\n[01:27:50] represents nobody knows what it\n[01:27:52] represents but what's intriguing is that\n[01:27:53] it turn up in so many different places\n[01:27:56] um but I'd like to find the S just give\n[01:27:58] me one second just to find to find\n[01:28:01] something I hope I'm online here I am um\n[01:28:04] how many of the uh areas have been\n[01:28:08] searched with lar um hang on Joe bear\n[01:28:11] with me just worries worries one minute\n[01:28:13] this is where I have to take my bloody\n[01:28:14] glasses off you got to go back and forth\n[01:28:16] yeah um you looked at that show that\n[01:28:19] Karen Tey has some cool stuff that I\n[01:28:20] don't think we've seen before there's\n[01:28:22] this huge skeletal figure this this one\n[01:28:25] 12 ft high or something like that\n[01:28:27] extraord kind of similar to the Easter\n[01:28:29] Island heads what's going on down there\n[01:28:32] is\n[01:28:34] hog you think it is how weird are those\n[01:28:39] structures you know about like the way\n[01:28:41] their hands are placed it's kind of\n[01:28:42] similar to the way the Easter Island\n[01:28:44] hands are placed Jamie could I could I\n[01:28:45] get plugged into the H HDMI uh sure do\n[01:28:50] you need to uh yeah okay pause please\n[01:28:53] we'll pause we'll be right back good all\n[01:28:56] right we're back we're back okay we\n[01:28:58] found these images from so so this is\n[01:29:00] from Jamie maybe you could expand that\n[01:29:02] uh the cybook relief I think you have to\n[01:29:04] do it okay it's on my yeah there we go\n[01:29:08] so so this is this is about 10,000 years\n[01:29:10] old it's from a site in the area of\n[01:29:13] gocke uh called saor uh and it's gone\n[01:29:17] one\n[01:29:18] second here it is and and it's a it's\n[01:29:21] clearly a man between two F lines and\n[01:29:23] interesting he's holding his dick uh\n[01:29:26] exactly like that piece that you just\n[01:29:28] showed from\n[01:29:29] Kari um and then if we go on\n[01:29:38] um I don't understand what I'm doing\n[01:29:40] with this thing there it is so then the\n[01:29:43] indis again yeah I'm controlling what's\n[01:29:46] on the screen you are okay so there's\n[01:29:48] the man between two felines again expand\n[01:29:51] that so that particular image is there\n[01:29:54] any sort of a theory as to what they\n[01:29:55] were trying that what that represented\n[01:29:58] uh human Mastery of animals is the only\n[01:30:00] one I've heard uh that's being suggested\n[01:30:03] um but it seems like they they're trying\n[01:30:05] to get him it does in that in that case\n[01:30:08] uh rather than or or that he's holding\n[01:30:10] them he's holding them at Bay keeping\n[01:30:11] them from getting each other yeah and\n[01:30:13] then if you go down to the Egyptian one\n[01:30:15] which is the gble Alaric knife handle\n[01:30:17] there it is that's from ancient Egypt\n[01:30:19] predynastic Egypt same thing wow and\n[01:30:22] then the next one is from tiwanak in\n[01:30:24] Bolivia um that's a redrawing uh from\n[01:30:27] from tanako in Bolivia and again it's a\n[01:30:29] man between two felines wow so when I\n[01:30:32] see this kind of complicated image\n[01:30:34] turning up all around the world I can't\n[01:30:36] help feeling that there's a remote\n[01:30:37] common source which is sharing it's not\n[01:30:39] each culture representing or influencing\n[01:30:41] the other it's a remote common source\n[01:30:43] that they all share what's the last one\n[01:30:45] from from where's it from again from\n[01:30:47] tiako in Bolivia look what what do you\n[01:30:49] think he's got in his\n[01:30:51] hands well it looks like two felines is\n[01:30:54] holding apart too right but what are\n[01:30:55] those things that are dangling down I\n[01:30:58] absolutely have no idea and I'm not sure\n[01:31:00] if anybody else does although I'm\n[01:31:01] reminded in that one of the handbags\n[01:31:03] that we that we see in some of the\n[01:31:05] figures from ancient Sumer right but\n[01:31:07] what is the thing on the left again I\n[01:31:10] don't know and I don't think anybody\n[01:31:11] does very what are there why does he\n[01:31:13] have steps on his chest and a and a\n[01:31:15] wheel like what is that you know what is\n[01:31:19] that what is that spiral in the center\n[01:31:21] of his body it's a spiral of mystery I\n[01:31:23] honly don't know the answer to that\n[01:31:25] question because like look it's a\n[01:31:26] there's a geometric pattern and it goes\n[01:31:29] up and down with the steps and it\n[01:31:30] repeats on both Corners that one where\n[01:31:33] it steps up and and the other side where\n[01:31:35] it steps down yeah very strange it would\n[01:31:37] be nice if there were written records\n[01:31:39] from from tanako told what it was about\n[01:31:41] but unfortunately there aren't just um\n[01:31:44] very very bizarre so what I'm saying is\n[01:31:47] we're we're seeing a a sudden emergence\n[01:31:49] of something that is being recognized as\n[01:31:50] a civilization in Turkey just\n[01:31:53] immediately after gockley tee around the\n[01:31:55] time of gockley tee and we're seeing it\n[01:31:57] in the Jordan Valley and we're seeing it\n[01:31:59] in the indis valley and we're seeing it\n[01:32:01] in South America as well um the same\n[01:32:04] iconography keeps on repeating and I\n[01:32:06] don't think it's a coincidence the area\n[01:32:08] where thech are have there ever been\n[01:32:13] liar excavations or I wouldn't be\n[01:32:16] surprised if there have vosa the sort of\n[01:32:19] central of the alch area is very highly\n[01:32:22] populated area it's been heavily\n[01:32:24] developed the areas where Li lier has\n[01:32:25] been used in Mexico and Central America\n[01:32:28] in Guatemala uh has has has been finding\n[01:32:32] thousands of Mayan ruins that nobody\n[01:32:34] knew were there before again under under\n[01:32:36] the jungle canopy lier has been used\n[01:32:39] extensively uh in the Yucatan in Mexico\n[01:32:42] and into Guatemala as as well but\n[01:32:44] whether it's been used there we are look\n[01:32:46] at that hundreds of and all ceremonial\n[01:32:48] centers yeah wow yeah this is all thank\n[01:32:51] you liar you know so crazy that that\n[01:32:54] stuff was there all along and nobody\n[01:32:55] knew and nobody knew yeah and and and of\n[01:32:58] course the Amazon rainforest is an even\n[01:33:01] bigger rainforest than this and what's\n[01:33:03] hiding in it right is a a mystery that\n[01:33:07] needs to be solved in the coming years\n[01:33:09] right if we're going to have any idea of\n[01:33:12] our own past I think the Amazon's\n[01:33:14] incredibly important it's it's why I I\n[01:33:17] chose to focus season 2 of ancient\n[01:33:19] apocalypse on the Americas because I\n[01:33:21] think in terms of the Quest for the\n[01:33:23] origins of civilization the Americas are\n[01:33:25] the most neglected area archaeologists\n[01:33:27] haven't looked there theyve they they\n[01:33:30] Define themselves as being in favor of\n[01:33:32] indigenous peoples and against any kind\n[01:33:34] of Supremacy but by and large they look\n[01:33:36] to Europe and and to the Middle East as\n[01:33:38] the origins of civilization and don't\n[01:33:40] consider that it might have been in the\n[01:33:42] Americas and what we're trying to show\n[01:33:43] is that the story in the Americas is\n[01:33:45] much older than it's been and that there\n[01:33:47] are Mysteries here that have never been\n[01:33:49] explained by archaeology how much of the\n[01:33:52] Amazon has been explored with liar\n[01:33:54] a very tiny proportion I I worked with\n[01:33:56] the team who are who are doing this and\n[01:33:58] they're solely in the province of arra\n[01:34:01] uh in the southwest of Brazil they\n[01:34:03] haven't worked in other areas what would\n[01:34:05] be needed and I'm hoping some amazing\n[01:34:07] philanthropist will come forward and if\n[01:34:10] such a philanthropist will come forward\n[01:34:11] I can connect him with the people who\n[01:34:13] are doing the work in Acra uh that we\n[01:34:15] have a lied our survey of the whole of\n[01:34:16] the Amazon that's what I'd like to see\n[01:34:19] and it wouldn't be a billion dollar\n[01:34:21] project because it can be done with\n[01:34:22] drones now it could be it it could be\n[01:34:24] relatively cost efficient that would be\n[01:34:27] incredible just imagine what's out there\n[01:34:30] yeah and that's that and we have the\n[01:34:32] tech we can do that we can do a liar\n[01:34:34] survey of the Amazon where specifically\n[01:34:36] did they think that lost city of Z was\n[01:34:38] and did they try to explore that I think\n[01:34:40] it was in Ecuador or Colombia I can't I\n[01:34:42] can't remember that was pery forcet\n[01:34:44] wasn't it um and kind of\n[01:34:48] uh echo of that earlier discovery of\n[01:34:51] lost cities in the Amazon these Stories\n[01:34:54] won't go away because there is a hidden\n[01:34:56] past in the Amazon and because there\n[01:34:58] were cities in the Amazon and God knows\n[01:35:00] what was in them you know before the\n[01:35:03] Spanish came along and destroyed\n[01:35:06] everything God it seems like that has to\n[01:35:07] be discovered I mean that has to be\n[01:35:08] looked at just specifically if we could\n[01:35:12] just find that the lost city of Z was a\n[01:35:14] real\n[01:35:16] place if we could find it was a real\n[01:35:18] place yeah uh I wish we could I mean\n[01:35:20] just finding lost city of Z's Alle on\n[01:35:23] rainforest and British Explorer Percy\n[01:35:25] Harrison fet look M Gro in Brazil yeah\n[01:35:30] theorized that the city was a refuge of\n[01:35:31] people fleeing the destruction of\n[01:35:33] Atlantis whoa that its wisdom could\n[01:35:35] still be found there wow yeah wow I\n[01:35:40] think we're going to find the lost city\n[01:35:42] of X and Y as well I bet and W maybe ABC\n[01:35:45] D and possibly ABC and D too maybe a\n[01:35:48] bunch yeah it's um at the very least\n[01:35:52] it's CLE clear that not enough is known\n[01:35:55] yeah not not not enough is known and and\n[01:35:59] I think it's right and proper that we\n[01:36:01] have curiosity about our past uh and I\n[01:36:04] think it's un it's unfortunate that that\n[01:36:07] people including myself who who Express\n[01:36:09] that Curiosity without any Dogma but\n[01:36:12] simply are mystified by problems from\n[01:36:15] the past are so likely to get slapped\n[01:36:17] down and face this uh abusive power grab\n[01:36:21] by by archaeology who are saying the\n[01:36:23] past is ours you may not intrude here uh\n[01:36:26] we will Define you as a pseudoscientist\n[01:36:28] we will call you a hoaxer and a liar I\n[01:36:31] defy anyone out there to find a single\n[01:36:33] statement I've made that is a lie and a\n[01:36:36] lie is uh a knowing untruth yes as far\n[01:36:40] as I know I have never ever told\n[01:36:43] knowingly an untruth what a stupid thing\n[01:36:46] to do that would be that would Scupper\n[01:36:48] my whole work I may have made some\n[01:36:51] honest mistakes everybody does including\n[01:36:54] the most Godlike archaeologist but I\n[01:36:56] have never knowingly told an untruth and\n[01:36:58] I never would of course not the um the\n[01:37:01] the interesting thing though is I but\n[01:37:03] seriously I'd like an example because\n[01:37:04] this has thrown at me so many times you\n[01:37:06] can't be responding to the haters all\n[01:37:08] the time it's bad but they include\n[01:37:09] oologist I know but the reality is most\n[01:37:11] people aren't listening anymore Define\n[01:37:13] the untruth I don't think that's working\n[01:37:15] anymore because I think enough people\n[01:37:16] have seen your work and enough people\n[01:37:17] have heard you talk and they know that\n[01:37:18] you're reasonable and intelligent and\n[01:37:20] that there's something there and the\n[01:37:22] more people look at these images the\n[01:37:23] more people hear people like Flint just\n[01:37:26] out andout lie to try to dismiss these\n[01:37:29] things it was most unfortunate I think\n[01:37:30] he I think he let archaeology down very\n[01:37:32] badly in the way that he manipulated\n[01:37:35] that debate uh and and I'm sorry it's\n[01:37:37] taken me so long to to to come back with\n[01:37:40] the with the factchecking but it was it\n[01:37:42] was necessary to do and I I I I'm very\n[01:37:44] grateful to a number of completely\n[01:37:46] independent separate individuals on the\n[01:37:48] internet who who have drawn attention to\n[01:37:50] some of what uh Flint Flint did yeah one\n[01:37:54] calls himself illegitimate scholar and\n[01:37:56] the other calls himself dunking and and\n[01:37:59] they got into this material very very\n[01:38:00] early and helped me to understand how\n[01:38:02] I'd been duped by this material cuz I\n[01:38:05] took it I took it all at face value at\n[01:38:07] the time well that's the beautiful thing\n[01:38:08] about the internet yeah you know there's\n[01:38:10] uh there's a lot of people out there\n[01:38:11] that are very invested in these ideas\n[01:38:13] and exploring them and they also find it\n[01:38:16] very uncomfortable that they're being\n[01:38:18] confronted by\n[01:38:20] these Scholars these people that are\n[01:38:22] supposed to be the ones that are the\n[01:38:25] experts in this area that are dismissing\n[01:38:27] things that shouldn't be dismissed that\n[01:38:29] are lying about statistics just just try\n[01:38:31] to diffuse your argument yeah and\n[01:38:33] there's also that feeling of being just\n[01:38:34] being patronized by the so-called\n[01:38:36] experts nobody wants to be patronized\n[01:38:39] and and and feel that somebody else\n[01:38:40] regards them as too stupid to make up\n[01:38:42] their own mind on something right and\n[01:38:43] they think that somehow or another that\n[01:38:45] exploring these ideas dismisses the\n[01:38:47] legitimate work that archaeologists have\n[01:38:49] already done which I don't think it does\n[01:38:50] at all not at all archaeologists have\n[01:38:52] done some fantastic work\n[01:38:55] what I've realized that there's almost\n[01:38:57] two different mindsets at work here in\n[01:38:59] looking at the P I think Archaeology is\n[01:39:02] very determined to demonstrate that it's\n[01:39:05] a science that it's a hard science that\n[01:39:07] it's completely rational that it's all\n[01:39:09] based on scientific method and and and\n[01:39:12] anything that sounds unscientific which\n[01:39:14] include myths uh must be must be avoided\n[01:39:18] um and also I do find that archaeology\n[01:39:21] and it may be true in other Sciences as\n[01:39:23] well well very reluctant to use the\n[01:39:25] imagination the imagination is seen as a\n[01:39:28] as a deadly threat uh whereas I think\n[01:39:30] the imagination is really important\n[01:39:31] thing in interpreting the past we we we\n[01:39:33] should be open to possibilities rather\n[01:39:36] than coming into what we confront with a\n[01:39:38] closed idea uh we should consider how it\n[01:39:40] might have been what might have happened\n[01:39:42] let's use our imagination and think\n[01:39:43] about this think what all this means\n[01:39:45] think what that common iconography all\n[01:39:47] around the world means rather than just\n[01:39:49] saying oh it's a coincidence well in\n[01:39:50] some places that's your only option like\n[01:39:52] the culture where like we don't know\n[01:39:54] well we we have these faces that don't\n[01:39:56] look like yeah I mean it's it's it's\n[01:39:59] confusing they look like maybe they're\n[01:40:01] from Polynesia maybe they're from Africa\n[01:40:03] could be Polynesia could be could be\n[01:40:05] could be Africa um and and and then\n[01:40:08] there are these other faces which I in\n[01:40:11] the video I've I've put out I've shown\n[01:40:13] some of these it's not just myths of a\n[01:40:16] bearded Foreigner turning up uh in in\n[01:40:19] the Americas which flint dible and other\n[01:40:22] archaeologists say\n[01:40:23] were all concocted and invented by the\n[01:40:26] the Spaniard we discussed that during\n[01:40:27] the debate I have I have a real problem\n[01:40:29] with that because that is patronizing to\n[01:40:30] the indigenous people I think the myths\n[01:40:33] were there amongst the indigenous people\n[01:40:35] and I think the Spaniards saw how they\n[01:40:37] could use them how they could manipulate\n[01:40:39] them but I don't think they made up the\n[01:40:40] myths and somehow imposed them upon the\n[01:40:42] indigenous people who then believed that\n[01:40:44] they were their own myths uh I don't\n[01:40:47] think they were that stupid they knew\n[01:40:48] what their myths were well my my concern\n[01:40:50] with that line of thinking is that we\n[01:40:53] seen evidence of that sort of\n[01:40:55] destruction of the real history of\n[01:40:56] people in America with how they forced\n[01:40:59] Native Americans onto reservations and\n[01:41:01] spoke forced them into speaking English\n[01:41:04] and forced them into learning\n[01:41:05] Christianity that we there was a\n[01:41:07] concerted effort to erase their history\n[01:41:09] and their culture and that the\n[01:41:12] conquerors imposed that on the people\n[01:41:14] that were there but this is a this is a\n[01:41:17] kind of conspiracy theory that's being\n[01:41:19] proposed that the Spanish Cortez and\n[01:41:22] pizaro and others who were in involved\n[01:41:23] in the conquest of the Americas that\n[01:41:25] they got together and they created a\n[01:41:28] fiction and then they made the\n[01:41:30] indigenous people believe that fiction\n[01:41:32] while accepting everything else that the\n[01:41:34] indigenous people beli that was a\n[01:41:36] fiction there's no document which says\n[01:41:38] that Spaniards conspired to create these\n[01:41:41] stories I I believe that when we find\n[01:41:43] them in Mexico when we find them in Peru\n[01:41:46] when we find them in Colombia when we\n[01:41:47] find them in Bolivia we are looking at\n[01:41:50] indigenous traditions and I have no\n[01:41:52] doubt that the Spanish saw those\n[01:41:54] traditions and said we can use this we\n[01:41:55] can take advantage of this we can\n[01:41:57] exploit this but I don't think they made\n[01:41:58] up the Traditions so it's possibly a\n[01:42:01] myth of people that came over on ships\n[01:42:04] that look different yeah yeah it's about\n[01:42:06] that that's about what it comes to when\n[01:42:08] you when you hear about things like the\n[01:42:10] lost city of Z when you hear about all\n[01:42:12] the different times where European\n[01:42:13] explorers did make it to the Americas\n[01:42:16] and spread their disease is like well\n[01:42:17] you're going to miss from those folks\n[01:42:19] too so who's to think that there wasn't\n[01:42:21] multiple versions of that happened all\n[01:42:24] throughout history yeah I suspect if it\n[01:42:26] happened in the 1400s it probably\n[01:42:27] happened a long long time ago as well\n[01:42:30] yeah the whole thing is so interesting\n[01:42:33] and it never ends and every now and\n[01:42:36] again a new discovery comes along that\n[01:42:38] pushes back the date of humans in\n[01:42:41] specific I mean look at the Dennis ens\n[01:42:43] they only found out about them in like\n[01:42:45] what 2010 or something like that very\n[01:42:46] very recently I think Santa and I went\n[01:42:48] to denisova cave in 2013 crazy something\n[01:42:52] like that so whole new Branch yeah of\n[01:42:54] the pre previously unknown and and and\n[01:42:56] and there's so much that's Unknown about\n[01:42:59] our past oh I know what I wanted to\n[01:43:01] bring up to you today because uh I saw\n[01:43:03] this online maybe you could find it\n[01:43:04] before I could pull it up Jamie because\n[01:43:06] you're that good uh but the there's a a\n[01:43:08] scientist that believes there's uh\n[01:43:10] reason to believe that those uh Hobbit\n[01:43:13] people in the island of Flores that they\n[01:43:16] uh exist\n[01:43:18] currently um so this was\n[01:43:21] uh yeah the hobbit-like species of early\n[01:43:24] humans may still be living in the\n[01:43:26] jungles of\n[01:43:27] Indonesia interesting Theory yeah and\n[01:43:31] well that's another branch of the human\n[01:43:33] chain that when when did they find out\n[01:43:34] about this it wasn't that long ago\n[01:43:36] either it certainly wasn't I think\n[01:43:37] you're looking around 2000s 2010 maybe\n[01:43:42] very very recent discovery I wonder what\n[01:43:44] this the latest finish public on Tuesday\n[01:43:47] journal Nature Communications follow the\n[01:43:49] 2016 discovery of tiny arm bone and\n[01:43:50] teeth um there's something that they\n[01:43:54] these people are are considering I don't\n[01:43:56] know why can see is there any article\n[01:43:58] that says they consider they're they're\n[01:44:00] still alive today that's what this one\n[01:44:02] is but that\n[01:44:04] one\n[01:44:06] no it's like a small version of Bigfoot\n[01:44:09] among yeah this it this is two years old\n[01:44:13] okay someone sent this to me\n[01:44:16] yeah so why do they think that there's\n[01:44:19] might still roam well this is just\n[01:44:21] because of anecdotal stories right cuz\n[01:44:24] there have been multiple stories that\n[01:44:27] people that live in the the Deep rain\n[01:44:29] forest have said that they've\n[01:44:30] encountered these why not why why why\n[01:44:33] not why should why should it be\n[01:44:34] impossible it it has a parallel with the\n[01:44:37] Bigfoot story of course a different size\n[01:44:39] of creature but maybe creatures have\n[01:44:42] survived which we think are extinct\n[01:44:44] especially small populations of them\n[01:44:46] that are very remote and very difficult\n[01:44:48] to get there were reports of sighting by\n[01:44:50] more than 30 eyewitnesses all of whom I\n[01:44:52] spoke with directly and I conclude the\n[01:44:53] best way to explain that they told me\n[01:44:55] what they told me is a nons sapiens\n[01:44:57] hominin has survived on Flor as to the\n[01:44:59] present or very recent times\n[01:45:02] fascinating yeah I would love to hear\n[01:45:04] their\n[01:45:05] stories oh imagine trying maybe AI could\n[01:45:09] decipher their language imagine they\n[01:45:10] found them you know how nutty it would\n[01:45:12] be if they found a little 3-ft tall\n[01:45:14] hairy human being that's still alive oh\n[01:45:16] my goodness just for uh Clarity he made\n[01:45:20] this claim and put out a book so okay\n[01:45:23] feel like come read my book you know\n[01:45:24] well it's a good thing to do if you have\n[01:45:25] a good theory\n[01:45:28] sure I know what you're saying though I\n[01:45:30] know what you're saying yeah um I hope\n[01:45:32] it's true of course of course of course\n[01:45:35] because it's fun yeah it's fun to hope\n[01:45:37] it's true all of it's fun that's what I\n[01:45:40] would what I'm so grateful to the\n[01:45:42] universe for and so grateful to my\n[01:45:45] readers for um is that I have been given\n[01:45:49] this opportunity to live a fun life oh\n[01:45:53] yeah and to travel the world and to\n[01:45:56] investigate Mysteries and to put across\n[01:45:59] my point of view on those on those\n[01:46:01] Mysteries I couldn't do any of that if\n[01:46:03] it wasn't for my readers I've never had\n[01:46:05] sponsorship I've never sought anybody to\n[01:46:07] fund me to do anything uh I started out\n[01:46:11] massively in debt I've got to the place\n[01:46:13] now where I can travel whenever I want\n[01:46:16] and and explore places and that's all\n[01:46:17] down to my readers it's it's it's not\n[01:46:19] just me it's me and my readers that are\n[01:46:21] making this this possible people and I'm\n[01:46:23] enormously grateful to them and these\n[01:46:25] days my my viewers as well you're a very\n[01:46:28] lucky man I was going to say that\n[01:46:30] earlier when you were talking about how\n[01:46:31] you've never taken a vacation like well\n[01:46:33] you haven't but your whole Life's a\n[01:46:35] vacation exactly that's why I don't see\n[01:46:37] I'm 74 years old now I don't see myself\n[01:46:39] retiring the idea of retirement is just\n[01:46:42] out of the question you try to retire\n[01:46:44] I'll go find you I'm going to go grab\n[01:46:46] you\n[01:46:47] drag I love some vitamins I love doing\n[01:46:49] what I do and and I I hope it's\n[01:46:53] contributed something something useful\n[01:46:55] to the world rather than just flimflam\n[01:46:57] I'm oh no it most certainly has it most\n[01:46:59] certainly has um you know I first found\n[01:47:01] out about you because of Fingerprints of\n[01:47:03] the Gods and one of the things that I\n[01:47:04] found Most Fascinating when I started\n[01:47:06] going into your work was the the idea\n[01:47:10] that the Arc of the Covenant exists in\n[01:47:12] in Ethiopia that's what brought me into\n[01:47:14] this field I before that I wrote All\n[01:47:16] About current affairs that story is so\n[01:47:18] nuts and it sounds so ridiculous and\n[01:47:19] people you go what the Ark of the\n[01:47:21] covenant's real but then when you go\n[01:47:23] into the history of these people that\n[01:47:25] Liv there and they all suffered\n[01:47:26] radiation poisoning and it's like wait a\n[01:47:29] minute ccts over their eyes uh and and\n[01:47:32] and let's let's not forget that there's\n[01:47:34] an indigenous population of of Old\n[01:47:36] Testament Jews in in Ethiopia the\n[01:47:39] falashas who have their own story about\n[01:47:41] how the Ark of the Covenant got there\n[01:47:43] right uh different from the Ethiopian\n[01:47:45] National epic which is called the kein\n[01:47:47] theast the glor the Glory of Kings\n[01:47:49] that's why I got into this field I was a\n[01:47:50] current affairs guy and ethiop was on my\n[01:47:53] beat and I just kept on coming across\n[01:47:55] this story and I realized it was Central\n[01:47:57] to Ethiopian culture and I I decided to\n[01:48:00] investigate it and explore it and it led\n[01:48:02] to the sign in the seal which was\n[01:48:03] published in 1992 and that's what set me\n[01:48:05] on the path to Fingerprints of the Gods\n[01:48:08] and everything that that that followed\n[01:48:09] that so who is getting the cataracts uh\n[01:48:13] the guardian of the Ark um this is a\n[01:48:15] monk uh who is appointed this the place\n[01:48:19] is axum in the province of Tigra in\n[01:48:21] Northern Ethiopia it's a massive uh\n[01:48:25] massively interesting place axum has\n[01:48:27] these huge Granite Steely they're very\n[01:48:30] similar in many ways to ancient Egyptian\n[01:48:32] obelisks they're a bit different in\n[01:48:33] shape but same sort of height some of\n[01:48:35] them going 110 ft high cut out of cut\n[01:48:38] out of solid Granite right up there in\n[01:48:40] the highlands of of uh Ethiopia and then\n[01:48:43] they have an ancient church the church\n[01:48:45] of St Mary Cathedral actually of St Mary\n[01:48:48] of Zion uh where the ark apparently was\n[01:48:50] Kept For hundreds and hundreds of years\n[01:48:53] before that it was kept elsewhere and\n[01:48:54] then now it's been moved into a chapel\n[01:48:57] that stands next to St Mary of Zion\n[01:48:59] Cathedral and that Chapel is guarded uh\n[01:49:02] by armed men the whole town is an armed\n[01:49:05] camp that is that is protecting what\n[01:49:07] they believe to be the Ark of the\n[01:49:08] Covenant but it's guarded particularly\n[01:49:10] by one guy who is the official guardian\n[01:49:13] of the Ark and he's elected uh by other\n[01:49:16] monks to be the guardian of the Ark and\n[01:49:18] and uh several of them have run away uh\n[01:49:21] when they get that election because once\n[01:49:23] you're elected as the guardian of the\n[01:49:25] Ark when the previous one has died\n[01:49:26] you're going to be kept in that Chapel\n[01:49:29] forever you'll never you'll never be\n[01:49:31] allowed to leave it so they're close to\n[01:49:33] whatever this object is they're close to\n[01:49:35] it and I met three of them over a\n[01:49:37] succession of years because their\n[01:49:39] mortality is very once they're appointed\n[01:49:41] they die very soon uh and they all have\n[01:49:44] these cataracts over their eyes and they\n[01:49:46] all blamed the object in that Chapel\n[01:49:48] whether or not it's the ark uh for for\n[01:49:50] for causing their blindness wow\n[01:49:53] so it's uh and no one is going in there\n[01:49:56] and trying to get to the bottom of it\n[01:49:57] they won't let you they won't let you\n[01:49:59] they won't they won't let you andbe them\n[01:50:03] no it seems like someone should go look\n[01:50:06] yeah what the hell is that yeah yeah\n[01:50:08] what's in there I mean if we really find\n[01:50:10] out the Arc of the Covenant was an\n[01:50:11] actual\n[01:50:13] object uh I think it was an actual\n[01:50:15] object and you think it was some nuclear\n[01:50:17] something or another like I don't know\n[01:50:18] what it was it it I think it's what is\n[01:50:21] rightly described as an out ofpl\n[01:50:23] artifact um because if you look at the\n[01:50:25] description in the book of Exodus the\n[01:50:27] the very precise dimensions of it I\n[01:50:29] think in modern terms we'd say 3' 9 in\n[01:50:33] Long by 2' 3 in high and wide it's got a\n[01:50:36] layer of gold it's got a layer of wood\n[01:50:38] it's got another layer of gold it's very\n[01:50:39] precisely specified like a blueprint in\n[01:50:41] the book of Exodus and then it does all\n[01:50:43] this stuff it shoots out Jets of fire\n[01:50:46] and kills completely innocent people uh\n[01:50:48] it it it kills 50,000 Philistines in in\n[01:50:52] the city of ashdod when they briefly\n[01:50:54] capture it from the Israelites and make\n[01:50:56] the mistake of treating it like a\n[01:50:58] tourist object and they they open the\n[01:51:00] Ark of the Covenant and look inside and\n[01:51:01] suddenly everybody in that city is dying\n[01:51:03] and what they're dying of is cancerous\n[01:51:06] tumors this is this is described in the\n[01:51:08] in in in the Old Testament so it's it's\n[01:51:11] intriguing that this object is so\n[01:51:12] precisely specified and is reported to\n[01:51:15] have done these terrible things uh it's\n[01:51:17] just insane that we know where it is\n[01:51:20] well we know that E I believe Ethiopia\n[01:51:23] has a very strong claim to it but that's\n[01:51:25] all I can say cuz I've not seen it\n[01:51:26] myself I've been right outside the door\n[01:51:28] of that Sanctuary Chapel several times\n[01:51:30] but did you bring a guer counter no that\n[01:51:33] would be a good thought yeah yeah\n[01:51:34] imagine it was going nuts as you get\n[01:51:36] close that would be a good thought I\n[01:51:38] mean it's not like it's going to be if\n[01:51:39] it's radioactive it's not like it's\n[01:51:41] going to be contained just this one\n[01:51:43] small area you're going to have traces\n[01:51:44] of it that leak out that's true they\n[01:51:46] would be a good especially if people are\n[01:51:47] getting cataracts from being in the room\n[01:51:49] with it yeah and so three different\n[01:51:51] people you talk to have cataracts yeah\n[01:51:53] yeah and they and they all blame the arc\n[01:51:54] and and one of them it's a resonant\n[01:51:56] phrase which sticks in my memory I asked\n[01:51:59] him why and he said the ark is a thing\n[01:52:03] of fire just that did he describe it to\n[01:52:06] you not be he he did describe it as a\n[01:52:08] box rather like the biblical description\n[01:52:11] unsurprisingly but uh did he describe\n[01:52:13] what it looked like like the outside of\n[01:52:15] it gold gold M gold wow uh and and of\n[01:52:20] course gold is a very good insulator uh\n[01:52:23] against radiation I don't want to go too\n[01:52:25] far down this track to me to me the the\n[01:52:27] the yeah the fascinating thing is that\n[01:52:30] that Ethiopia is the only country in the\n[01:52:31] world that actually claims to have the\n[01:52:33] Ark of the Covenant that it's Central to\n[01:52:35] religion and culture uh in Ethiopia\n[01:52:37] today that there's much to support that\n[01:52:39] argument particularly in in the form of\n[01:52:41] the falashas the Ethiopian Jews and\n[01:52:43] their very ancient Traditions about how\n[01:52:45] they got to Ethiopia in the first place\n[01:52:48] uh in in context of all of that I think\n[01:52:50] Ethiopia has a very a very good claim\n[01:52:52] very interesting claim and that's why I\n[01:52:54] wrote a book about\n[01:52:56] it that's that one to me is just like we\n[01:53:00] know where it is yeah that one to me is\n[01:53:02] so crazy that someone is keeping that\n[01:53:04] information from the rest of the humans\n[01:53:06] yeah because if if we found out the Arc\n[01:53:08] of the Covenant was in fact a real\n[01:53:10] object and we know where it is and it\n[01:53:12] does match the description in the Bible\n[01:53:14] that kind of changes everything now all\n[01:53:15] of a sudden the Bible is not just\n[01:53:17] stories and myths the Bible is some sort\n[01:53:19] of a historical record yeah well let's\n[01:53:21] not forget that one of the world's best\n[01:53:23] known flood myths also comes from the\n[01:53:24] Bible which is which is the flood of\n[01:53:26] Noah right uh which again is part of\n[01:53:28] this worldwide tradition of which I am\n[01:53:31] absolutely convinced Atlantis should be\n[01:53:33] understood as a part of that worldwide\n[01:53:35] tradition of a global flood and the loss\n[01:53:37] of a former former civilization and\n[01:53:39] again it's one of the reasons why I've\n[01:53:41] done the work I've done over these years\n[01:53:43] so when you're doing season two uh what\n[01:53:46] did you learn from doing season one that\n[01:53:49] you applied to season 2 was there\n[01:53:51] anything different about the way about\n[01:53:52] it def definitely um I have learned from\n[01:53:56] the criticisms of archaeologists uh and\n[01:53:59] one of the first things that became very\n[01:54:02] clear to me and they're absolutely right\n[01:54:04] is we need more indigenous voices in\n[01:54:07] this series and that's what we've made\n[01:54:09] sure to do uh we have an amazing uh\n[01:54:12] archaeologist indigenous archaeologist\n[01:54:15] from Easter Ireland we we spent quite a\n[01:54:18] bit of time filming in Easter isand and\n[01:54:20] it's a strong this series doesn't do\n[01:54:22] country by country episodes it's all\n[01:54:24] merged together different bits of the\n[01:54:25] story come together in each in each\n[01:54:28] episode but uh a good chunk of it is on\n[01:54:30] Easter Island and and there Sonia HOA\n[01:54:33] cardinali is uh an indigenous Easter\n[01:54:37] Islander her married name is cardinali\n[01:54:39] because she married an Italian guy uh\n[01:54:42] and she gave us incredible material on\n[01:54:45] on Easter Island and she revealed that\n[01:54:47] that she and her team have found what\n[01:54:48] are called banana phytoliths now are a\n[01:54:52] minute part of the banana plant they've\n[01:54:55] excavated them from a crater in Easter\n[01:54:58] iseland uh and they've found that those\n[01:55:00] are 3,000 years old now this is\n[01:55:03] interesting for two reasons firstly\n[01:55:05] bananas do not propagate uh naturally\n[01:55:08] you can't get bananas to Easter Island\n[01:55:10] without human beings bringing them there\n[01:55:12] that's how that's how they got there uh\n[01:55:15] and and secondly the date that she's\n[01:55:17] found 3,000-year old banana phytoliths\n[01:55:19] in Easter Ireland blows out of the water\n[01:55:21] the notion that Easter Island was only\n[01:55:23] settled a thousand years ago or less uh\n[01:55:25] which is which is the current idea of of\n[01:55:28] archaeology again and again we've had\n[01:55:30] indigenous guests on the show who have\n[01:55:33] brought real important information to it\n[01:55:35] amongst those geoglyphs uh in Brazil um\n[01:55:40] we had a member of the appara people who\n[01:55:43] who is a caretaker for those geoglyphs\n[01:55:45] and he talked to us about what is\n[01:55:48] special to him about the geoglyphs about\n[01:55:50] how this is a a sacred place to his\n[01:55:53] tribe uh and and how they still gather\n[01:55:56] there today uh and and and how they\n[01:55:59] understand that is somehow connected to\n[01:56:01] the journey to the next World to the\n[01:56:03] journey of life after death and that\n[01:56:04] then rings a bell in my mind of that\n[01:56:07] whole idea of a journey to the afterlife\n[01:56:10] and a portal through which we pass into\n[01:56:12] that other realm uh we find that right\n[01:56:15] there in Brazil so if the Easter Island\n[01:56:18] um if the island was settled at least\n[01:56:21] 3,000 years AO\n[01:56:23] do do we know where\n[01:56:25] from well 3,000 years ago you're still\n[01:56:28] within the period of the Polynesian\n[01:56:30] expansion this is not the Ice Age this\n[01:56:33] is this is more recent it's early in the\n[01:56:35] Polynesian expansion rather than late\n[01:56:37] the Easter Island was seen as was seen\n[01:56:38] as a the one of the last places that the\n[01:56:41] Polynesians got to this new evidence is\n[01:56:43] suggesting it may have been one of the\n[01:56:44] first places that the Polynesians got to\n[01:56:47] but the question that arises is did they\n[01:56:50] find the moai already in place when they\n[01:56:52] came there even 3,000 years ago and I\n[01:56:55] think there's a lot of a lot of evidence\n[01:56:57] for that I think this is going to make\n[01:56:58] archaeologists absolutely furious with\n[01:57:01] me um but I hope that that I'm paying\n[01:57:05] full respect to indigenous Traditions um\n[01:57:09] we we had um an amazing Easter iseland\n[01:57:13] Elder uh who told us the tradition of\n[01:57:17] the Lost land of hea uh Easter iseland\n[01:57:21] has its own flood myth they they say\n[01:57:23] that there was a huge land in the\n[01:57:26] Pacific Far Far Away called hea and that\n[01:57:29] it hiva and that it was destroyed in a\n[01:57:32] flood cataclysm uh and that there were\n[01:57:35] survivors specifically seven wise men\n[01:57:38] that's another thing that is found all\n[01:57:40] around the world it's found in ancient\n[01:57:42] Sumer it's found in ancient Egypt it's\n[01:57:43] found almost everywhere specific seven\n[01:57:46] seven wise men who came and settled\n[01:57:48] Easter Island after this great cataclysm\n[01:57:51] uh so it's it's it's great to have\n[01:57:52] indigenous testimony on that and then\n[01:57:54] you have the mystery of the Easter\n[01:57:55] Island script how did that happen how\n[01:57:58] come how come this tiny Island which\n[01:58:01] only ever had a population of a few\n[01:58:03] thousand did something that is normally\n[01:58:05] only done by big civilizations which was\n[01:58:08] create a written script but they have a\n[01:58:10] script the Easter Island script and it's\n[01:58:11] written on wooden boards and we learned\n[01:58:14] that these were the boards we see today\n[01:58:16] none of which by the way are in Easter\n[01:58:18] Ireland now they're all in museums\n[01:58:19] around the world they themselves were\n[01:58:21] copies of copies of copies of earlier\n[01:58:23] wooden boards that wore out and these\n[01:58:25] things go back far into the remote past\n[01:58:27] as far as the indigenous people of\n[01:58:29] Easter iseland are concerned um and and\n[01:58:32] uh to have a fully formed elaborate\n[01:58:35] script which nobody can interpret today\n[01:58:38] you have to remember the tragic history\n[01:58:39] of Easter Island there was a point where\n[01:58:41] Easter Island's population was reduced\n[01:58:44] to just 11 people and it was reduced to\n[01:58:46] 11 people by Peruvian slave raids they\n[01:58:49] came and slaved the people of Easter\n[01:58:51] Island and they took them to work in\n[01:58:53] Peru and put them elsewhere in the in in\n[01:58:55] the Pacific eventually there was a\n[01:58:57] movement to restore them to their\n[01:58:58] Homeland and gradually people came back\n[01:59:01] but at one point its population was\n[01:59:02] reduced to 11 all the elders were wiped\n[01:59:05] out those who were the memory carriers\n[01:59:07] and so what's left now is just a hint of\n[01:59:09] a memory of these things but they they\n[01:59:11] speak with awe of these uh tablets with\n[01:59:15] this with the script on it and to me\n[01:59:17] that is a sign again that there's\n[01:59:19] something wrong with our understanding\n[01:59:20] of Easter Island how can we how can we\n[01:59:22] explain that this tiny little place\n[01:59:25] produces its own written language why\n[01:59:26] would it even need a written language\n[01:59:28] when you can walk across the island in\n[01:59:29] you know three hours it wouldn't need to\n[01:59:32] communicate in that way and yet it had\n[01:59:34] its own script and the script we what is\n[01:59:37] can we see what it looks like you find\n[01:59:39] the Easter Island script Jamie if you\n[01:59:40] look up the word\n[01:59:42] rongorongo r NGO Rango rongo tablets one\n[01:59:46] of the things that's interesting about\n[01:59:47] AI is that they believe that AI is going\n[01:59:49] to be able to determine or decide Cipher\n[01:59:52] rather a bunch of different things that\n[01:59:54] we currently can't there they are oh\n[01:59:58] wow it that's crazy it Bears some\n[02:00:01] Curious it Bears some Curious\n[02:00:03] similarities to the indis valley script\n[02:00:06] uh which has also not been deciphered\n[02:00:08] and let's hope AI can decipher both of\n[02:00:10] them look at that that's so and the way\n[02:00:12] it runs the way it runs is you read from\n[02:00:14] left to right along the top row then you\n[02:00:16] go from right to left along the next row\n[02:00:18] then you go from left to right along the\n[02:00:20] next row and so on and so forth sort of\n[02:00:22] snake like how do they know that um\n[02:00:25] because that's one of the memories\n[02:00:26] that's been preserved by the Easter\n[02:00:27] Islanders and because of the way they\n[02:00:29] all run on and what do they think it\n[02:00:31] represents according to Leo the Elder\n[02:00:34] who we talk to in Easter Island um it\n[02:00:37] contains memories of the past it\n[02:00:40] contains memories of the past in Easter\n[02:00:41] isand instructions on how to navigate\n[02:00:44] information about the stars and\n[02:00:46] information about how to live as a\n[02:00:48] community wow but in a language that we\n[02:00:52] we don't know we don't know what it\n[02:00:53] sound nobody knows it all we have is an\n[02:00:55] oral tradition which itself is very\n[02:00:57] fragmented and very faint because of\n[02:00:59] that reduction of Easter Island's\n[02:01:00] population to just 11 people and the\n[02:01:03] fact that the elders who were within\n[02:01:05] historical times able to read these\n[02:01:08] tablets were all wiped out how did they\n[02:01:10] decipher Kun form cifor cfor I think\n[02:01:14] because of its relationship to later\n[02:01:15] languages which were which were known\n[02:01:18] that's the I mean Kun form is a is a\n[02:01:20] writing system you find the earliest\n[02:01:21] version I think amongst the samans and\n[02:01:23] then in in later Babylonian society as\n[02:01:26] well um but but when you have a language\n[02:01:30] and you have a language that it's\n[02:01:33] related to that you can read uh or where\n[02:01:37] you have a text in two different\n[02:01:39] languages but it's the same text then\n[02:01:42] you're in a place where you can begin to\n[02:01:43] translate it that's what the Rosetta\n[02:01:45] Stone does in in ancient Egypt because\n[02:01:48] because we have it in the ancient\n[02:01:49] Egyptian hieroglyph but we also have it\n[02:01:50] in Greek and that's why suddenly the\n[02:01:53] code of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs\n[02:01:55] was cracked because of the Rosetta Stone\n[02:01:57] well there isn't a Rosetta Stone for the\n[02:01:59] Easter Island script or for the indis\n[02:02:01] valy script um but I think in the case\n[02:02:03] of the Kun form there was something\n[02:02:05] similar some context to place it in so\n[02:02:08] the Easter Island these enormous statues\n[02:02:11] one of the things they found and I don't\n[02:02:13] know when they started doing this they\n[02:02:14] they dug deeper and deeper and deeper\n[02:02:16] and found out that the heads that are\n[02:02:17] above the surface are just a tiny part\n[02:02:19] of it absolutely so do you think that\n[02:02:22] just natural erosion that covered up\n[02:02:24] everything else no you think was purp I\n[02:02:26] think I I think it's it's a very\n[02:02:28] complicated issue the the the issue of\n[02:02:31] erosion uh it's not so much erosion it's\n[02:02:34] the deposition of sediment it's the\n[02:02:36] deposition of sediment over time over\n[02:02:38] time and what we what we looking at with\n[02:02:40] these Easter Island heads I was\n[02:02:42] fortunate to know uh there we are and\n[02:02:44] there's I was just going to say I was\n[02:02:45] fortunate to know Tor hardal and there\n[02:02:47] he is uh in the Blue Safari suit\n[02:02:50] standing at the shoulder of the the of\n[02:02:53] the Easter Island moai uh and you can\n[02:02:55] see that the dark bit is the bit that\n[02:02:57] was above ground and then they dig down\n[02:03:00] and they find that it goes down 30 ft\n[02:03:03] underground this enormous thing uh and\n[02:03:06] this is not as a result of uh of of um\n[02:03:09] being exposed by erosion this is this\n[02:03:12] had to be excavated in order to reveal\n[02:03:14] it and the and the issue is on this tiny\n[02:03:17] Island how much if if this thing is only\n[02:03:20] 700 years old which is something that\n[02:03:22] archaeologists often say 700 or a th000\n[02:03:24] years old if it's only that old how do\n[02:03:27] you get 30 ft of sedimentation on this\n[02:03:30] tiny Island in just 700 years it looks\n[02:03:33] like a much longer period that would be\n[02:03:35] required to create that depth of\n[02:03:36] sedimentation that image back up again\n[02:03:38] please so what do how much time do you\n[02:03:41] think I mean has there been speculation\n[02:03:43] like if it just natural layers of\n[02:03:45] sediment being dropped down how long\n[02:03:47] would it take to cover something like\n[02:03:49] that well this is this is where I'd like\n[02:03:50] to defer to the to the work of of Dr\n[02:03:53] Robert shock who's who's a brilliant\n[02:03:55] expert in this field we we invited\n[02:03:57] Robert shock to to join us in season two\n[02:03:59] of ancient apocalypse but he declined I\n[02:04:02] think that's unfortunate because I think\n[02:04:03] Robert shock has done breakthrough work\n[02:04:06] uh on on Easter iseland and it's Robert\n[02:04:07] shock who first first realized that this\n[02:04:10] is a problem this this deep burial of\n[02:04:13] these Statues by natural sedimentation\n[02:04:15] is a problem it's a chronological\n[02:04:17] problem that speaks to these statues\n[02:04:19] being much older than we imagined they\n[02:04:21] are\n[02:04:22] are is Robert shock declining because of\n[02:04:25] the criticism that he received about the\n[02:04:27] Temple of the Sphinx um I'm I'm not sure\n[02:04:31] why I doesn't want to deal with it\n[02:04:33] anymore I've always I've always regarded\n[02:04:35] Robert as a good friend but he and I\n[02:04:36] have not spoken since 2015 um on purpose\n[02:04:40] well I would love to speak to Robert uh\n[02:04:43] and and she try not to talk to you and I\n[02:04:44] take I take every opportunity to express\n[02:04:46] my admiration for him and Robert has\n[02:04:49] been very brave uh he a credential\n[02:04:52] geologist and he has stuck his neck out\n[02:04:54] on the Spinx and a lot of people want to\n[02:04:56] cut his head off for for for doing that\n[02:04:58] and I appreciate his courage and I\n[02:05:00] appreciate his openness of mind and his\n[02:05:02] willingness to get into this but I don't\n[02:05:04] know somewhere between 2013 we were\n[02:05:08] still good friends we we traveled to\n[02:05:09] Gung Padang together in 2013 what year\n[02:05:12] did he do the podcast\n[02:05:14] Jamie he did our podcast back in the day\n[02:05:17] I want to say it was around 2015 2016\n[02:05:21] yeah\n[02:05:23] six years ago\n[02:05:26] okay so 2018 years ago maybe that's why\n[02:05:29] stop being your friend no I don't I\n[02:05:32] don't I don't know why why it is maybe I\n[02:05:34] did something that offended him\n[02:05:36] sometimes sometimes I can be very\n[02:05:37] unpleasant and can be very very you're a\n[02:05:39] nice guy get out here we we're we're all\n[02:05:41] nice guys but some we all have a dark\n[02:05:43] side and sometimes sometimes I I am very\n[02:05:45] harsh and very I don't think I was with\n[02:05:47] Robert I don't understand what the\n[02:05:48] problem is between us he and I disagree\n[02:05:50] over the ca of the younger dras\n[02:05:52] cataclysm Robert shock believes that it\n[02:05:54] was a massive solar Outburst that\n[02:05:56] brought this catastrophe about and he\n[02:05:58] focuses on the end of the younger dras\n[02:06:00] 11,600 years ago I'm more of the view\n[02:06:03] that the comet research group is right\n[02:06:05] and that we're looking at the effect of\n[02:06:06] largely of Air Bursts of large cometary\n[02:06:09] fragments right across the surface of\n[02:06:10] the Earth uh which caused the the\n[02:06:12] younger driv why are they mutually\n[02:06:14] exclusive I don't see what no I don't\n[02:06:15] see why they're mutually exclusive they\n[02:06:17] I don't see one why one has to write off\n[02:06:19] the other what we both agree on is that\n[02:06:21] the dras between 12,800 and 11,600 years\n[02:06:24] ago was an extraordinary Global\n[02:06:28] cataclysm which changed everything which\n[02:06:30] extinguished all the megap fora of the\n[02:06:32] Ice Age We agree on that and we agree\n[02:06:34] that it likely wiped out A Lost\n[02:06:35] Civilization of the ice age as well we\n[02:06:38] disagree on the mechanism but I don't\n[02:06:40] see why we shouldn't be friends for that\n[02:06:41] so Robert if you're listening if you're\n[02:06:43] listening please let's let's let's work\n[02:06:46] together because we have we have many\n[02:06:48] common enemies and and this is one of\n[02:06:50] the problems with the alternative side\n[02:06:52] is is that there's a lot of infighting\n[02:06:54] in the alternative side and everybody's\n[02:06:56] scrambling for their own bit of turf uh\n[02:06:58] whereas the archaeological side they're\n[02:07:00] very unified uh in terms of attacking\n[02:07:03] what they call pseudoarchaeology they\n[02:07:06] they they work as a team uh and and uh\n[02:07:08] that that teamwork makes them very\n[02:07:10] efficient we're very inefficient on the\n[02:07:12] alternative side well I I'm I'm assuming\n[02:07:15] if I I shouldn't be assuming but I'm\n[02:07:16] assuming it's the criticism probably\n[02:07:18] wants to keep his job and he said\n[02:07:20] everything he wants to say and I'm not\n[02:07:23] sure uh I think Robert is open to to to\n[02:07:26] doing television the fact is we we\n[02:07:28] invited him to come to EAS Island and to\n[02:07:30] to give his point of view and and and he\n[02:07:32] declined and and therefore he he he must\n[02:07:35] have a strong reason to do that oh I\n[02:07:37] hope he still loves you but the um I\n[02:07:39] hope so too what is has anybody\n[02:07:41] speculated about how much time it would\n[02:07:43] take to cover those Easter Island\n[02:07:44] statues with thousands of years ch's\n[02:07:47] view yeah thousands thousands of years\n[02:07:49] 30 feet of dirt m\n[02:07:52] MH remember it's a small island it's in\n[02:07:54] the middle of Pacific Ocean it's 2,000\n[02:07:56] mil from Tahiti and 2,000 mil from the\n[02:07:58] coast of Peru just seems strange that\n[02:08:00] there's so many of those statues in this\n[02:08:01] one area too like what did that Island\n[02:08:04] signify like why did they do that was\n[02:08:06] well it's what it calls itself T toena\n[02:08:10] the naval of the earth it calls itself\n[02:08:12] the naval of the earth and it's not the\n[02:08:14] only place Delia in Greece calls itself\n[02:08:16] the naval of the Earth heliopolis in\n[02:08:19] Egypt close to Giza was a naval of the\n[02:08:21] Earth Anor what in Cambodia is a naval\n[02:08:25] of the earth gocke means the naval the\n[02:08:29] hill of the naval uh these these this\n[02:08:32] notion of navels of the earth I think\n[02:08:34] it's connected to an ancient geodetic\n[02:08:36] survey of the earth that there were\n[02:08:37] certain anchor points that lines of\n[02:08:39] longitude were drawn from by a\n[02:08:41] civilization that didn't have our Tech\n[02:08:43] didn't have our iPhones but did explore\n[02:08:46] the world did sail the oceans and I'm\n[02:08:49] not surprised that we haven't found\n[02:08:50] their ships since we we haven't found\n[02:08:51] the ships from those who sailed to\n[02:08:53] Australia or for those who sailed to to\n[02:08:56] Cyprus either uh but it had it had\n[02:08:59] abilities that we do not attribute to\n[02:09:01] period of that time and those abilities\n[02:09:03] included the ability to calculate\n[02:09:04] longitude something that our\n[02:09:06] civilization didn't crack until the 18th\n[02:09:08] century uh and and uh I suggest it's\n[02:09:12] only a theory that these multiple navels\n[02:09:14] of the Earth around the world were fixed\n[02:09:17] points on the Earth where longitude\n[02:09:21] connections were made they were\n[02:09:23] established places so I do not think\n[02:09:26] it's an accident that Anor wat is 72\n[02:09:30] degrees of longitude east of Giza uh\n[02:09:34] because that number 72 occurs in ancient\n[02:09:37] myths all around the world and is\n[02:09:39] strongly connected to this phenomenon\n[02:09:42] called precession of the equinoxes which\n[02:09:45] um first of all it changes the pole star\n[02:09:48] at the moment our the Earth wobbles on\n[02:09:50] its axis but it's a very slow wobble\n[02:09:52] over 26,000 years uh it changes the poar\n[02:09:55] now it's Polaris in the past it was\n[02:09:58] thuban in the past it was Draco but but\n[02:10:00] but now it's now it's Polaris um because\n[02:10:03] the extended North Pole of the earth is\n[02:10:06] spiraling in the heavens and it's\n[02:10:08] pointing at different bits of space over\n[02:10:10] a roughly 26,000 year period\n[02:10:13] 25,920 years to be exact one degree of\n[02:10:16] procession takes 72 years to unfold um\n[02:10:19] that's why the fact that the Rel\n[02:10:21] relationship of the Great Pyramid to the\n[02:10:22] Earth being on the scale of 1 to 43,200\n[02:10:26] is interesting if it was on the scale of\n[02:10:28] 1 to 57,000 I couldn't care less but\n[02:10:31] 43,200 is one of those numbers that we\n[02:10:33] find in mythology and traditions all\n[02:10:35] around the world um and and uh there's\n[02:10:38] very solid scholarly backing for this in\n[02:10:41] in a book I've mentioned to you before\n[02:10:42] which is called Hamlet's Mill by Georgio\n[02:10:45] de santiana and he of vesan Georgia was\n[02:10:48] professor of History of Science at MIT\n[02:10:50] they draw attention to this that there\n[02:10:52] appears to have been a very ancient\n[02:10:54] knowledge of this obscure astronomical\n[02:10:56] phenomenon which our culture attributes\n[02:10:59] to the Greeks and thinks only goes back\n[02:11:01] a couple of thousand years santiana and\n[02:11:03] vesan were of the view that it goes back\n[02:11:05] to what they called some almost\n[02:11:07] unbelievable ancestor civilization of\n[02:11:10] the remote past how could they even know\n[02:11:13] that that was happening like by what\n[02:11:15] method could they make those\n[02:11:16] calculations that the Earth wobbles on x\n[02:11:18] axis every 26,000 years like you you\n[02:11:21] have to pass you have to observe for\n[02:11:23] more than one human lifetime you've got\n[02:11:25] to you've got to keep observing and then\n[02:11:27] extrapolate the wobble well you may have\n[02:11:29] to you may you may have to observe for\n[02:11:31] hundreds of years in order to conclude\n[02:11:33] that it's a wobble is another thing but\n[02:11:37] to conclude that the the skies are\n[02:11:39] changing at a regular fixed rate that's\n[02:11:41] going to take observation over a few\n[02:11:43] hundred years 72 years is is one human\n[02:11:46] lifetime in that 72 years the the\n[02:11:48] processional shift would be the\n[02:11:50] equivalent of the width of your finger\n[02:11:51] held up to the Horizon very hard to note\n[02:11:54] but if you extend it for several hundred\n[02:11:56] years it'll be very clear that something\n[02:11:58] is going on and what's and what's going\n[02:11:59] on is the constellation that rises\n[02:12:02] behind the sun particularly notable at\n[02:12:05] Key moments of the year the summer and\n[02:12:08] winter solstice and the spring and\n[02:12:09] Autumn Equinox and and the age in which\n[02:12:13] we live uh as anybody of course\n[02:12:16] astrology is another one of those things\n[02:12:17] that archaeologists despise but as\n[02:12:19] anybody who follows astrology will know\n[02:12:22] we live in the dawning of the age of\n[02:12:23] Aquarius and and that's because the sun\n[02:12:26] on the Spring Equinox is within the next\n[02:12:28] 150 years is going to move entirely out\n[02:12:31] of Pisces where it sits at the moment\n[02:12:33] and is going to move into Aquarius the\n[02:12:36] edge of Pisces with Pisces housing the\n[02:12:39] sun on the Spring Equinox began around\n[02:12:41] the time of Christ about just over 2,000\n[02:12:43] years ago uh and and before that it was\n[02:12:46] the age of Aries we have all this Ram\n[02:12:48] symbolism in ancient Egypt at that time\n[02:12:50] before that it was the age of Taurus\n[02:12:52] constellation of Taurus housing the sun\n[02:12:54] all of this is a process that unfolds at\n[02:12:56] the rate of one degree every 72 years so\n[02:12:58] when I find that the Great Pyramid\n[02:13:01] models the Earth on a scale of 1 to\n[02:13:03] 43,200 which is 72 * 600 I wake up and I\n[02:13:07] think this is interesting and when I\n[02:13:09] find the Anor one Naval of the earth is\n[02:13:11] separated from Giza another Naval of the\n[02:13:13] Earth by 72 degrees of longitude that\n[02:13:16] Rings another Bell and I think that's\n[02:13:18] something curious and worthy of\n[02:13:19] exploration I think I think we also when\n[02:13:22] we talk about ancient people studying\n[02:13:25] the sky we we think of the sky today and\n[02:13:28] our Sky unfortunately is burdened by\n[02:13:30] light pollution almost everywhere\n[02:13:32] anywhere their civilization it's very\n[02:13:33] difficult to see the stars whereas they\n[02:13:36] had none of that and they were in\n[02:13:37] constant awe of this thing that they\n[02:13:40] could see every night and they probably\n[02:13:41] had a very detailed understanding of\n[02:13:44] where everything was you know in a way\n[02:13:47] that you're far more detailed than most\n[02:13:48] people have today right because we we\n[02:13:50] don't have access to it unless you're in\n[02:13:52] like deep you know deep Wilderness and\n[02:13:55] with a clear night sky the presence of\n[02:13:57] the sky in our lives if we're living in\n[02:14:00] a city is close to zero it's not zero\n[02:14:03] but it's close to zero bizarre yeah it's\n[02:14:05] a bizarre Detachment that is propagated\n[02:14:09] by technology oh yeah very very much so\n[02:14:11] very weird right because it's actually\n[02:14:13] dangerous for us yeah CU I think it\n[02:14:15] makes us disconnected from the idea that\n[02:14:17] we're connected totally to the universe\n[02:14:19] and that that feeling of awe that you\n[02:14:21] get when you see a completely\n[02:14:23] star-filled night I um I've talked about\n[02:14:26] this before but I'll say it again I was\n[02:14:28] in um the the observatory in uh the big\n[02:14:32] island in Hawaii and when you go up to\n[02:14:34] the kek observatory the sky you go\n[02:14:36] through the clouds and when you get up\n[02:14:39] to the top and you look you can't\n[02:14:41] believe that you could see it you can't\n[02:14:43] believe I've been there three four times\n[02:14:47] only once did we really catch it the\n[02:14:48] last time was pretty good but one time\n[02:14:50] we caught it perfectly where there was\n[02:14:51] no moon in the sky and the sky was\n[02:14:53] completely clear and it was astounding\n[02:14:56] astounding yeah you feel like it's a\n[02:14:58] windshield and you are on a spaceship\n[02:15:00] and you're flying through deep space you\n[02:15:01] see stars everywhere which beautiful way\n[02:15:03] to put it that's exactly what we are\n[02:15:06] we're in a convertible we're in a\n[02:15:07] convertable spaceship flying through the\n[02:15:08] universe that's really what it is and\n[02:15:10] you don't see it every day because of\n[02:15:11] light pollution and I think it's one of\n[02:15:14] the\n[02:15:15] most it's one of the saddest things\n[02:15:18] about our culture it's incredible that\n[02:15:20] you can go out at night and you could\n[02:15:21] see and you know drive and go to your\n[02:15:23] favorite restaurant go to the movies and\n[02:15:25] all kinds of nice stuff but what's what\n[02:15:28] we're trading off is literally our\n[02:15:31] connection to this insanely beautiful\n[02:15:35] thing yeah that hypnotizes you with its\n[02:15:38] awe it just you look at this if you get\n[02:15:40] to go camping on a night where you see\n[02:15:42] everything it's it's incredible it's one\n[02:15:44] of the greatest things you could ever\n[02:15:46] see and it used to be there for\n[02:15:48] everybody and it used to be how they\n[02:15:49] live their life it was an present\n[02:15:51] reality uh it was impossible to avoid it\n[02:15:54] and and and that is why it's so crazy to\n[02:15:57] say that the phenomenon like procession\n[02:15:59] wasn't discovered until the Greeks about\n[02:16:01] 2,200 years ago because the Ancients\n[02:16:03] were living with those skies for\n[02:16:05] thousands and thousands of years before\n[02:16:06] and they were paying very close\n[02:16:08] attention to them there there's there's\n[02:16:10] strong evidence that the the\n[02:16:11] constellations of the zodiac were were\n[02:16:14] not inventions of the Greek Greeks\n[02:16:16] either I mean in a sense the\n[02:16:17] constellations aren't inventions because\n[02:16:20] they they happen to be on the path of\n[02:16:21] the sun the Zodiac are the\n[02:16:23] constellations which roughly are in the\n[02:16:25] place in the sky that the sun occupies\n[02:16:27] through through the course of the year\n[02:16:28] that's why we we see them but but\n[02:16:31] there's there's increasing evidence that\n[02:16:33] the the Greeks inherited that and that\n[02:16:35] the knowledge was very early and it may\n[02:16:36] well go back into the upper Paleolithic\n[02:16:38] there's this incredible figure of Taurus\n[02:16:41] in the Hall of bulls at Lasco cave in\n[02:16:44] France one of those cave paintings which\n[02:16:46] shows the stars of the pades above the\n[02:16:48] shoulder of the bull exactly where they\n[02:16:50] should be M what what is the oldest\n[02:16:53] version of astrology that we\n[02:16:56] have well again you you know you have\n[02:17:00] the official position on this and you\n[02:17:02] have you have the unofficial the\n[02:17:03] official position well the official\n[02:17:04] position is that that it it's something\n[02:17:06] that developed during the time of the\n[02:17:09] late Mesopotamians and the Greeks uh\n[02:17:12] this this notion that somehow there was\n[02:17:13] a connection between the the the sky\n[02:17:16] events in the sky and and and what\n[02:17:17] happens to us um but I think it's much\n[02:17:20] Sher than that I think it's I think the\n[02:17:23] the the idea that the sky in some way\n[02:17:25] determines our Destinies uh is a very\n[02:17:28] ancient idea not a not a recent idea uh\n[02:17:32] and and it kind of makes sense I mean\n[02:17:35] it's weird to think this I don't mean to\n[02:17:36] be um selfish to the human race but we\n[02:17:39] would not be here no human beings would\n[02:17:41] be here if it were not for that whole\n[02:17:42] vast Universe out there it's it it would\n[02:17:45] be wrong to say that the Universe exists\n[02:17:48] so that we can be right but but the fact\n[02:17:50] as we would not be uh we're we're we're\n[02:17:53] part of that huge Cosmos uh and you're\n[02:17:56] right it's it's forgetting that we're\n[02:17:58] part of the cosmos or or regarding the\n[02:18:00] cosmos as something that we must conquer\n[02:18:03] uh which is the modern mindset which is\n[02:18:05] which is most\n[02:18:06] unhelpful yeah\n[02:18:08] it's I've always been fascinated by\n[02:18:10] astrology not like the newspaper\n[02:18:12] astrology like you're a cancer so that\n[02:18:14] means this like but the idea that the\n[02:18:16] time you were born the place on Earth\n[02:18:18] you were born the where you were\n[02:18:21] conceived all these play a factor in\n[02:18:24] your personality and that this was\n[02:18:26] somehow or another mapped out yeah by\n[02:18:29] people thousands and thousands of years\n[02:18:31] ago I know a lot of people like to\n[02:18:33] dismiss it as myth and I've been one of\n[02:18:35] those people but part of me wonders if\n[02:18:38] there is some sort of an impact that\n[02:18:41] look we know that the Gravity from the\n[02:18:43] Moon affects the tides we know that\n[02:18:45] we're mostly water we know that there's\n[02:18:47] some sort of an effect that planets and\n[02:18:49] gravity and stars must have on the\n[02:18:53] entirety of the universe and the idea\n[02:18:56] that these very bizarre biological\n[02:18:59] entities that their personalities and\n[02:19:01] their existence is in some way motivated\n[02:19:04] shaped or at least influenced by the\n[02:19:07] position in the stars in which they were\n[02:19:10] born is very interesting because people\n[02:19:13] studied that [ __ ] for a long time if if\n[02:19:15] was there was nothing to it why would\n[02:19:18] they why why have so many generations of\n[02:19:21] people studied it I think it's a good\n[02:19:22] question and what was the root of it\n[02:19:24] like how the hell did they figure that\n[02:19:26] out well it must come from a place where\n[02:19:28] we feel connected to the universe and we\n[02:19:30] feel that the Universe influences us\n[02:19:31] directly right uh not the way we look at\n[02:19:35] it at the moment as sort of something\n[02:19:37] out there that doesn't mean much to us\n[02:19:38] except that we're going to conquer it\n[02:19:39] with spaceships right you know and and\n[02:19:42] go to the moon and go to planets and\n[02:19:45] things like that but but to see it as an\n[02:19:47] everpresent reality we understand that\n[02:19:49] we're affected by the climate on planet\n[02:19:51] Earth we understand we're affected by\n[02:19:53] the weather by the oceans by the winds\n[02:19:56] we they have they affect us they affect\n[02:19:57] our personalities so why shouldn't we be\n[02:19:59] affected by the broader universe that\n[02:20:01] that that surrounds us yeah it it does\n[02:20:03] make sense but I've never heard anybody\n[02:20:05] explain it have you ever talked to like\n[02:20:06] a legitimate air quotes astrologer no I\n[02:20:10] haven't it's not it's not been a central\n[02:20:11] Focus for me my my my central Focus has\n[02:20:14] more been on the evidence for really\n[02:20:16] precise ancient astronomy uh\n[02:20:18] particularly amongst the ancient\n[02:20:19] Egyptians but also\n[02:20:21] fantastically Advanced amongst the Maya\n[02:20:24] uh in uh Mexico as as as well and we\n[02:20:28] have a big focus on the Maya uh in\n[02:20:30] season 2 of ancient apocalypse and I I\n[02:20:33] had was fortunate blessed to have a\n[02:20:36] brilliant archaeologist Ed Barnhart uh\n[02:20:38] who joined me there in pelen and he's\n[02:20:40] not sneering at me he doesn't agree with\n[02:20:43] everything I say he's very clear on that\n[02:20:45] but he's not sneering at me and he feel\n[02:20:46] he feels that there's something useful\n[02:20:48] being contributed by this this approach\n[02:20:50] and so so is it generally agreed that\n[02:20:52] the there is a connection between the\n[02:20:55] the methods or the the the design of the\n[02:20:58] construction and the correlation between\n[02:21:00] Star systems I don't follow the question\n[02:21:03] quite is there is it agreed by\n[02:21:05] archaeologists that the reason why these\n[02:21:08] things are constructed in a very\n[02:21:10] specific Direction and a very specific\n[02:21:13] design that it is mirroring the cosmos I\n[02:21:16] think that archaeologists are very\n[02:21:18] reluctant to accept the broader idea\n[02:21:21] they are willing they can hardly deny\n[02:21:23] that some structures are specifically\n[02:21:25] aligned to the equinoxial rising point\n[02:21:27] of the Sun in other words duwi East and\n[02:21:30] other structures are aligned to the\n[02:21:32] rising or the setting of the sun on the\n[02:21:34] summer or the winter solstice uh that\n[02:21:36] cannot be denied Serpent Mound in Ohio\n[02:21:39] is a classic example of that uh which is\n[02:21:42] which is oriented precisely to the\n[02:21:44] Setting Sun on the winter solstice um\n[02:21:47] but the the broader idea that for\n[02:21:49] example uh positions of stars in the sky\n[02:21:52] might be replicated on the ground uh\n[02:21:54] that's an idea that archaeology\n[02:21:56] completely Rejects and that's where I\n[02:21:58] would like to pay tribute to my dear\n[02:22:00] friend Robert Bal who's been very ill\n[02:22:02] for the last many years but Robert Bal\n[02:22:05] brought us the Orion correlation and my\n[02:22:07] god did archaeology descend upon him\n[02:22:09] like a ton of bricks for just noticing\n[02:22:12] that the three Great Pyramids of Giza\n[02:22:13] are laid out on the ground in the\n[02:22:15] pattern of the three stars of Orion's\n[02:22:16] Belt and then when we work precession\n[02:22:19] into the equation we find that they're\n[02:22:21] not laid out in the pattern of Orion's\n[02:22:23] Belt as it looked in 2,500 BC when the\n[02:22:26] pyramids are supposed to have been built\n[02:22:28] they're laid out in the pattern of\n[02:22:29] Orion's Belt in 10,500 BC 12 a half\n[02:22:32] thousand years ago so it's like a marker\n[02:22:35] on the Giza Plateau speaking to that age\n[02:22:38] just as pillar 43 at gockley tee speaks\n[02:22:41] to that age when in the astronomical\n[02:22:43] diagram on that on that pillar which\n[02:22:45] also means that there would have been\n[02:22:46] align 35,000 years ago as well yeah it\n[02:22:49] that's right because it's a cycle yeah\n[02:22:51] it go it goes back then the the Sphinx\n[02:22:54] is another one of those right yeah the\n[02:22:55] Sphinx is another one the the Sphinx\n[02:22:58] aligned with it it was looking at the\n[02:23:00] Rising Sun and behind it the\n[02:23:02] constellation of Leo 12 and a half\n[02:23:04] thousand years ago but if you go back 25\n[02:23:07] 26,000 years before that you'll find the\n[02:23:09] same alignment occurring it it's a cycle\n[02:23:11] it's not a one-off event it it's a cycle\n[02:23:14] that occurs every 26,000 years it's a\n[02:23:17] mindblower it's a mindblower and that's\n[02:23:19] why John Anthony West I'm so glad you\n[02:23:21] had him on your show a couple times\n[02:23:23] before he passed he he was such a genius\n[02:23:25] and such a such a funny guy he I\n[02:23:27] recommend um that to everybody that\n[02:23:29] magical Egypt the two DVD series that he\n[02:23:32] had they were amazing my wife hated them\n[02:23:35] cuz I was watching them so often you\n[02:23:37] watched this Egypt thing again I\n[02:23:38] couldn't stop yeah I probably watched it\n[02:23:41] 30 times he was an absolute genius and\n[02:23:43] and and John was of the view that the\n[02:23:45] Sphinx is more than 30,000 years old ra\n[02:23:47] rather than just 12 and a half thousand\n[02:23:49] years old well that's what aligned so\n[02:23:51] interestingly with Robert\n[02:23:53] shock's analysis of the water erosion\n[02:23:57] that this is thousands of years of\n[02:23:59] rainfall yeah yeah that's that's the\n[02:24:01] really important matter that Robert\n[02:24:03] shock has brought to the table which no\n[02:24:05] other person has dared to do now John\n[02:24:08] Anthony West started that process he he\n[02:24:11] was aware of a problem in the weathering\n[02:24:13] of the Sphinx but he wasn't quite sure\n[02:24:15] what the problem was he he was following\n[02:24:17] up some writings by uh a scholar called\n[02:24:20] schalla debik uh back in the 1920s or\n[02:24:23] 1930s who' said something about water\n[02:24:24] weathering on the Sphinx and so John\n[02:24:26] brought Robert shock there to gizer and\n[02:24:28] Robert shock immediately recognized the\n[02:24:31] weathering patterns on the Sphinx as the\n[02:24:33] result of heavy rainfall exposure\n[02:24:35] exposure to heavy rainfall for thousands\n[02:24:38] of years and you have to go back to the\n[02:24:40] younger drar to get that kind of heavy\n[02:24:42] rainfall in Giza hence the notion that\n[02:24:45] the that the Sphinx geologically\n[02:24:47] whatever else we may say about it is\n[02:24:49] 12,000 plus years old and it was\n[02:24:52] courageous of Robert to do that he put\n[02:24:54] his own career in Jeopardy just like\n[02:24:55] anybody who sticks their neck out in\n[02:24:57] this field does he put his own career in\n[02:24:59] Jeopardy by standing up for a much older\n[02:25:01] Sphinx and I I just hugely respect him\n[02:25:03] for doing that I also thought it was\n[02:25:05] really fascinating that he showed images\n[02:25:07] cropped images of this water erosion to\n[02:25:10] other geologists they all agreed it was\n[02:25:12] water erosion until they figured out\n[02:25:13] where it was there you go and they were\n[02:25:15] like I'm not signing off on that that's\n[02:25:17] that's right that's right because it's\n[02:25:18] just too controversial yeah they circle\n[02:25:20] the wagons at a certain point and go\n[02:25:23] after your career yeah yeah most\n[02:25:25] unfortunately well we are very fortunate\n[02:25:27] that you're out there buddy thank you we\n[02:25:29] really are and uh I love your show I\n[02:25:31] love you you're always fun to talk to\n[02:25:33] can I say appreciate you very much a\n[02:25:35] couple of things about the show sure\n[02:25:36] please first of all um thank

table\n[02:25:50] and a special request if you do like it\n[02:25:52] please give it a thumbs up on\n[02:25:55] Netflix uh season 2 is all about the\n[02:25:59] Americas uh\n[02:26:02] secondly I will be doing a speaking\n[02:26:05] event in the US it'll be the only\n[02:26:07] speaking event that I do in 2025 and\n[02:26:09] that's going to be in Sedona 19th and\n[02:26:12] 20th of April 202 that's a good place\n[02:26:14] for it all those freaks yeah 19th and\n[02:26:16] 20th of April 2025 and it's going to be\n[02:26:18] called the fight for the PO\n[02:26:20] because I believe that's what's uh\n[02:26:22] that's what's going on here um so I hope\n[02:26:27] that uh people will enjoy the show and\n[02:26:29] and express that enjoyment that would be\n[02:26:32] really really helpful I know they will I\n[02:26:34] know they will and the last the final\n[02:26:36] thing I want to say is thank you to\n[02:26:37] Keanu re thank you to Keanu re for\n[02:26:40] joining me on the show Keanu reached out\n[02:26:43] to me some years ago because he's making\n[02:26:46] this incredible comic book series called\n[02:26:49] Berserker be R ZR KR uh about an\n[02:26:53] immortal Warrior who's born 880,000\n[02:26:56] years ago but has the power of a God and\n[02:26:58] cannot be killed and back I think in at\n[02:27:01] least two years ago Keanu reached out to\n[02:27:03] me for some some advice some historical\n[02:27:05] advice on where in the world could such\n[02:27:07] an individual have have been born 80,000\n[02:27:10] years ago and we talked about that and\n[02:27:12] we exchanged emails and then we had some\n[02:27:14] some nice Zoom conversations together\n[02:27:17] that's cool and and and uh I sense that\n[02:27:19] this is this is a very open-minded very\n[02:27:22] curious very interesting person so when\n[02:27:24] we were doing doing season 2 I I did ask\n[02:27:27] him would you would would would you join\n[02:27:28] me and speak about this and and speak\n[02:27:30] about your curiosity of the past and and\n[02:27:32] he knew what he was up against actually\n[02:27:34] just before Kean and I spent a day\n[02:27:36] together filming for for season two of\n[02:27:38] ancient apocalypse he'd watched the\n[02:27:40] debate between me and Flint Dibble he\n[02:27:42] knew what he was facing getting getting\n[02:27:44] into this but he had again the courage\n[02:27:46] and the Integrity to stand up to Stand\n[02:27:49] By Me\n[02:27:51] uh in that story and I'm enormously\n[02:27:53] grateful to him for doing that and I\n[02:27:55] found along the way I suspected it when\n[02:27:57] we knew each other just by zoom and by\n[02:27:59] email I found along the way what an\n[02:28:02] incredible gentleman keano Reeves is
