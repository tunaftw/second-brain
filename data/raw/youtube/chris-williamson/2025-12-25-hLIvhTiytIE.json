Uh this is my\n[00:12] living room in Newcastle and this is\n[00:14] Johnny. Uh and this is George. Uh and\n[00:18] that's Yousef and he's in Malaysia. Uh\n[00:20] and this is a Christmas episode. We've\n[00:21] got one day to turn this around. So\n[00:23] merry Christmas. It's Christmas Day. Um\n[00:26] enjoy the turkey and the pigs and\n[00:28] blankets. Uh, and we are going to do\n[00:30] some lessons and life hacks and fails\n[00:32] from the last 12 months. It's kind of a\n[00:34] Christmas tradition, I suppose. And also\n[00:37] another part of the tradition is that\n[00:40] you go first, Johnny. So, give us a life\n[00:42] hack.\n[00:42] >> Yeah. All right. My life hack, which\n[00:45] might not be allowed. We'll see if it\n[00:47] gets past the the Chris rule, has\n[00:49] already been a life hack.\n[00:51] >> Okay.\n[00:51] >> Is that all right? The best ones.\n[00:52] >> Yeah. Yeah. It's the reason it's a life\n[00:54] hack is I was speaking to a few friends\n[00:57] about this and neither of them had heard\n[00:59] of it and I was like, you know, I\n[01:01] thought Chris building here.\n[01:03] >> I know. Well, it's it's the waking up\n[01:05] app by Sam Harris.\n[01:07] >> Okay.\n[01:09] >> Okay.\n[01:09] >> Why is that bad?\n[01:10] >> He's been sponsored.\n[01:11] >> It's not. Have you been paid off by Big\n[01:12] Sam?\n[01:15] >> Big meditate. Big meditations come to\n[01:17] me.\n[01:17] >> I think Well, do do you guys meditate?\n[01:20] Yes.\n[01:20] >> No. Yes. I think it is the\n[01:24] well so so the hack specifically is\n[01:27] download the app using the cut no\n[01:30] download the app and listen to the\n[01:32] fundamentals\n[01:34] like theory series and it's like five\n[01:37] audios with Sam explaining why you\n[01:39] should meditate and I think that is the\n[01:42] thing I so I've meditated every day this\n[01:44] year it's the first time it's ever\n[01:45] happened and it was that audio series\n[01:48] >> but that's not a meditation that's just\n[01:50] buy in.\n[01:51] >> Yeah. So the the app is also I think it\n[01:53] makes it it's just like a daily order\n[01:54] you can follow. They're different every\n[01:55] day.\n[01:56] >> Okay.\n[01:56] >> It's like daily programming programming\n[01:58] for me.\n[01:59] >> But this was important because it got\n[02:01] you to buy into doing\n[02:02] >> Yeah. So there's there's like an analogy\n[02:04] he uses in it which is this is this\n[02:06] isn't word for word but something like\n[02:08] everyone's in a in a dream about being a\n[02:11] human being and it's like the dream is\n[02:13] you're in a prison cell and everyone's\n[02:15] trying to make the prison cell nicer by\n[02:16] like buying things moving them around\n[02:18] and changing where the windows are and\n[02:20] that's life and meditating allows you to\n[02:23] just wake up from the dream and it's a\n[02:25] completely different way of viewing kind\n[02:28] of everybody's absorbed in their\n[02:30] thoughts and their feelings and just\n[02:31] being run by their mind\n[02:33] >> and meditating is just waking up from\n[02:35] the dream. But that series completely\n[02:37] changed\n[02:39] >> how I feel about meditating.\n[02:40] >> But this you're not saying this as\n[02:41] someone who hadn't med meditated a lot\n[02:43] before\n[02:44] >> it. Yeah.\n[02:45] >> You've done thousands of sessions of\n[02:46] meditation previously.\n[02:48] >> Yeah. But I think the the difference is\n[02:50] it's kind of like the switch where you\n[02:53] go from like going to the gym because\n[02:55] like you think you should to it just\n[02:57] becomes like part of your personality,\n[03:00] part of what you do. And that identity\n[03:02] change for me was that series.\n[03:04] >> Do you feel that Yousef?\n[03:08] >> Yeah. The identity shift is is big as\n[03:11] well. The uh the quote of watch your\n[03:15] thoughts because they become your words.\n[03:16] Watch your words because they become\n[03:18] your actions. Watch your actions because\n[03:20] they become your habits become your\n[03:22] beliefs, your perception, your identity.\n[03:24] Um so like starting at that means that\n[03:27] the downstream habits are much easier to\n[03:29] stick to. I also love the uh rearranging\n[03:32] the furniture in the prison cell\n[03:34] analogy.\n[03:37] >> So, how long are you doing these\n[03:38] sessions for?\n[03:40] >> I'll do like So, the standard one is\n[03:43] like 10 minutes long and I'll do I'll do\n[03:45] that as the minimum and then\n[03:48] >> if it's going well, I'll keep going.\n[03:50] >> If it's like, you know, those days, you\n[03:51] know, especially ones where he like\n[03:53] makes you have your eyes open.\n[03:54] >> They're hard. they're particularly\n[03:56] difficult. It's just sitting there like\n[03:58] >> those are difficult to do. But if it's I\n[04:01] think the easiest way to make it a an\n[04:03] effortless habit is not trying to do 30\n[04:06] minutes or 40 minutes. Just have a\n[04:07] minimum and then\n[04:08] >> So how is getting out of the prison cell\n[04:10] going?\n[04:12] >> I Good question. I I have glimpses where\n[04:14] I'm like, \"Oh, this is just a dream of\n[04:15] being in a prison cell.\" What does that\n[04:17] mean? The difficult Well,\n[04:20] what does it mean? It's the identifying\n[04:24] with your thoughts versus it's the\n[04:27] experience of of a self.\n[04:29] >> I feel like this is for the first life\n[04:30] hack. This is going I also don't feel\n[04:32] like I'm qualified to talk about this.\n[04:34] That's what that's what this\n[04:35] >> that's why I referred to the um referred\n[04:37] to the the app because I think Sam is\n[04:38] qualified to talk about it. But it's a\n[04:42] it changes your perspective and your\n[04:44] relationship with yourself and with now\n[04:47] with the present moment.\n[04:49] The happiness trap doesn't even need to\n[04:53] be that metaphysical. It's just like\n[04:56] usually we we are motivated to do\n[04:57] something to close a gap between desire\n[04:59] and outcome and we do that and our brain\n[05:02] goes and just releases a bit of like\n[05:05] some neurochemical that makes us happy\n[05:06] for a moment and then that neurochemical\n[05:08] depletes and then we think that we have\n[05:10] to go and achieve the thing in order to\n[05:11] give uselves permission to release the\n[05:14] little bit again into our brains and\n[05:16] it's just that cycle. Whereas if you\n[05:18] realize that it's your brain that's\n[05:19] releasing that stuff and you can just do\n[05:21] it on tap, then you've shortcircuited\n[05:23] the whole process and you're not having\n[05:24] to\n[05:25] >> chase some something out there.\n[05:27] >> Such a good point. There was a\n[05:29] resurfaced clip of the first Huberman\n[05:31] episode that I did from mid2022\n[05:34] that I saw the other day and he's got\n[05:36] this line in it where he says, \"It's all\n[05:37] internal. Everything in life is all\n[05:40] internal. You finish a marathon in first\n[05:43] place and you've been working your\n[05:44] entire life to do it and you run across\n[05:46] the finish line and that sensation, no\n[05:49] one else comes along and drips dopamine\n[05:52] down the back of your brain stem. Like\n[05:54] this is just you generating all of this.\n[05:58] Now obviously we're designed to respond\n[06:02] to what happens in the real world. Like\n[06:05] that's the entire way that we're sort of\n[06:06] adaptively evolved. But it does suggest\n[06:09] that well if you can get closer to the\n[06:12] root of where all of this stuff's coming\n[06:14] from which is just internally\n[06:16] >> uh you can probably at least make it\n[06:19] easier to achieve what it is that you\n[06:21] want without having to fight into a\n[06:22] headwind all the time. Well even the\n[06:24] real world because you have uh 10 times\n[06:28] the number of neurons going from your\n[06:30] brain to your eye than you do from your\n[06:32] eye to your brain. So your eye is\n[06:34] actually taking more information from\n[06:36] your brain than than the other way\n[06:38] around.\n[06:38] >> So it's constant your brain's constantly\n[06:41] creating a prediction of reality. So the\n[06:43] best example is you know when you're\n[06:44] kind of walking downstairs and this\n[06:45] happens to me way too often where you\n[06:47] think there's another stair and you're\n[06:49] at the end and you kind of feel the\n[06:52] stair um and then your foot goes down\n[06:54] and you for a second you feel it's there\n[06:56] and then you go oh [ __ ] and then you\n[06:57] fall. Um but your brain kind of\n[06:59] simulated the reality. So your brain's\n[07:02] constantly making these prediction\n[07:03] models that don't actually exist. And\n[07:06] then when you have an error or you have\n[07:08] a failure, that's when it\n[07:10] >> constantly corrects. So I like when you\n[07:11] think something's lemonade, but actually\n[07:13] it's water.\n[07:13] >> Yeah.\n[07:14] >> Exactly.\n[07:16] >> Happen a lot to you.\n[07:17] >> Once a week,\n[07:20] >> but you know that there's that moment at\n[07:21] the moment of like\n[07:23] >> something horrible's happening.\n[07:25] >> Something horrible's happened.\n[07:27] >> Something horrible's happening.\n[07:28] >> Yeah. And I know it's fine.\n[07:29] >> It's just water. It's just water. All\n[07:30] right, that's a good one. Waking up at\n[07:32] 7.\n[07:32] >> It's a meta hack, isn't it? It's the\n[07:34] thing that like change your relationship\n[07:35] with now and everything.\n[07:37] >> What was the What's the intro course\n[07:39] thing called again?\n[07:40] >> It's called the fundamentals. So, in\n[07:42] waking up, there's theory practice.\n[07:44] There's like lectures to listen to.\n[07:45] There's all the Alan Watt series, but\n[07:46] there's a there's an initial intro\n[07:48] series called the fundamentals by Sam\n[07:50] where he's basically trying to convince\n[07:51] you\n[07:51] >> to meditate.\n[07:53] >> And it's like five audios. They're all\n[07:54] about 10 minutes long.\n[07:56] >> Mhm.\n[07:56] >> Awesome.\n[07:57] >> Wow. It's like that time when you made\n[08:00] me read the beginning, all of the\n[08:02] beginning of a 6-inute diary.\n[08:04] >> Yes. Yes.\n[08:05] >> And you insisted and I was like, \"Okay,\n[08:07] I'm reading.\" But reading it is what got\n[08:10] me to use it every day.\n[08:11] >> Of course,\n[08:11] >> reading that intro.\n[08:12] >> Have you heard of Janna meditation?\n[08:14] >> Here we go.\n[08:15] >> Here we go.\n[08:16] >> This is a fun one of um cuz I think what\n[08:18] happens to a lot of people is they go\n[08:20] via the mindfulness route, which is what\n[08:22] a lot of people get on boarded to\n[08:23] >> but you realize, oh, that's just\n[08:25] >> a way. So there's lots of different\n[08:26] ways.\n[08:26] >> It's like thinking about exercise and\n[08:28] only looking at running.\n[08:29] >> Exactly. Um which is basically what's\n[08:31] kind of happened in that space. But the\n[08:33] Janna meditation idea is when you\n[08:35] essentially keep rather than focus on\n[08:37] your breath, you focus on something that\n[08:39] brings you great joy and it go\n[08:41] description I've heard of it is it's\n[08:43] like a panic attack but for joy and then\n[08:45] you pulse and pulse and pulse. You think\n[08:47] of your child for example. Think about\n[08:49] that. Think about that. Think about\n[08:50] that. And it's a much sometimes a\n[08:51] quicker way than trying to delete all\n[08:53] thoughts. What's your thoughts on Janna\n[08:55] Surf?\n[08:57] >> The the two things that George is\n[08:59] talking about there. So, at the Vipasa\n[09:01] retreat that I did is 10 days of flood\n[09:04] light meditation where you're you're\n[09:06] scanning with as open focus as possible\n[09:08] and trying to dial up the fidelity of\n[09:10] your sensation so that you can like\n[09:13] start picking up like 10 micro\n[09:15] sensations per second. That's used in a\n[09:18] retreat setting because I've heard it\n[09:20] described as like rubbing bits of flint\n[09:22] together. It's like it needs a lot of\n[09:25] time and momentum to get going and then\n[09:26] it builds the fire. Whereas Janna\n[09:29] meditation is a lot more like\n[09:31] hyperfocused. It's kind of like the\n[09:32] laser beam versus the flood light. Um\n[09:35] I've not achieved Janna. Um I know\n[09:37] George is is is just chilling in Janna\n[09:40] right now. But um yeah, it's it's super\n[09:43] compelling. There's a there's a\n[09:44] movement.\n[09:46] Can you remember the name of it, George?\n[09:47] I think it's the guy who said it's a\n[09:48] panic attack for joy. He's like a tech\n[09:51] founder who was really stressed and now\n[09:53] runs Janna retreats in the States.\n[09:56] >> Yeah, I know who it is, but I've\n[09:57] forgotten the chap's name off the top of\n[09:59] my head.\n[10:00] >> There's a few.\n[10:01] >> He's got a good He's got a good\n[10:02] description of it. And then Michael\n[10:03] Burby as well um has all of his retreats\n[10:07] on YouTube. Um so you can follow along.\n[10:10] >> All right, Seth, you're up. What have\n[10:11] you got?\n[10:13] >> So I have a life hack. However, I think\n[10:16] I need your guys' help. Um because I I'm\n[10:20] struggling to have some kind of\n[10:22] categorization system in order to place\n[10:25] the life hack in. Does that make sense?\n[10:28] >> Go on.\n[10:30] >> So So if you have any suggestions on how\n[10:33] I might categorize the aforementioned\n[10:37] life hacks, that would be\n[10:38] >> Do you feel like Do you feel like some\n[10:39] of them are like physical and some are\n[10:43] digital?\n[10:44] >> Yeah. Yeah,\n[10:50] >> this is a joke. This is a joke. For the\n[10:51] pe for the people who are in the last\n[10:53] 95% of subscribers, this is a joke that\n[10:56] has been done 30 or 40 times,\n[10:58] >> probably. It's like a decade old.\n[11:00] >> Yeah. Yeah. It's getting there. Okay,\n[11:02] first one. Here we go.\n[11:04] >> This is like you mentioned, Chris, about\n[11:05] the curve of the large proportion of\n[11:09] people who are actually just tuned in\n[11:11] now and are just like, what? These guys\n[11:12] are mental. Yeah.\n[11:13] >> So, my hack is use Uber for flights.\n[11:18] >> Use Uber for flights.\n[11:20] >> Honestly, I I cannot believe how easy it\n[11:23] is. So, in the 5 minutes between landing\n[11:27] the plane, getting reception, and\n[11:29] standing up and leaving, I booked my\n[11:32] next flight to Vietnam on Uber on\n[11:35] mobile. It's like it already has your\n[11:38] details and you just go book done and it\n[11:40] gives you Uber credits like 10% for\n[11:42] every flight booked. So the benefit of\n[11:45] this hack is that you're not having to\n[11:47] go through like random airlines and Sky\n[11:49] Scanner or Google Flights or any of that\n[11:52] stuff. It just gives you the best price\n[11:55] with the easiest booking experience. And\n[11:58] they don't charge a markup. I don't know\n[12:00] what the business model is for that part\n[12:03] of Uber unless it's just like lost\n[12:06] leader but brilliant. So I'm never going\n[12:09] back to booking flights any other way.\n[12:11] >> I'm just doing it now. I'm doing it now\n[12:13] on my phone. Uber travel I mean Uber\n[12:15] when you actually look at it the number\n[12:17] of different things that Uber can do is\n[12:20] pretty insane. You can get them to\n[12:21] collect parcels for you. You can get\n[12:24] them to drop off drop off different\n[12:26] stuff.\n[12:27] >> Uh I didn't know that. I did not know\n[12:29] that they did flights. What's the\n[12:30] difference between this and Skyscanner?\n[12:32] Cuz I'm a big Skyscanner stan.\n[12:36] >> As far as I understand, Skyscanner, you\n[12:38] still have to get redirected to the um\n[12:41] airline and then you have to fill in all\n[12:42] your details like four times and your\n[12:44] passport number and all this stuff. So,\n[12:46] like currently I'm in Malaysia, but I've\n[12:49] gone via like Singapore and I'm going\n[12:51] Brisbane, Sydney, Vietnam, Bali, like\n[12:54] through lots of little airports and\n[12:55] stuff and these shitty little airlines\n[12:58] that have websites that barely work and\n[13:01] you're just like trying multiple times\n[13:03] to book it. Like I spent 40 minutes\n[13:06] trying to book something on like Batic\n[13:07] Airlines, couldn't get it working. Uber\n[13:10] 37 quid like took 5 minutes.\n[13:14] >> Wow. free price freeze.\n[13:18] >> Oh yeah. So they they freeze the price\n[13:21] and they let you change the dates\n[13:24] flexibly as well for like\n[13:25] >> So the cost of the price is the cost of\n[13:27] freezing is just £18. Stay safe from\n[13:30] price increases while you plan your\n[13:31] trip.\n[13:34] >> This is really good. This is really\n[13:36] really really [ __ ] good.\n[13:38] >> Top tier life hack it. They also have a\n[13:41] thing where if you book if you book a\n[13:43] flight now\n[13:44] >> and the price drops in between now and\n[13:46] the flight happening, you get the\n[13:48] difference.\n[13:51] >> Wow. Big huck. This is this is You've\n[13:55] really come out of the gate swinging\n[13:56] here. Jesus Christ.\n[14:00] >> This is proof that this might have been\n[14:01] worked.\n[14:02] >> Well, yeah. Unfortunately, Sam Harris\n[14:03] isn't involved in this one.\n[14:05] >> Uh,\n[14:08] okay. Um,\n[14:10] I'm going to go off the back of this\n[14:11] one. Um, just because it it makes the\n[14:13] most sense. Flighty. You go to Flighty?\n[14:16] No.\n[14:17] >> Oh my days. Okay, so I learned this.\n[14:20] >> Are you Flighty Premium, Chris?\n[14:21] >> Of course. [ __ ] Flighty Premium.\n[14:24] Talking to a a flighty veteran here. Uh,\n[14:26] so Flighty is a flight tracking app. And\n[14:31] what it does is it automatically links\n[14:33] in with your calendar, your email inbox.\n[14:35] When you book a flight and the\n[14:37] confirmation comes through, it\n[14:38] automatically loads everything in and it\n[14:41] tells you gate changes, delays, where\n[14:44] your luggage is going to, what terminal\n[14:46] you leave from, what time you're\n[14:48] boarding. It can give you a history of\n[14:50] the last time that the flight all of the\n[14:52] the last 30 days of the flight, how much\n[14:54] it's been delayed, for what reason, if\n[14:56] there's any adjustments that get made.\n[14:58] It'll tell you immediately as well.\n[15:00] While you're in the air, it'll track\n[15:01] your journey and then bring you back\n[15:03] into land. It tracks all of your\n[15:04] previous stuff. It is it's outside. So,\n[15:07] you never need to once you start using\n[15:09] flighty, you will never check another uh\n[15:12] airport board again cuz it's all there\n[15:15] and it gets updated before the board\n[15:17] because the board usually takes a little\n[15:19] bit of time. But this just comes through\n[15:20] from whatever the central hub that's\n[15:22] giving all this information out is. And\n[15:24] uh it's just it's seamless. the number\n[15:26] of times that I have not missed flights,\n[15:30] especially when you've got connections\n[15:31] and it it's outstanding. So, Flighty, I\n[15:34] think premium is maybe 30 bucks a year,\n[15:37] 10 bucks.\n[15:39] >> Super cheap. Um, you can also add\n[15:41] friends, so you can see when your\n[15:43] friends are flying, where they're\n[15:44] flying, if they're delayed as well. So,\n[15:46] you can track all of your friends\n[15:47] flights also. And, uh, it automatically\n[15:50] links in and then it gives you reports\n[15:51] at the end of the year, how long you've\n[15:52] spent being delayed and stuff. There's\n[15:54] some like cool additional things, but\n[15:56] largely never check another advertise,\n[15:59] another um airport board for what gate\n[16:02] am I leaving from? Where's my luggage\n[16:04] gone to? What time do I need to get\n[16:05] there? It's got a little island, a\n[16:07] tracking island, and it also pops up on\n[16:09] your home screen. So, it it's it's\n[16:12] fantastically designed. Everybody that\n[16:14] started using it, I just can't believe\n[16:15] it.\n[16:16] >> So, you get the gate information before\n[16:17] anyone else does.\n[16:18] >> Basically, that's the big the big thing\n[16:19] is gate information plus live island\n[16:21] that sort of tracks everything. M\n[16:23] >> um but you just never have to think\n[16:26] again and it's all automatically linked\n[16:28] in with your emails\n[16:30] >> is\n[16:30] >> Has it changed how early you get to the\n[16:32] airport?\n[16:34] >> Uh not particularly my even for\n[16:37] international now I'm typically getting\n[16:39] to an airport about an hour before I\n[16:40] leave. That has been a high-risisk\n[16:43] strategy but in America you've got TSA\n[16:45] and clear and and things that can fast\n[16:48] track you through security.\n[16:50] What's the spread of um airport arrival\n[16:52] times in this room?\n[16:54] >> I usually arrive about an hour before\n[16:56] I'm going to depart. So, usually about\n[16:57] half an hour before boarding.\n[16:59] >> What about you?\n[17:00] >> Mine's like 90 minutes.\n[17:01] >> Okay.\n[17:03] >> Yeah.\n[17:03] >> For me, it depends where I am. If I'm in\n[17:05] the US, a lot earlier. If I'm in the UK,\n[17:08] a lot later.\n[17:09] >> I feel like if you were at Newcastle\n[17:11] airport, you could arrive 15 minutes\n[17:13] before.\n[17:13] >> Go straight through.\n[17:14] >> If it's Heathrow, you need to go a bit\n[17:16] more time.\n[17:17] >> Yeah. I just always love because\n[17:19] everyone's got like one yolo mate who\n[17:21] just turns up like 15 minutes before and\n[17:23] chances it.\n[17:26] >> Yeah. Unfortunately, America has much\n[17:29] more flux between the size of the cues.\n[17:33] >> The UK is usually pretty consistent\n[17:34] unless you're at Heathrow. Whereas in\n[17:37] Austin, sometimes the entire terminal\n[17:40] has just been filled with people,\n[17:43] >> hundreds of yards of people, and then\n[17:44] other times there's no one. M.\n[17:46] >> So, I don't know whether that's because\n[17:48] the airport needs a bit of work. George,\n[17:50] what have you got for us?\n[17:51] >> I don't think we've spoken about\n[17:52] airlines enough.\n[17:56] Um,\n[17:58] my one I'll go in with um something\n[18:01] different, which is chess clocks.\n[18:06] >> Oh, god.\n[18:07] >> Oh, god. No, no, no, no. Yeah, I know\n[18:10] where he's going to go with So uh it's\n[18:12] one of the ideas I got from uh the\n[18:16] writer Tim Urban who obviously did the\n[18:17] amazing TED talk on procrastination and\n[18:19] then ironically spent like six years\n[18:21] procrastinating on his uh book and he\n[18:25] said the biggest lesson from it was when\n[18:28] it comes to deep work which I've got\n[18:30] another point I'll come on to in a\n[18:31] second but particularly when it comes to\n[18:32] deep work um if you can get four hours\n[18:36] done in a day I think you're in the top\n[18:38] 1%. Um, but a lot of people think, \"Oh,\n[18:41] I work 8 hours a day. I work 10 hours a\n[18:43] day.\" And he found that when it came to\n[18:45] writing the book, he would go to write\n[18:47] it and then other little bits of work\n[18:49] would come up. There'd be a Slack\n[18:50] message here. There'd be a internet\n[18:52] scroll here. So, the chess clock\n[18:54] methodology\n[18:55] is you've essentially set it up where\n[18:58] you have 16 hours in the day. Okay? And\n[19:01] your goal is to get 4 hours on one side\n[19:03] of the chess clock. And whenever you're\n[19:05] doing anything that isn't the thing, you\n[19:08] have to hit it over. So if you go to go\n[19:11] to the bathroom, hit it over. Go for a\n[19:13] walk, hit it over. Somebody comes in,\n[19:15] hit it over. So there's always an\n[19:17] immediate price to [ __ ] or to\n[19:21] distraction. Um, and you realize, oh\n[19:24] wow, first off, when you do 4 hours,\n[19:26] like properly 4 hours, you that is a lot\n[19:28] of time. And then a lot of time you'll\n[19:30] be there at 12:00 p.m. going, \"Wow.\"\n[19:32] Like there's just all this kind of free\n[19:34] time for the rest of the day. If you\n[19:36] don't have a chess clock, like the other\n[19:37] simple approach is to just literally set\n[19:39] an alarm for 4 hours and then anytime\n[19:42] you stop, you have to pause it. So\n[19:44] there's just always it hacks the uh the\n[19:48] kind of brain's circuitry that there's\n[19:50] always some form of punishment for\n[19:52] distraction whereas previously there\n[19:53] isn't. And the amount of times you can\n[19:55] convince yourself you're doing something\n[19:57] that isn't the actual thing is um is\n[20:00] significant. That some I can see that\n[20:02] working for like an external problem\n[20:05] like someone comes in, someone rings\n[20:06] you, email, whatever.\n[20:07] >> But I think the main barrier to deep\n[20:10] work is like an internal. So you're\n[20:12] doing something and then you think, oh,\n[20:14] I just need to\n[20:15] >> do this and you open open a different\n[20:17] window, pause the clock. But it's the\n[20:19] pro the problem for most people, I don't\n[20:21] think, is like I'm aware. I'm distracted\n[20:23] now, but I'll just be distracted.\n[20:25] >> I don't think people are aware that\n[20:26] they're being distracted.\n[20:26] >> Do you not? I think well, this is the\n[20:28] thing about the clock is that it's kind\n[20:30] of they're ticking and you have to be a\n[20:32] little bit more honest. And even then,\n[20:33] I'll be aware of is this a clockw worthy\n[20:36] pause or is this is this actually a\n[20:39] justifiable use of time? So, just having\n[20:42] that there and that punishment there um\n[20:44] is pretty significant.\n[20:45] >> What are your most common debates about\n[20:47] whether it is or is not a clockworthy\n[20:49] pause? Um you filling up a glass of\n[20:52] water can be on there. Um just like all\n[20:55] girlfriends come in, you know what I\n[20:56] mean? It's like little things like that.\n[20:58] But I'll tend to I'll tend to pause the\n[20:59] clock. Yeah.\n[21:01] >> So if you're like if you're writing\n[21:02] >> and you're like, \"Oh, I need to like go\n[21:05] somewhere to get this reference for this\n[21:06] thing.\" And\n[21:08] >> that would be fine. But then if I let's\n[21:10] say for example, I need to go to to a\n[21:12] tweet to find this specific thing.\n[21:14] That's fine. But if I then go on the\n[21:16] newsfeed and start scrolling to change.\n[21:18] So that's where it works. This is why\n[21:19] the clock works really effectively\n[21:21] whereas other techniques it wouldn't\n[21:23] work\n[21:25] >> because because\n[21:26] >> this is great George\n[21:28] >> it is\n[21:28] >> the the other thing that it separates\n[21:30] out is if people think oh it's a it's a\n[21:34] speed thing or it's an efficiency thing\n[21:36] I need to be able to like work faster or\n[21:39] write faster or whatever versus it's\n[21:41] just a not spending enough time on task\n[21:44] thing. Mhm.\n[21:47] >> Yeah, that's a big point that you don't\n[21:50] need to probably be more efficient or\n[21:52] more effective or better or whatever.\n[21:54] You just haven't realized how little\n[21:56] time you're spending doing the thing\n[21:57] you're supposed to be doing.\n[22:00] >> I Yeah, this isn't a hack, but it's\n[22:02] related to this. I have an app on my\n[22:04] laptop that um is like a blocker that\n[22:07] every time I go to like open email, it\n[22:09] goes\n[22:11] cold turkey.\n[22:11] >> It's not cold turkey. similar to that,\n[22:13] but it especially if there's someone\n[22:16] else in the room and they hear how often\n[22:18] it goes. And then you tell them why it's\n[22:20] going uh you just seem like a baby.\n[22:25] >> It's like anytime I try to open email,\n[22:27] iMessage, WhatsApp, uh and you just just\n[22:30] make feel so stupid.\n[22:32] >> Okay. All right, Johnny. Are we on\n[22:34] lessons? Yep. Oh, whatever you want.\n[22:36] Whatever. Take take whatever you want.\n[22:37] >> All right. I'll give it I'll I'll do a\n[22:38] hack that's similar to what we've just\n[22:40] been speaking about, which is brick for\n[22:43] iPhone. You guys seen that?\n[22:45] >> It's a near field communication thing\n[22:47] that you got to tap to unlock your\n[22:48] phone.\n[22:49] >> Mhm.\n[22:50] >> Tried it.\n[22:51] >> I never knew what NFC stands for, Chris.\n[22:53] That's a lovely little\n[22:55] >> There's a hack.\n[22:58] >> I didn't expect you to like describe it\n[23:00] like that. It's a very accurate.\n[23:02] >> Yeah, it's very detailed.\n[23:03] >> You got to tap tap a thing to get your\n[23:05] phone to work.\n[23:06] >> Yeah. So you you you sketch you set like\n[23:08] a schedule on your phone like we've all\n[23:10] tried all these like app blocking things\n[23:12] that you can just ultimately delete the\n[23:13] app.\n[23:14] >> You have to like go to where the thing\n[23:15] is in the house,\n[23:18] >> press unbrick and then tap the NFC\n[23:22] >> device. It's just been the most\n[23:25] effective thing. So as you can I've had\n[23:27] a year of like block trying to block\n[23:29] myself from having to press the chest\n[23:31] cloth. Mhm.\n[23:32] >> Um, and it's been the most effective\n[23:33] thing because having to like stand up,\n[23:38] go into another room, press unbrick, go\n[23:42] and then look at Instagram just not\n[23:44] going to happen\n[23:45] >> cuz I'm still using Opal for two years\n[23:48] ago when you suggested Russell.\n[23:50] >> I just It's just not quite as like cuz\n[23:52] you you can get around that, right?\n[23:54] >> Yeah.\n[23:54] >> There's nothing more I think humiliating\n[23:57] than getting around Opal. I've seen\n[23:59] people do that\n[24:00] >> in front of others. Yeah. Let me just\n[24:02] show you this thing on YouTube. Oh,\n[24:03] wait. No. Hang on. Can you wait for 27\n[24:06] seconds, please?\n[24:06] >> Mhm.\n[24:08] >> Pause session.\n[24:09] >> Did you ever get the the box, Johnny?\n[24:11] >> No.\n[24:12] >> I think it was a Jordan\n[24:14] >> Jordan original, wasn't it?\n[24:15] >> That's putting your phone in a box.\n[24:16] >> George and Kimberly have got a timed\n[24:18] box. Yeah.\n[24:19] >> That you locked both your phones in for\n[24:20] a weekend.\n[24:21] >> Mhm. Yeah. We did it on a um a Saturday.\n[24:25] Put the phones away in the box for the\n[24:28] entire day. It was it was it was fun.\n[24:30] You get incredibly bored. Um and I just\n[24:33] replaced it with a Moleskin notepad.\n[24:35] Right.\n[24:36] >> He walked around he walks around with a\n[24:38] [ __ ] notepad.\n[24:39] >> Not to like he thinks he's Ernest\n[24:41] Hemingway,\n[24:42] >> but that is a one of the best hacks. I\n[24:44] didn't even have this one written down,\n[24:45] which is on the phone topic. Um getting\n[24:48] a Moleskin pocket notepad so it can go\n[24:50] in your pocket. Cuz what's interesting\n[24:52] is this thing here, this thing right\n[24:54] here, this device, it's always\n[24:56] whispering to you. Even now it's saying\n[24:59] scroll, go on this, scroll on that.\n[25:01] >> It's Yeah. Go go go on the the Gmail and\n[25:03] make the sound. Right.\n[25:04] >> And not not George. Not if it's bricked.\n[25:06] >> Not if it's bricked. But even even then\n[25:08] it whispers.\n[25:09] >> You can't access it, but it's still\n[25:10] whispering. It's still telling you to do\n[25:11] it because you have the association. You\n[25:13] have the Pavlovian conditioning with\n[25:14] this device. What's interesting as soon\n[25:17] as you have the Moleskin notepad that\n[25:18] you walk around with is that you then\n[25:21] that then begins to whisper to you. So\n[25:23] when you take it out and you go for a\n[25:25] walk, it's whispering, \"Oh, check page\n[25:27] three. That thing that you wrote down\n[25:28] the other day.\" So having a a Moleskin\n[25:30] notepad is um\n[25:31] >> Can you sit with your thoughts?\n[25:32] >> You could do, but I'm going for a walk\n[25:34] and then I can capture my thoughts. So I\n[25:35] can sit with my thoughts and then I can\n[25:36] capture the best ones. Can you think\n[25:38] about a potential just top of your head?\n[25:42] Potential problem with going from\n[25:44] digital to analog. Uh\n[25:48] you could have written this down in your\n[25:49] phone. Obviously lots of issues. Phone's\n[25:51] very distracting, all the rest of it.\n[25:52] Can you think of perhaps an issue of of\n[25:55] of of having a single hard copy\n[25:58] >> of of your most important thoughts?\n[26:00] >> I suppose losing it.\n[26:02] >> Well, yeah. I mean, cuz it's interesting\n[26:04] you say that. That's a very that's a\n[26:07] very sort of fortuitous prediction. Um\n[26:10] because we went to Dean's Italian and as\n[26:13] you were extolling the virtues of your\n[26:14] Moleskin notepad, you left it at Dean's\n[26:17] Italian and they binned it. So, he lost\n[26:20] all of his biggest thoughts.\n[26:23] Hold on.\n[26:25] So, how does that feel? I saw Chris's\n[26:27] counter move coming about two.\n[26:31] I purposely held off. And I'll explain\n[26:33] why. That wasn't a moleskin notepad.\n[26:37] That was like a like a real [ __ ]\n[26:39] notepad. So, I think the way it was just\n[26:40] bend it cuz it was nothing. That's why I\n[26:42] upgraded now to a moles skin notepad\n[26:44] because if you see a moles skin notepad,\n[26:45] nobody moles skin because of this\n[26:48] reason. if you get a regular mole skin.\n[26:50] >> I actually don't know.\n[26:51] >> It's a brand, isn't it?\n[26:51] >> Yeah, I don't know. It's a brand.\n[26:52] >> Right. So, your your argument\n[26:54] >> really hoping that George is bringing\n[26:55] out like a This is why I have a carbon\n[26:57] copy. Uh\n[26:59] >> this is James Smith taking down the\n[27:00] creatine industry, isn't it?\n[27:02] >> Yeah.\n[27:03] >> So, you're hoping that waiters\n[27:05] understand the value of a Moleskin\n[27:07] notebook versus\n[27:08] >> I'm afraid to tell you. I don't think\n[27:10] >> I don't think they do either.\n[27:12] >> Okay. But the the point I think the\n[27:14] point of these sorts of things is is\n[27:16] >> I remember like you bought a light\n[27:18] phone, didn't you? Years ago, there was\n[27:20] like that movement of buy like a Nokia\n[27:22] 3210 and live your life off that, but\n[27:24] then you need Google Maps and you need\n[27:26] Uber and you need you need to send\n[27:27] someone a message or you need to ring\n[27:28] someone. Having those features is\n[27:30] useful. If your phone's in a box, you\n[27:33] can't use your notepad to book an Uber.\n[27:35] But if you just remove the things that\n[27:37] whisper to you and to to get them active\n[27:41] again, you have to get up and go into\n[27:42] the other room.\n[27:43] >> It's friction increasing friction.\n[27:45] >> Foods in in the in the house that to\n[27:47] prevent you from\n[27:47] >> I do I do remember I had a a lock box\n[27:50] thing, timed lock box, not too\n[27:51] dissimilar to yours, but it had a\n[27:53] plastic see-through cover and there was\n[27:56] little holes cut out of it so you could\n[27:59] actually use the phone. You could swipe\n[28:02] through different things on the phone\n[28:03] and kind of use it,\n[28:04] >> right?\n[28:05] >> But um yeah, didn't you tell me that\n[28:08] >> if you lock your phone in the box, you\n[28:10] have to ring customer service.\n[28:12] >> If you can't get it out, you basically\n[28:14] >> smash it with a hammer. Ring customer\n[28:16] service. Ring customer service cuz you\n[28:17] can accidentally put it on for 30 days\n[28:19] rather than 30 hours. I'm sure I'm sure\n[28:21] somebody's done.\n[28:23] >> It's like\n[28:23] >> Yeah, Mike smashed his with a hammer.\n[28:25] >> Really? So\n[28:28] >> it's just in his in his room thing,\n[28:30] isn't it? There's like a family and they\n[28:32] will put their phones in the box and the\n[28:33] kid ends up like smashing the box.\n[28:35] >> I haven't seen\n[28:35] >> like coded bias or something. All right,\n[28:37] so brick.\n[28:38] >> Brick.\n[28:38] >> All right.\n[28:39] >> An NFC device for it's Opel with a Opal\n[28:43] with a physical thing in it. All right.\n[28:45] In other news, you've probably heard me\n[28:47] talk about Element before, and that's\n[28:48] because I am frankly dependent on it.\n[28:52] Uh, and it's how I've started my day\n[28:54] every single morning.

Uh,\n[30:04] I really underestimated\n[30:07] the potency of the attribution error and\n[30:12] cognitive dissonance. So what I mean by\n[30:14] that is, keep me right on this, Chris,\n[30:16] because I feel like this is your\n[30:18] absolute wheelhouse, that we\n[30:20] overattribute other people's behavior to\n[30:23] their character.\n[30:24] >> Mhm.\n[30:24] >> But we underattribute it to situational\n[30:26] factors. But then for ourselves, we\n[30:29] overattribute situational factors and we\n[30:31] underattribute our character cuz it's\n[30:33] too painful for us to just be like, \"Oh,\n[30:35] just cuz I'm a just a [ __ ] person.\"\n[30:37] Rather than like, \"Oh, it was cuz the\n[30:39] bus was late and cuz whatever.\" but easy\n[30:41] to be like, \"Oh, they were just a dick.\"\n[30:43] And it can't have been that they were\n[30:45] sleepd deprived or looking after their\n[30:48] toddler or whatever else.\n[30:50] >> The classic the classic one is, \"I cut\n[30:51] that guy off because I'm late for work.\n[30:53] He cut me off because he's a bad\n[30:54] driver.\"\n[30:56] >> Oh, yeah. Great example. So the the\n[30:59] broader lesson that I'm seeing here is\n[31:02] um that people are a lot more\n[31:05] emotionally driven than\n[31:09] than I think I've really given it credit\n[31:11] for. Like outside of our extremely\n[31:13] autistic bubble, um there is\n[31:18] there's so much more cognitive\n[31:19] dissonance that drives people's behavior\n[31:21] and thoughts and actions. And so you\n[31:23] know this thing of like people buy with\n[31:25] emotion and they justify with logic.\n[31:27] It's it's not just buying behavior. It's\n[31:30] it's everything. And the moment you\n[31:33] start spotting this, you see it\n[31:34] everywhere. So,\n[31:37] everyone listening must have had an\n[31:38] experience where you're speaking to\n[31:40] someone who has a particular\n[31:43] um stance or gripe or position or\n[31:46] something. Could be on politics, could\n[31:48] be on a relationship issue, whatever.\n[31:51] And the more you start to kind of get\n[31:53] into it, you realize that they're just\n[31:54] rotating their complaint or like they\n[31:57] they're moving goalposts but still being\n[31:59] pissed off about something until you're\n[32:02] like, \"Oh, actually like the pissed-off\n[32:04] comes first and then the justification\n[32:07] >> comes later.\"\n[32:08] >> Um, so it's that people don't actually\n[32:11] want to get to this kind of rational\n[32:14] objective truth. Um, they just want to\n[32:16] feel safe and they just want to hug and\n[32:18] just want to be heard. Um, and so I\n[32:23] don't know who said this, but it's a\n[32:25] quote of we only see what we want to\n[32:27] see. We only hear what we want to hear.\n[32:29] And our belief system is like a mirror\n[32:31] that only shows us what we believe. So\n[32:34] the lens or the glasses that we see the\n[32:36] world through tell us more about the\n[32:38] color of the lens than they do about the\n[32:39] world out there.\n[32:42] I certainly this year since trying to do\n[32:44] more emotions work have sort of come to\n[32:47] the realize or the belief that most of\n[32:49] the thoughts that we have are bottom up\n[32:51] not top down. You feel a thing and then\n[32:53] you come up with a story that explains\n[32:55] why you feel the thing as opposed to\n[32:57] >> and you're accurately determining that\n[33:00] that story from from your brain\n[33:02] downward.\n[33:04] >> It's very convincing as well cuz that\n[33:05] it's what the brain does like it's a\n[33:07] sense making machine isn't it? So the\n[33:08] body goes, \"Oh, I'm anxious. Oh, my\n[33:10] part's going whatever.\" And then it the\n[33:11] brain has to quickly be like, \"Oh, well\n[33:12] that's because this and it just like\n[33:14] pulls together random things and\n[33:16] thoughts to create this like to weave\n[33:18] this narrative and then it holds on to\n[33:20] that and it become it identifies with\n[33:22] it. It's such a like such a weird\n[33:24] process, but it just is happening in the\n[33:26] background all the time.\"\n[33:28] >> How have you changed the way that you\n[33:30] operate or have you applied this in any\n[33:32] way? Is it just an insight that's\n[33:34] interesting philosophically?\n[33:36] just realizing that um there's there's\n[33:39] no point trying to argue with what\n[33:40] someone's saying or trying to like\n[33:42] convince someone on the head level and\n[33:43] instead just like just give them a hug\n[33:45] and or like you know metaphorically and\n[33:48] speak to the heart and um realize that\n[33:52] it's the that that's the stuff to\n[33:54] address first before you get into any of\n[33:56] the um what someone so rather rather\n[34:00] than listening to what someone is saying\n[34:02] listen to what they're feeling. the\n[34:04] there's also this uh like side argument\n[34:07] that people can go down when they touch\n[34:09] that which is that oh uh people are\n[34:11] irrational. They uh they're not logical.\n[34:14] They're driven by emotions. And there's\n[34:16] this great uh account Chris Larkin and\n[34:19] he has this great line which is um\n[34:21] emotions are logical. You're just bad at\n[34:23] logic. And when you actually get deeper\n[34:26] to a a layer of well why is that anger\n[34:28] there or why is that anxiety there? We\n[34:31] almost we start with logic and then\n[34:33] people kind of deny the emotional level.\n[34:35] But then even beneath that there's this\n[34:36] kind of logic for all of those emotions\n[34:39] that exist that we we don't even get\n[34:42] down to the basement and then don't even\n[34:44] get to the point where you realize\n[34:45] there's a basement in the basement.\n[34:48] >> Mhm. All right. My next one.\n[34:50] >> Yeah.\n[34:50] >> My next one. That's good. Uh aala\n[34:54] bottles.\n[34:56] >> Seen one of these?\n[34:57] >> Bottles. No. Seen one of these before?\n[34:58] You've seen one of these. around the\n[34:59] house of this. So, um, everybody needs\n[35:03] some form of water recepticle\n[35:07] and, uh, I've cycled through quite a\n[35:09] bit. I've cled through Yeti.\n[35:10] >> Yeah.\n[35:11] >> Uh, I've used steel protein shakers,\n[35:14] which are good for the protein thing.\n[35:16] Um, the reason that I like these Aala\n[35:18] bottles, this is that's Mark\n[35:20] Zuckerberg's Ranch's logo for you there.\n[35:22] Uh, the reason I like these ones,\n[35:24] they're insulated. Uh, they have got\n[35:26] this size in particular, has got a good\n[35:28] capacity. See, it's going to be 700 700\n[35:30] mil. Uh,\n[35:32] this spout thing here allows you to\n[35:37] sip it like a straw, but also\n[35:42] drink from it. This can hook through\n[35:44] something and hold on and it'll keep\n[35:46] stuff cold for a few hours. It doesn't\n[35:48] look too It comes in every different\n[35:50] color that you can imagine. You can\n[35:51] customize the whole thing. And if you\n[35:53] want to get something printed on for\n[35:54] yourself, off of somebody else that's a\n[35:56] logo or a word or something etched in\n[35:59] it, you can. And it's 20 bucks for one\n[36:02] of these. They're really cheap. Uh\n[36:05] they're they're fantastic and I I adore\n[36:07] mine and I use it all the time. And I\n[36:08] think everyone Yeah, pretty much\n[36:11] everybody from the team's got one. And\n[36:14] it's very satisfying. It's very\n[36:16] satisfying.\n[36:16] >> It looks nice. Is it metal?\n[36:18] >> Yeah,\n[36:20] >> it feels nice. Johnny, have you have you\n[36:22] watched The Office?\n[36:23] >> You know the Christmas special where\n[36:25] David Brent's like a salesman and he's\n[36:27] going around on the road and he's he's\n[36:28] like doing the water off and he's given\n[36:30] the whole pitch. It was literally like\n[36:31] that and I was just expecting you to go\n[36:32] at the end. So, who does your tampons?\n[36:38] >> Well, nice.\n[36:39] >> You know who does your hydration? There\n[36:40] we go.\n[36:41] >> I thought you were I thought everything\n[36:42] was Yeti. You moved away from that.\n[36:45] What? Why are they better than Yeti? Uh\n[36:47] the sip spout, the magic straw or\n[36:50] whatever they call it is really\n[36:52] satisfying. It does make me feel a bit\n[36:54] like a baby.\n[36:55] >> Um which I'll take.\n[36:57] >> Yeah, it is. Okay. Uh Yeti's good. They\n[37:00] probably have better insulation. It'll\n[37:03] keep stuff colder for longer maybe. Uh\n[37:06] but the sizes of Yeti are a little bit\n[37:09] more cumbersome. Can either go from one\n[37:11] that's definitely not big enough to one\n[37:13] that's almost certainly too big. And the\n[37:15] smallest aala size, which is this one,\n[37:18] is really good and fits in the side of\n[37:20] most backpacks. And it's a liter. No, I\n[37:23] think it's 7 just over 700, which is for\n[37:27] a single seven. If you get over a liter,\n[37:28] if you get even over close to what a\n[37:30] liter it you probably don't want to\n[37:32] drink the same thing for that long.\n[37:34] Maybe you want to cycle it out. It gets\n[37:36] heavy. But 500 mil is nowhere near\n[37:38] enough. So, it's the optimal size. This\n[37:40] is currently come back next year when I\n[37:42] disagree with myself.\n[37:44] >> When I have a different phone blocking\n[37:46] method and you have a different bottle,\n[37:50] >> but I'll still be recommending waking\n[37:52] up.\n[37:52] >> Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, anyway,\n[37:54] >> well, this was Johnny's razor that we\n[37:56] left last year's with, which was um come\n[37:58] back to me in 6 months after you've been\n[38:00] using this hack.\n[38:01] >> It's a 90day 90day.\n[38:03] >> Yeah. Well, I guess people won't even\n[38:04] know about that. We did 20 30 episodes\n[38:07] of life hacks back in the day, which is\n[38:09] still like a non- insignificant amount\n[38:12] of this entire podcast inventory. And\n[38:15] one of the most important ones was that\n[38:17] after a while, we realized someone would\n[38:18] come in all full of beans because this\n[38:21] brand new life hack that they were in\n[38:23] love with like, \"Oh, I got I must I must\n[38:26] tell you about a way to get YouTube\n[38:27] Premium for free by getting it through\n[38:28] the Argentinian VPN service.\"\n[38:32] and uh but then you have to wait 90 days\n[38:34] to find out that you get charged back\n[38:36] for fraud online or whatever it might\n[38:39] be.\n[38:39] >> I'd never forget Eric Eric Jorgensson\n[38:42] taught us about that one where if you\n[38:43] try and cancel your Zoom subscription,\n[38:44] they immediately offer you a 30%\n[38:46] discount.\n[38:47] >> Um stuff like that. But the there's some\n[38:50] second order consequence. Oh yeah, but\n[38:52] it's downgraded you. You get ads on your\n[38:54] own Zoom calls now or something. Yeah.\n[38:56] Uh but yeah, anyway, 90 days you if a\n[38:59] friend comes to you, this is a meta life\n[39:01] hack. Friend comes to you and says, \"Me,\n[39:03] you've got to try this new this phone\n[39:05] blocking method and you say, \"Okay, how\n[39:07] long how long have you been doing it?\n[39:08] You are two weeks.\" You go, \"Okay, come\n[39:11] back to me in another two months and\n[39:14] we'll see if you're still using it or if\n[39:15] it's broken your life.\"\n[39:17] I I've had people complain about the\n[39:18] life hacks episodes because they watched\n[39:20] them in order and they would get like\n[39:21] four or five episodes in and the thing\n[39:24] that they'd been doing,\n[39:24] >> you've contradicted yourselves.\n[39:26] >> We were like, \"No, no, never ever do\n[39:27] that. Do this instead.\" And that's just\n[39:28] the cycle. Well, the issue is that the\n[39:30] the pace at which we dripfed Life Hacks\n[39:32] episodes when we started was\n[39:34] appropriate. It was every couple of\n[39:37] months, every 3 months or so for four\n[39:40] years. If you just watch them like binge\n[39:44] finishing Game of Thrones, you do\n[39:46] speedrun through our development.\n[39:49] >> Yeah.\n[39:49] >> Yeah.\n[39:50] >> Which is probably quite a dangerous\n[39:51] >> Don't listen in reverse chronological\n[39:53] order cuz you'll mess yourself up.\n[39:55] >> Oh god.\n[39:55] >> Maybe that's the right way to do it\n[39:56] though.\n[39:57] >> Start at the end.\n[39:58] >> It'll be the stuff at the in the first\n[39:59] episode is probably the things we're all\n[40:00] still doing.\n[40:02] >> It is sleep with the fun outside your\n[40:03] bedroom. All right, George. Um,\n[40:05] >> mine's more of a a lesson or a two-part\n[40:08] lesson. And so one of the lessons this\n[40:10] year was so when I originally uh wrote\n[40:14] the essay on high agency, one of the\n[40:16] bits of feedback that I got and other\n[40:18] people uh gave me as well is that the\n[40:21] concept is not necessarily new, but it\n[40:23] gives you um gives you a bit of language\n[40:25] to refer to a thing. And I've had that\n[40:28] for a while with that term. And I was\n[40:29] like I then went one level above that. I\n[40:31] was like, hold on, I don't have a bit of\n[40:33] language to refer to when I need a bit\n[40:36] of language to refer to something. So um\n[40:38] I told a friend Henrik that and he gave\n[40:40] me from Scott Alexander this uh he calls\n[40:43] it an idea handle which is when you\n[40:45] create a term or a name for a thing and\n[40:46] then you can kind of pick it up in the\n[40:48] world and a big thing for me this year\n[40:50] has been like around language which um\n[40:53] even where you is right now which is\n[40:55] beautiful like side tangent here in\n[40:57] Malaysia they don't use plural so rather\n[41:00] than say tables they they say table\n[41:03] table so you just realize when you study\n[41:05] language so much comes back to you but\n[41:07] one bit of language I've been kind of\n[41:08] playing around with is we've spoken\n[41:10] about this before around forgetting\n[41:12] things and how much we forget. And I\n[41:15] found this story um about a 7-year-old\n[41:18] boy called Henry. And one day he's out\n[41:21] and about playing in his uh drive in\n[41:24] Connecticut and a cyclist doesn't see\n[41:26] him and clatters into him, knocks him\n[41:28] unconscious and he wakes up and the next\n[41:31] few days he starts having a few seizures\n[41:33] and by the age of 25 he's having 25\n[41:36] seizures per day and this is in the 50s.\n[41:40] So he's trying everything to get rid of\n[41:42] this condition. So he goes and signs up\n[41:44] for experimental brain labbotomy surgery\n[41:47] and he wakes up from the operation and\n[41:50] he has some good news, some bad news and\n[41:53] some awful news. So the good news is\n[41:55] that the brain surgery has basically\n[41:58] cured his condition entirely. So he has\n[42:00] no more epileptic fits. The bad news is\n[42:02] that he won't remember the good news\n[42:04] because the awful news is it's destroyed\n[42:06] his ability to form new memories. So he\n[42:08] lives from the age of about 25 to 85 not\n[42:12] forming any new memories. So every day\n[42:14] his psychiatrist would meet him and get\n[42:16] to know Henry well over the years and\n[42:18] each day he would meet his psychiatrist\n[42:19] for the first time. But there was a\n[42:21] specific bit of detail about Henry which\n[42:23] I call Henry's mirror which is every\n[42:25] morning he would wake up. He would look\n[42:28] at himself in the mirror and he'd be\n[42:30] shocked and perplexed at how old he was\n[42:32] because in his head he was always 25.\n[42:35] And I kind of call this idea Henry's\n[42:37] mirror, which is the problem with\n[42:38] amnesia is not only do you forget, it's\n[42:41] that you have amnesia of your amnesia.\n[42:44] And it's this idea that all of us right\n[42:46] now have some bit of Henry's mirror in\n[42:48] us. You don't even realize it because by\n[42:50] definition, you've forgotten it. So the\n[42:52] classic example I use is, okay, Johnny,\n[42:55] can you think of a a clear sentence of\n[42:58] thought from yesterday? Bear in mind,\n[42:59] you had 10 to 70,000 on average. Can you\n[43:01] think of one?\n[43:02] >> No. But when you're in these\n[43:04] overthinking spirals, it feels it feels\n[43:06] so real, feels so tangible, and then it\n[43:08] just fades away, and all you have is a\n[43:10] face that's getting older in the mirror\n[43:12] each day.\n[43:17] It's very apocalyptic.\n[43:20] Before we continue, I've been drinking\n[43:22] AG1 every day for years now because it's\n[43:25] the simplest way that I found to cover\n[43:27] my bases and not overthink nutrition.\n[43:29] And that is why I've partnered with\n[43:31] them. One scoop gives you 75 vitamins,\n[43:34] minerals, probiotics, and whole food\n[43:36] ingredients in a single drink. And now\n[43:38] they've taken it even further with AG1\n[43:40] NextGen. The same one scoop once a day\n[43:42] ritual, but this time backed by four\n[43:44] clinical trials. In those trials, it was\n[43:46] shown to fill common nutrient gaps,\n[43:48] improve key nutrient levels in just 3\n[43:50] months, and increase healthy gut\n[43:51] bacteria by 10 times, even in people who\n[43:54] already eat well. They've upgraded the\n[43:55] formula with better probiotics, more\n[43:57] bioavailable nutrients, and clinical\n[43:59] validation. and it's still NSF certified\n[44:01] for sport, meaning that even Olympic\n[44:03] athletes can use it. Plus, if I ever\n[44:05] actually found something better, I would\n[44:07] switch, but I haven't, which is why I\n[44:09] still use it every day. And if you're on\n[44:11] the fence, they've got a 90-day money\n[44:12] back guarantee. Buy it and try it, and\n[44:14] if you don't love it, they will give you\n[44:15] your money back. Right now, you can get\n[44:17] a free bottle of vitamin D3 K2 free AG1\n[44:20] travel packs, a welcome kit, and that\n[44:22] 90-day money back guarantee by going to\n[44:24] the link in the description below or\n[44:26] heading to drinkagg.com/modernwisdom.\n[44:29] That's drinkaggone.com/modernwisdom.\n[44:33] How has this changed the way that you\n[44:36] show up, if at all?\n[44:41] I think the the big thing I've tried to\n[44:44] change more, first off, when it comes to\n[44:47] overthinking, trying to realize that as\n[44:49] a thought loop's happening, trying to\n[44:51] stare in that mirror for a second and\n[44:52] go, \"Hold on, how long, how many times\n[44:54] has this happened?\" because this could\n[44:56] be the 60,000th time this thought has\n[44:57] happened but I can't remember anything\n[44:58] from yesterday is one thing. The second\n[45:01] thing is just very basic level just\n[45:03] trying to document more. Take more\n[45:04] photos take more videos journal more and\n[45:08] without realizing it's such a an asset\n[45:10] that's going to compound further and\n[45:13] further in the future. Even like today\n[45:15] to be honest with you it's fun that we\n[45:17] get this for like 20 years from now. we\n[45:19] can go, oh, what we was doing that day.\n[45:21] >> But otherwise, like the the average\n[45:22] person,\n[45:23] >> the the memory just goes and then your\n[45:27] life just goes.\n[45:30] >> Yeah.\n[45:30] >> If you use Merry Christmas,\n[45:32] >> Merry Christmas. If you use day one for\n[45:33] journaling, do you guys use day one?\n[45:35] >> You're such a day one. I I do use day\n[45:37] one and I've used it more this year than\n[45:39] any other year.\n[45:39] >> It just gives you every time you go to\n[45:41] make a journal entry, it's like on this\n[45:42] day, a year ago, 2 years ago, 8 years\n[45:44] ago,\n[45:45] >> how many entries have you got on day one\n[45:46] now? I've been using it for like I think\n[45:48] 15 years. Wow.\n[45:49] >> But how frequently are you doing it?\n[45:51] >> I try and do it every day.\n[45:52] >> Really?\n[45:52] >> Yeah. Just like contents of mind and a\n[45:54] picture every day.\n[45:55] >> What's been\n[45:56] >> So you've got thousands of entries. Holy\n[45:58] [ __ ]\n[45:58] >> But the thing the main takeaway from all\n[46:00] of it is like\n[46:01] >> it's just the same stuff. It's just the\n[46:03] same\n[46:04] >> the same worries, the same things you're\n[46:06] excited about, the same feelings 10\n[46:08] years ago. You're like, what's the\n[46:10] point? Well, we assume that the Henry's\n[46:13] mirror thing is is true in as much as\n[46:15] all of the problems that we're dealing\n[46:16] with now feel fresh to us.\n[46:19] >> Mhm. But when you look across the\n[46:23] expanse of time,\n[46:26] in the same ways you've got the same\n[46:27] feet that you did 10 years ago, your\n[46:29] psychological construction is made up of\n[46:31] the same biases and fundamental fears,\n[46:34] which I think you to your sort of\n[46:36] emotions point is why that's such a\n[46:38] powerful way to communicate with people.\n[46:40] And also the uh it's why I've been\n[46:43] trying to dig deeper sort of even deeper\n[46:46] than just talk therapy gets you to by\n[46:49] unpacking okay and where are these\n[46:51] patterns coming from and what what is\n[46:53] this what are the emotions I'm\n[46:54] unprepared to feel because I think that\n[46:57] is really the only way to get to the\n[46:58] bottom of the etcher sketch and to fully\n[47:00] fully shake it loose.\n[47:02] you you're right that you're the same\n[47:04] you're obviously the same person that\n[47:05] you were 15 20 years ago but last year\n[47:08] we we talked about this where you you\n[47:11] think that your journal especially in\n[47:13] Johnny's case we've got 15 years of day\n[47:15] one journals is going to be useless in\n[47:17] like the very early stages what does my\n[47:19] 19-year-old idiot self know about how I\n[47:22] should be conducting my life now and\n[47:24] then you look back on it and it's just\n[47:26] exactly the same stuff that you're like\n[47:28] oh god and it's like life is a spiral\n[47:32] curriculum and it'll keep spanking you\n[47:36] with the same lessons until you finally\n[47:38] absorb it, change what you're doing and\n[47:41] then the world around you will stop like\n[47:44] hitting you with that same lesson.\n[47:45] >> What's that? Is it uh young uh until you\n[47:48] make the unconscious conscious it will\n[47:50] direct your life and you will call it\n[47:52] fate\n[47:53] >> that\n[47:54] >> and we we see that often with other\n[47:56] people more clearly you know when you\n[47:58] see someone who's always running into\n[47:59] the same like style of problem and you\n[48:01] like oh yeah it's cuz they're creating\n[48:03] it.\n[48:04] >> So one um one hack for this it was\n[48:07] actually one of mine for today but\n[48:09] whilst it's on the topic is kind of what\n[48:12] I call like this uh time technique. So\n[48:16] let's say for example you're going\n[48:17] through insert difficult uh moment. So\n[48:20] let's say I don't know you're going\n[48:22] through a breakup or you're having in\n[48:24] your case Johnny maybe a difficult issue\n[48:25] with a member of staff or um you say\n[48:28] about my members of staff.\n[48:29] >> No you know what I mean like running a\n[48:30] business you're going to you're going to\n[48:31] have those don't sue me um you're going\n[48:34] to have those issues. So what I kind of\n[48:37] recommend or I've been doing this one\n[48:38] for three or four years, which is I'll\n[48:40] think of, okay, so let's say it's a uh a\n[48:42] work conflict, right? I will then go,\n[48:45] okay, can I think of two or three times\n[48:48] that are the most similar throughout my\n[48:50] entire career like this? So, I kind of\n[48:53] write down those events and write down\n[48:55] the date. And then I ask, okay, if I\n[48:58] could uh go back in time now with all\n[49:00] the knowledge that I have now, and if I\n[49:03] could turn this event into like one of\n[49:05] the best things that ever happened to\n[49:06] me, what would be the three actions that\n[49:07] I would take? I go, okay. And then next\n[49:10] to the date, I write, okay, well, what\n[49:12] would be the worst three things that I\n[49:14] could do with all the knowledge that I\n[49:15] have now? Cuz you you have this\n[49:16] detachment from the event and you have\n[49:18] like an extra uh 20 IQ points. And then\n[49:22] once you've done that, just scribble out\n[49:23] the date and replace it with today's\n[49:25] date and pretend it's you from the\n[49:27] future that's that's come back. And\n[49:29] that's such a an effective way because\n[49:31] when you do, even though we do forget so\n[49:33] much of the past, the real stuff that\n[49:34] you do remember are the most emotional\n[49:36] events and even now you can look back at\n[49:37] things 5 to 10 years ago and have such\n[49:40] um detachment. Well, the patterns are\n[49:43] the same, which means that the solutions\n[49:45] will probably still work. If you can\n[49:47] think of what you would have done\n[49:48] previously in a situation that's\n[49:50] analogous and now you in the present are\n[49:54] facing something similar.\n[49:56] >> Yeah, it is.\n[49:57] >> I love you\n[49:58] >> cuz that that's what emotions are\n[50:00] supposed to do, aren't they? They're\n[50:01] supposed to be a navigation tool as\n[50:03] feedback for oh, you took a wrong step\n[50:05] there. Like here's how to change in\n[50:08] future. But we often don't and then keep\n[50:10] experiencing the emotion.\n[50:11] >> Yeah. The the universe just continues to\n[50:13] shout louder until you hear the lesson.\n[50:15] And the goal is to get before it's\n[50:17] screaming in your face. The goal is to\n[50:19] try and jump jump that a little bit\n[50:20] sooner. All right, Johnny. What you got?\n[50:22] >> John.\n[50:23] >> John.\n[50:24] >> Uh, I have a lesson which ties in\n[50:26] beautifully with this.\n[50:27] >> Wonderful.\n[50:28] >> Because one of the problems with having\n[50:33] 15 years of journals is I can I watch I\n[50:37] I can see this like journey of me\n[50:40] chasing all these little things. So like\n[50:42] I wanted to bench 100 kilos and then I\n[50:45] wanted abs and then I wanted a 21 degree\n[50:48] and I wanted a job and then I wanted\n[50:51] propane to do well and I wanted certain\n[50:52] revenue levels and it's always just this\n[50:55] next thing. You can see it happening\n[50:57] through the journal entries and you\n[50:59] realize\n[51:01] >> it changes nothing. Like there in those\n[51:04] same entries there's still worries,\n[51:07] problems, the same worries, the same\n[51:08] problems. And you watch you through time\n[51:11] achieve these things and you're still\n[51:13] worried about the same stuff. And that\n[51:14] creates this feeling of like what is the\n[51:17] point of display anything? But the the\n[51:20] thing that you realize woven into all of\n[51:22] it is the thing that's changing the\n[51:24] whole time is the like the traits that\n[51:28] are that are you and how your character\n[51:30] is changing because chasing those things\n[51:32] that are difficult require like delayed\n[51:36] gratification. They require like dealing\n[51:38] with difficult difficult emotions. They\n[51:40] require like\n[51:42] all of the skills that you have to build\n[51:44] and all of the traits you have to build\n[51:46] to build a business to a certain level\n[51:47] or to diet for the the leanest you ever\n[51:50] been, whatever it might be, you you\n[51:53] change. So, it's this idea that like the\n[51:55] goals, I don't think they really\n[51:56] compound. They kind of do, but they like\n[51:58] the dopamine you get from that doesn't\n[51:59] compound, but the traits that you get\n[52:00] from chasing the hard things is the\n[52:02] compounding. And that immediation\n[52:06] immediately flipped back to like it's\n[52:07] absolutely worth like listing out loads\n[52:10] of really big difficult goals and\n[52:11] chasing them because the I don't think\n[52:14] there's any faster way\n[52:16] to change who you are to improve your\n[52:18] and it's something that like being a my\n[52:22] daughter is now of an age where like\n[52:23] she's she's gone from being a baby to\n[52:25] being like a little person and I'm like\n[52:27] oh god like there's a proper like\n[52:29] responsibility here to be the example\n[52:32] and I think And the best way to become\n[52:34] the example is chase the difficult\n[52:37] things that require the traits to to\n[52:40] come as part of the journey.\n[52:43] >> I love the um what your take away from\n[52:47] that, Johnny, cuz some people would be\n[52:48] really nihilistic about that. They oh\n[52:51] well there's no point chasing anything.\n[52:52] >> That's the first feeling. The first\n[52:53] feeling is like oh what's the point?\n[52:57] >> Yeah. whereas you're like actually this\n[53:00] is a way to play the game without having\n[53:02] to be fully sucked into the game.\n[53:05] >> Well, you still need to be conned by the\n[53:07] game into believing that the game is\n[53:08] what you want to play. Like this\n[53:10] wouldn't work. You would not be able to\n[53:12] get yourself to do the hard thing if you\n[53:13] didn't think that the other side of the\n[53:15] goal of the hard thing was\n[53:18] completion, satisfaction,\n[53:20] self-actualization,\n[53:22] rest.\n[53:22] >> But I think people think, \"Oh, when I\n[53:24] get a million turnover, I'll be happy.\n[53:27] That's not true.\n[53:29] >> But when you get a million turnover, the\n[53:30] person\n[53:31] >> the person that you've become.\n[53:32] >> Yeah. And so you just change the thing,\n[53:34] the goal is kind of like the side quest\n[53:36] to the thing.\n[53:37] >> But that's the thin end of the wedge.\n[53:39] The goal is what gets you through the\n[53:40] door.\n[53:40] >> Yeah.\n[53:41] >> Because you're not thinking I can't wait\n[53:43] to feel dissatisfied in this goal, but\n[53:45] happy about the person I've become.\n[53:47] >> Yeah. Like you achieve the goal, you get\n[53:48] the little like it's the James Smith\n[53:50] thing like Winsfield. It feels exactly\n[53:51] the same.\n[53:52] >> Yep. Then you're dissatisfied\n[53:53] >> but you've changed. The thing is you\n[53:55] can't you don't know that at the time\n[53:57] >> and the only way you can know that\n[54:00] >> is those is like being able to see what\n[54:02] you two years ago how you two years ago\n[54:04] dealt with a challenge or dealt with.\n[54:06] >> I think this is why progress feels so\n[54:08] good and losing ground feels so bad\n[54:13] >> that this this is great for you somebody\n[54:16] who's been on a relatively linear\n[54:17] journey of getting better, more mindful,\n[54:20] more peaceful, more successful, more\n[54:21] capable, more resilient, whatever. But\n[54:24] if the thing happens in the opposite\n[54:26] direction, whether you've achieved your\n[54:27] goals or not, even maybe worse if you've\n[54:29] achieved your goals, you say, \"I got the\n[54:32] thing I thought I wanted.\n[54:35] It turns out that just as you was a bit\n[54:39] disappointed with how much that didn't\n[54:41] satisfy me. Oh, [ __ ] And I'm now a\n[54:44] worse person in some sort of a way.\" You\n[54:47] know, you're a boxer who gets the\n[54:49] Olympic gold medalist. gold medal uh\n[54:52] gets [ __ ] head injury uh and now has\n[54:56] to deal with that. Also, I'm unhappy\n[54:59] about the fact that the gold medal\n[55:00] didn't make me as happy as I thought it\n[55:01] would and I'm now worse off.\n[55:05] >> Well, and Henry's mirror like you've\n[55:07] wasted time in the process.\n[55:11] >> Is that just\n[55:11] >> like you're now 85\n[55:13] >> just because of the brain injury and\n[55:14] that?\n[55:15] >> Yes. Yeah. The point being that the\n[55:16] saving grace you have around goals being\n[55:18] more unsatisfying than people think\n[55:20] they're going to be is that you have\n[55:22] transformed yourself into something\n[55:24] which is more evergreen\n[55:27] than the goal and the brief drip of\n[55:29] dopamine which is all internal anyway\n[55:31] >> uh than than that is you've got\n[55:33] something more than that and hooray but\n[55:35] imagine if you didn't get the progress\n[55:37] so I'd argue that aside from becoming\n[55:40] like severely injured or disabled or\n[55:42] some in the process dealing with the\n[55:44] hard things is where the trait changes\n[55:47] happen. So at the you can go through the\n[55:49] the thing that feels like I'm going\n[55:50] backwards and at the time yes you're\n[55:52] like objectively going backwards by the\n[55:54] measure by the revenue level the body\n[55:57] fat whatever the strength level but the\n[55:59] traits are still improving\n[56:01] >> because I think anything extremely\n[56:02] >> what about if you ran out of motivation\n[56:04] what about if you dumped all of your uh\n[56:06] enthusiasm into something that it turned\n[56:08] out wasn't wasn't right\n[56:10] >> that's assuming that that's the end\n[56:12] point that might just be halfway\n[56:14] >> your your position here is that given a\n[56:16] long enough time horizon is and you're\n[56:17] going to track and trend up and to the\n[56:19] right.\n[56:20] >> Yeah. Like if you look at look at your\n[56:22] journey to here as an example like you\n[56:26] sat on this sofa\n[56:28] how many 5 years ago six eight years ago\n[56:31] >> eight years ago\n[56:32] >> like if you watch the recordings back I\n[56:35] do\n[56:35] >> you seem\n[56:36] >> completely different\n[56:38] >> and everybody would be like oh Chris is\n[56:40] you know what a what a fantastic\n[56:41] existence Chris must have like being\n[56:43] this famous podcaster but the that's\n[56:46] really the side quest to the\n[56:48] >> the development as a as a result of It's\n[56:50] a good part. I mean, what was the first\n[56:52] one that we filmed? Love Island. Love\n[56:54] Island. What's it really like to live on\n[56:55] Love Island?\n[56:57] >> 17.\n[56:59] >> 14. Episode 14. So, uh, yeah, we were\n[57:02] sat on a different couch, but the same\n[57:04] living room.\n[57:06] >> Uh, in\n[57:08] May, April or May of 2018,\n[57:12] uh, different couch. Definitely a\n[57:13] different couch.\n[57:15] >> Leather couch.\n[57:16] >> Yeah.\n[57:16] >> Um, and yeah, you're right. You're right\n[57:18] that that it's I want to be in a\n[57:22] different country. I want to not have to\n[57:24] stay awake till 3 in the morning running\n[57:25] nightclubs. I want people that I respect\n[57:28] to know me and respect my work. I want d\n[57:32] and then you go okay at each of those\n[57:34] junctures they were satisfying but the\n[57:36] satisfaction was shortlived. What was\n[57:37] longer lived while the person that you\n[57:39] became?\n[57:39] >> So do you think if you'd picked So the\n[57:41] goal you had was I know it wasn't like\n[57:43] explicitly the goal at the time but the\n[57:44] goal was like I'm going to build a top\n[57:45] 10 podcast in the world. It was not\n[57:47] that.\n[57:47] >> No. Yeah. Just to give a big asterisk\n[57:49] there. We we was on a beach during co um\n[57:55] >> and\n[57:55] >> this would have been 2 and a half years\n[57:56] into the podcast. So not not an\n[57:58] insignificant amount of time.\n[57:59] >> Yeah. And Chris just said if we're\n[58:01] talking about goals and where he wants\n[58:02] to take things. He goes kind of pauses\n[58:05] for a second. He goes I think I think\n[58:08] 100,000 subscribers. I think as soon as\n[58:09] I get that I'll just chill out.\n[58:11] >> I'll be happy then. I remember his whole\n[58:14] production staff's enjoy got 100,000\n[58:16] now.\n[58:17] >> I I remember when I was first year of\n[58:21] university\n[58:22] >> and I remember buying a tub of protein\n[58:26] and looking at it and thinking after\n[58:28] this one I think I'll be done.\n[58:33] >> Do you think Do you think\n[58:34] >> I was 18 and weighed about 76 kilos?\n[58:38] >> But it was that it was\n[58:39] >> No, sorry. 69. I was 69 kilos. [ __ ]\n[58:42] hell. I remember when I hit 70 kilos and\n[58:44] I was 20 years old and I was like, I am\n[58:45] [ __ ] huge.\n[58:47] >> I I think if you'd picked an easier\n[58:49] goal, your development would have been\n[58:52] totally different.\n[58:53] >> But this is a big this is a big homosism\n[58:55] where he says um the person that you\n[58:58] become along the way, like how can you\n[58:59] say that you're a man who can do hard\n[59:01] things if you never did hard things?\n[59:03] >> Then Jimmy Carr repurposed it even\n[59:04] better. And it's yeah this insight I\n[59:07] think is it is a saving grace to a lot\n[59:10] of people who feel that their goals are\n[59:11] hollow.\n[59:12] >> Mhm.\n[59:12] >> Um so I think that's a a wonderful\n[59:15] lesson like a really really lovely\n[59:16] lesson. All right yousef what you got?\n[59:18] >> Yeah\n[59:19] >> think of how many bags of protein you've\n[59:21] eaten since then Chris. Um you did the\n[59:24] same with balloons as well didn't you?\n[59:25] Where like thousand subscribers you and\n[59:28] Dean had a like cake and balloons and a\n[59:30] party. Each each sub subscriber level\n[59:33] has got bigger and less grand in its\n[59:36] celebration. Yeah.\n[59:38] >> Did we even do\n[59:38] >> number of billions less\n[59:40] >> for four million subs? We didn't do\n[59:42] >> we did something for a billion.\n[59:44] >> We did we did something for a billion\n[59:45] plays but yeah for 4 million subs I\n[59:47] don't think it even registered. Well, it\n[59:49] did. We like ah well we we need to get a\n[59:51] piece of artwork and do that. We did for\n[59:52] the eighth in the world. Eighth in the\n[59:53] world I had a what was supposed to be a\n[59:56] red velvet cake but it wasn't. It was a\n[59:57] carrot cake masquerading as a red velvet\n[59:59] cake and it was awful. It was horrible.\n[01:00:02] I tried I tried to eat it in Utah. It\n[01:00:04] didn't go well.\n[01:00:04] >> It's crazy to think.\n[01:00:07] >> Yeah.\n[01:00:08] >> It's crazy to think for like a 100,000\n[01:00:10] you did this mega party and then for 4\n[01:00:12] million years\n[01:00:12] >> you probably just sent a bicep emoji on\n[01:00:14] Slack.\n[01:00:15] >> That's it. Yeah. Probably the Pornhub\n[01:00:16] the Pornhub emoji. Yeah. On Slack.\n[01:00:20] >> A quick aside, trust really is\n[01:00:22] everything when it comes to supplements.\n[01:00:23] A lot of brands may say that they are\n[01:00:25] top quality, but very few can actually\n[01:00:26] prove it, which is why I partnered with\n[01:00:28] Momentus. They make the highest quality\n[01:00:30] supplements on the planet and their whey\n[01:00:32] protein is literally the cleanest on the\n[01:00:34] market. It's fast absorbing isolate\n[01:00:36] sourced from grass-fed European cows,\n[01:00:38] which means no hormones, no antibiotics,\n[01:00:41] no GMOs. Plus, it's NSF certified,\n[01:00:43] meaning that even Olympians can use it.\n[01:00:44] And unlike most proteins, it's designed\n[01:00:46] for gut health. No fillers, no junk, low\n[01:00:49] in lactose, and it mixes amazingly. This\n[01:00:52] is fantastic. Clean protein usually\n[01:00:53] tastes awful, and this is unbelievable.\n[01:00:55] Best of all, there's a 30-day money back\n[01:00:56] guarantee, so you can buy it completely\n[01:00:58] risk-f free.

All right,\n[01:01:17] Z, what you got?\n[01:01:19] >> So, ju just to piggyback off Johnny's\n[01:01:21] there, cuz I really like the takeaway of\n[01:01:22] like the person that you become. Um, I\n[01:01:25] think there's another thing that you can\n[01:01:26] draw from that, too. I fully agree, but\n[01:01:29] um you were talking about like chewing\n[01:01:32] on the menu. So mistaking the menu for\n[01:01:35] the meal and\n[01:01:37] ascribing that as the to to to your\n[01:01:40] happiness.\n[01:01:42] And we're the ones that always move the\n[01:01:43] goalposts for our happiness every time\n[01:01:45] we hit a particular milestone. And we\n[01:01:48] renegotiate the contract with our brain.\n[01:01:50] So that we end up in this trap where you\n[01:01:52] know that your brain releasing a little\n[01:01:53] bips of of some neurotransmitter but you\n[01:01:57] raise the bar of oh but it has to be\n[01:01:59] have to achieve an even higher bar to to\n[01:02:01] get the same little blurt of dopamine.\n[01:02:04] Um, and a lot of it's because we almost\n[01:02:08] feel like it's too simple to just enjoy\n[01:02:10] the basic pleasures of life that are\n[01:02:12] immediately available of health and\n[01:02:15] relationships and nature and the sun and\n[01:02:18] friends and things that um you would\n[01:02:22] like if they were taken away from you,\n[01:02:24] you would actually want to exchange\n[01:02:26] everything for that. So there's a\n[01:02:28] there's a book by a media giant who\n[01:02:30] wrote I he came up he was like the head\n[01:02:33] of PC World magazine and a bunch of\n[01:02:35] conglomerates\n[01:02:37] called it's called Fel Felix Dennis uh\n[01:02:41] how to get rich and it's like a\n[01:02:43] tongue-in-cheek book about like he's I'm\n[01:02:45] sat here at the age of 84 um writing um\n[01:02:49] this book to you dear reader who's um\n[01:02:52] you know probably in your 20s or 30s and\n[01:02:56] despite the billions that I've amassed,\n[01:02:58] I would swap places with you in an\n[01:02:59] instant because you have the one thing\n[01:03:01] that I don't, which is time, and I would\n[01:03:03] still have the better end of the deal.\n[01:03:05] Um, so it's almost like that the things\n[01:03:08] that we're chasing,\n[01:03:10] like most people listening to this\n[01:03:12] podcast are probably in the top like 20%\n[01:03:14] of global wealth anyway.\n[01:03:18] And yet we think that if we get to the\n[01:03:20] top 19% or the top 18% or whatever, that\n[01:03:22] something's going to change. Um, I saw\n[01:03:25] Ferris shared this quote from Marian\n[01:03:27] Seldes the other day. The hardest thing\n[01:03:29] to teach a student and to believe\n[01:03:31] consistently is that there is nothing\n[01:03:34] out there to go and get. There is no\n[01:03:35] part career opportunity for which you\n[01:03:38] should be searching and scrging and\n[01:03:39] coveting. All of the preparation is\n[01:03:41] within. And if you keep yourself\n[01:03:42] mentally and physically fit and you\n[01:03:44] remain generous with yourself and others\n[01:03:46] and stay deeply in your study about your\n[01:03:48] your craft, whatever is yours will then\n[01:03:50] arrive. So\n[01:03:53] with that in mind, it's like there are\n[01:03:56] basic pleasures that are always\n[01:03:58] available and when they're gone, like\n[01:04:01] health for example, when that's\n[01:04:02] challenge, we've all I think all of us\n[01:04:03] have gone through some health challenge\n[01:04:04] in the last like 10 years where we've\n[01:04:06] suddenly been like, oh wow,\n[01:04:08] >> actually I could really do with a bit\n[01:04:10] more of that again. Um, so instead it's\n[01:04:13] like enjoy those pleasures and then\n[01:04:15] organize your life such that you can\n[01:04:17] enjoy the passage of time as you move\n[01:04:19] towards your goal and then you've got\n[01:04:21] the best of both worlds.\n[01:04:24] I think this is\n[01:04:26] it might sound too it's probably almost\n[01:04:29] certainly would have sounded to us eight\n[01:04:31] years ago when we started the pod\n[01:04:34] opulent maybe entitled\n[01:04:38] detached from reality in some sort. Why?\n[01:04:40] Why just get stronger, bigger, more\n[01:04:43] rich, more popular, whatever. Um, why\n[01:04:47] you needing to make everything so\n[01:04:49] abstract? But this leads into my\n[01:04:51] favorite my favorite lesson from the\n[01:04:53] entire year, which is that unteable\n[01:04:55] lessons are unteable. And this has been\n[01:04:58] the best essay. I wrote it in January\n[01:05:00] and then dropped it on Rogan a couple of\n[01:05:02] weeks after that. And it's still just\n[01:05:05] it's a fundamental truism that\n[01:05:09] there are a particular category of\n[01:05:11] insights about life that you cannot\n[01:05:14] learn without experiencing. And money\n[01:05:17] won't make you happy. Fame won't fix\n[01:05:19] your self worth. You don't love that\n[01:05:20] pretty girl. She's just hot and\n[01:05:21] difficult to get. You should see your\n[01:05:23] parents more. You should work less. You\n[01:05:25] should spend more time in a hammock. You\n[01:05:26] should enjoy a holiday without having\n[01:05:28] your phone. You'll never care about\n[01:05:30] anything that you're thinking of apart\n[01:05:31] from when you're thinking about it. Like\n[01:05:33] all of these lessons over and over, the\n[01:05:35] next follower account won't matter. The\n[01:05:38] reason that people proclaim them with\n[01:05:42] such like grandio ceremony when they get\n[01:05:45] there is that they can't believe that\n[01:05:48] that was the case. Despite the fact that\n[01:05:50] generations of parents and media and\n[01:05:53] literature and archetype and myth and\n[01:05:56] songs and art have told us, here are the\n[01:06:00] pitfalls to look out for. And it's this\n[01:06:02] weird kind of like cute narcissism that\n[01:06:05] we all have where we think that that\n[01:06:07] might be true for them but not for me.\n[01:06:10] My particular\n[01:06:11] >> it's the like, oh, shut up granddad.\n[01:06:14] Like I'll figure it out myself.\n[01:06:16] >> Yeah. My unique constitution would allow\n[01:06:18] me to dance through this minefield of\n[01:06:20] very wellladen, very wellcribed trip\n[01:06:23] wires, and I won't trip on any of them.\n[01:06:25] So, I'm working on uh the next build of\n[01:06:28] this unteachable lessons thing cuz I\n[01:06:29] think it's so good. Um, one of the So,\n[01:06:33] first off, I guess you are if you chase\n[01:06:37] something that you were warned was\n[01:06:38] hollow to arrive there and find out that\n[01:06:41] the warning was correct,\n[01:06:44] you were in good company. That's the\n[01:06:46] first lesson of the unteachable lessons\n[01:06:48] thing. But the second one is that they\n[01:06:50] are unteachable. So the self-castigation\n[01:06:54] of I should have known what I didn't\n[01:06:57] know before I knew it. Like I should\n[01:07:01] have seen this thing coming or whatever.\n[01:07:04] I that is simply not the way this the\n[01:07:06] unteable lessons are self-reinforcing.\n[01:07:10] They are unteachable which means you\n[01:07:12] have to do them in order to be able to\n[01:07:13] understand them. And I think this is\n[01:07:15] what maybe a good bit of us are\n[01:07:18] reckoning with now. That unteable\n[01:07:19] lessons don't really matter all that\n[01:07:21] much until you're at the stage where\n[01:07:23] you've learned that the lesson should\n[01:07:27] have been realized in advance and you\n[01:07:31] knew about it. And then you get this\n[01:07:32] guilt and you get the shame around, well\n[01:07:34] [ __ ] hell. How could I not have did\n[01:07:37] the guys not tell me? Did they not say\n[01:07:39] that the 4 million subs wasn't the\n[01:07:41] answer? D so on and duh duh and um I\n[01:07:45] think what I realized was unteable\n[01:07:48] lessons is is cool to point at but\n[01:07:49] doesn't actually give anybody any sense\n[01:07:51] of all it does is mark the way to the\n[01:07:55] edge of the cliff that they are going to\n[01:07:58] jump off of and on your way down you'll\n[01:08:01] realize that you're in okay company so\n[01:08:02] maybe you feel a bit less lonely but the\n[01:08:04] next one is\n[01:08:06] you can't realize this stuff before\n[01:08:10] you've experienced it. And because of\n[01:08:12] that, you shouldn't be whipping yourself\n[01:08:15] into like pain and and saying, \"What an\n[01:08:18] idiot. I shouldn't have done this.\" It's\n[01:08:20] a a justification for self-compassion.\n[01:08:23] That way smarter, way richer, way more\n[01:08:26] accomplished, more worldly people who\n[01:08:28] had more advantages than you,\n[01:08:31] knew more, and did the exact same thing.\n[01:08:34] Bigger for longer till the end of their\n[01:08:36] life. They died trying to do it. And\n[01:08:38] okay, like it you you dedicated however\n[01:08:42] many weeks, months, years, decades to\n[01:08:44] this career, relationship, pursuit,\n[01:08:47] goal, dream, whatever it might be, to\n[01:08:49] find out that what was at the end of the\n[01:08:51] rainbow wasn't a part of gold.\n[01:08:54] >> You're in good company.\n[01:08:55] >> Well, it's not programming. Like, you\n[01:08:56] can't just take it on faith, otherwise\n[01:08:58] you'll be sat there with FOMO.\n[01:08:59] >> Yeah.\n[01:09:00] >> Yeah. It's the Naval thing. It's far\n[01:09:01] easier to achieve your material desires\n[01:09:03] than to renounce them. I think it's like\n[01:09:04] the best reason to achieve them,\n[01:09:06] >> to clear them off 100%. It's way easier,\n[01:09:08] and this sounds like a thing to say,\n[01:09:11] >> but\n[01:09:13] demonetized. Um,\n[01:09:16] uh, it's it's literally easier to buy a\n[01:09:19] Ferrari than it is to rid yourself of\n[01:09:21] the desire to get a Ferrari.\n[01:09:23] >> Yeah, it's\n[01:09:24] >> that that doesn't speak to how easy it\n[01:09:26] is to get a Ferrari. It speaks to how\n[01:09:28] difficult it is to be able to rid\n[01:09:29] yourself of the desire for a Ferrari if\n[01:09:31] you really become in be in being able to\n[01:09:33] get the Ferrari in the first place,\n[01:09:34] isn't it?\n[01:09:35] >> Yeah.\n[01:09:36] >> But yeah, I think like a really bad\n[01:09:37] credit rating.\n[01:09:40] >> Yeah, true,\n[01:09:40] >> [ __ ]\n[01:09:41] >> The um\n[01:09:42] >> I I think like if if by\n[01:09:44] >> big naturals\n[01:09:45] >> gaining a certain amount of money, you\n[01:09:47] remove your desire to get more money.\n[01:09:49] >> Fantastic.\n[01:09:50] >> The quickest the quickest route to\n[01:09:52] getting rid of the desire is to achieve\n[01:09:53] it.\n[01:09:53] >> Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Um, what have I got\n[01:09:57] next? Uh, you know, oh, one we've\n[01:09:59] discussed before actually, um, not on\n[01:10:01] the show. So, you spoke then about\n[01:10:04] giving up desires. Uh, another problem\n[01:10:07] is is envy or jealousy. And I've, one of\n[01:10:11] the things I've tried to do rather than\n[01:10:13] give up envy or jealousy is have a bit\n[01:10:15] more of a stricter criteria of when I'm\n[01:10:17] willing to be envy or jealous. So what I\n[01:10:20] kind of developed is this idea I call\n[01:10:22] Call of Duty versus War. So Call of Duty\n[01:10:26] is kind of what I project Johnny's life\n[01:10:28] to be be like, right? Like maybe some of\n[01:10:30] the highlights that I hear and the wins\n[01:10:32] and all of that stuff. And then the war\n[01:10:34] is okay when I've actually been with you\n[01:10:36] for a week and lived your life. If I'm\n[01:10:39] envious of the war, then that's fine.\n[01:10:42] But if I'm envious of this Call of Duty\n[01:10:44] 1% highlight reel that doesn't exist,\n[01:10:46] then that's a problem. So I use I mean I\n[01:10:49] use two examples. I mean one of them is\n[01:10:51] um uh is a a business guy we both know\n[01:10:56] super super super successful and he's\n[01:10:59] got everything beautiful family amazing\n[01:11:01] business um crushing it year on year and\n[01:11:04] he's got to the scale now where we're\n[01:11:06] talking it's a huge mega business. I was\n[01:11:07] with him. You could easily feel envious.\n[01:11:09] He goes, \"Yeah, I've got um I think it\n[01:11:11] was 2,000 lawsuits this month.\" Because\n[01:11:13] when when your when your business gets\n[01:11:15] to that scale, you're constantly dealing\n[01:11:17] with litigation from so many different\n[01:11:19] >> Wasn't he dealing with this personally\n[01:11:21] as well?\n[01:11:21] >> I don't Yeah. There was like\n[01:11:22] >> he jumped in on some email while you\n[01:11:24] were\n[01:11:24] >> Yes. Yeah. And he's he I mean, he's one\n[01:11:26] of my favorite people in the world, but\n[01:11:27] I go, \"Oh, wow.\" Like, if I want to be\n[01:11:30] envious, I've got to go to the wall. I\n[01:11:32] I've got to be Oh, I also want the 2,000\n[01:11:34] emails a month. And likewise, I mean, me\n[01:11:36] and you were on the road trip, and I\n[01:11:39] think it's probably good for the viewers\n[01:11:40] because I think a lot of people could\n[01:11:41] look at you and go, \"Good-look guy, um,\n[01:11:44] super successful, rich, knows loads of\n[01:11:46] people, and that's the kind of Call of\n[01:11:48] Duty model. Me and Chris are on a road\n[01:11:50] trip in America, and we're going to put\n[01:11:52] the tunes on and blare through the\n[01:11:55] roads.\" And then Sky, your podcast ads\n[01:11:59] manager, calls up. But I think with the\n[01:12:01] way people assume the ads work for the\n[01:12:03] show is probably, oh, Chris just gets a\n[01:12:04] load of free stuff and money, right?\n[01:12:05] That's what I think they think. Whereas\n[01:12:07] you kind of then get to sit there with\n[01:12:08] the war and it's Sky going, yeah,\n[01:12:10] they're just not happy with that\n[01:12:11] Instagram story. It's Chris going, I've\n[01:12:13] filmed that one four times now. Why are\n[01:12:14] they not happy with it? And I go, oh,\n[01:12:16] okay, my model before was the Call of\n[01:12:18] Duty and now I'm seeing the war. So\n[01:12:20] unless I've seen the war, I'm not\n[01:12:22] envious. And if I I see the war and I\n[01:12:24] like it, I'm willing to be Napoleon. M\n[01:12:27] >> I think when Mark Zuckerberg was on Joe\n[01:12:28] Rogan, he describes like his morning and\n[01:12:31] it's like he wakes up and he doesn't\n[01:12:33] look at his phone because when he looks\n[01:12:34] at his phone it's just loads of\n[01:12:36] >> Yeah.\n[01:12:38] Oh god. Like that never goes away. Like\n[01:12:39] it doesn't matter how big the business\n[01:12:40] is\n[01:12:41] >> just gets more. Well, the emails are\n[01:12:43] just worse. It's the emails that like 15\n[01:12:44] people below you didn't have the answer\n[01:12:46] to.\n[01:12:46] >> Well, that's another Sam Harrism where\n[01:12:49] there will never come a day when you\n[01:12:50] don't have any problems.\n[01:12:52] >> Or did you think that you were going to\n[01:12:53] wake up one day and there be no\n[01:12:55] problems? It's like getting to a video\n[01:12:56] game level where there's no more enemies\n[01:12:58] to fight. No, your problems will change,\n[01:13:00] but having problems will never go away.\n[01:13:02] The the line from your idea about Call\n[01:13:05] of Duty versus War is nailed by James\n[01:13:07] Clear here. How many people love the\n[01:13:09] idea of a thing but not the reality? It\n[01:13:11] doesn't make sense to continue wanting\n[01:13:13] something if you're not willing to do\n[01:13:14] what it takes to get it. If you don't\n[01:13:16] want to live the lifestyle, then release\n[01:13:18] yourself from the desire. To crave the\n[01:13:20] result, but not the process is to\n[01:13:22] guarantee disappointment.\n[01:13:23] >> Beautiful. beautiful nailed it. Um Papa\n[01:13:27] has this uh idea um he's like one of the\n[01:13:30] founding fathers of modern science that\n[01:13:32] essentially life is problem solving and\n[01:13:35] then David Deutsch builds upon his ideas\n[01:13:36] which is he has a few things but one all\n[01:13:39] problems unless they defy the laws of\n[01:13:41] physics are fundamentally solvable but\n[01:13:44] so that's the optimistic note but\n[01:13:45] there's a big caveat there which is as\n[01:13:47] soon as you solve a problem it leads to\n[01:13:49] another problem. So solutions are\n[01:13:51] infinite but problems are also infinite.\n[01:13:53] So, let's say we solved the problem of\n[01:13:55] fire. Okay, now we have the problem of\n[01:13:58] smoke. Okay, we've solved the problem of\n[01:14:00] smoke. We've got a chimney. Okay, now\n[01:14:02] we've got a dirty chimney. Okay, we're\n[01:14:04] going to we solve that problem by\n[01:14:06] getting some children in to clean it.\n[01:14:07] Oh, now we've got the problem of child\n[01:14:08] labor. And it's just D D D D D D D D D D\n[01:14:10] D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D\n[01:14:10] D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D\n[01:14:10] D D D D D D D D D D D and it's both the\n[01:14:12] beginning of infinity, both for problems\n[01:14:13] and solutions. So, life is problem\n[01:14:15] solving.\n[01:14:17] >> Very good, Johnny. Where you go? I have\n[01:14:20] another lesson which is\n[01:14:25] it's a dad based lesson about being a\n[01:14:27] dad.\n[01:14:28] >> Um, have you seen American Beauty? Seen\n[01:14:30] the film American Beauty?\n[01:14:31] >> No.\n[01:14:31] >> No.\n[01:14:32] >> Tom Cruz.\n[01:14:33] >> Uh, no.\n[01:14:34] >> Oh.\n[01:14:35] >> Um,\n[01:14:35] >> shows that I haven't seen.\n[01:14:37] >> That's my That's me verifying that I\n[01:14:39] haven't seen American Beauty.\n[01:14:40] >> Kevin Spacy. I'd recommend watching it.\n[01:14:42] It's really good. There's a there's a\n[01:14:43] scene in it where um there's a guy\n[01:14:45] watching he's just sat mesmerized\n[01:14:47] watching a bag blowing in the wind and\n[01:14:50] he ends up in tears because there's he\n[01:14:53] can't believe the amount of beauty in\n[01:14:55] the bag floating in the wind. And I've\n[01:14:57] always been really jealous of that scene\n[01:14:59] because there's a guy that's just\n[01:15:01] absolutely mesmerized with something\n[01:15:03] completely normal and ordinary and\n[01:15:05] everyone's like going around chasing\n[01:15:06] like the new thing, the novel\n[01:15:08] experience, the new like location,\n[01:15:10] possession, whatever. The thing the the\n[01:15:13] the thing that I've noticed that I\n[01:15:15] wasn't expecting about being a dad is\n[01:15:17] the is watching\n[01:15:21] watching your child see something for\n[01:15:23] the first time completely reintroduces\n[01:15:25] you to life like little things before\n[01:15:29] they just became part of the background,\n[01:15:30] part of the scenery. It's like the first\n[01:15:32] time they watch a dog bark, the first\n[01:15:34] time they see a bird flying, the first\n[01:15:36] time they hear a noise, you're just\n[01:15:38] transported for that split second into\n[01:15:40] like, \"Oh god.\" Yeah. Like that is\n[01:15:42] that's crazy that thing. And it it's a\n[01:15:46] it it's a I think like you guys probably\n[01:15:48] had this like one of the challenges of\n[01:15:50] like you get older and you feel like\n[01:15:51] time goes faster and faster and faster\n[01:15:53] and it's just the same experiences on\n[01:15:54] repeat. It's a really nice like pinpoint\n[01:15:58] back to like, oh yeah, like that cup's\n[01:16:03] colder than I was expecting it to be. Oh\n[01:16:05] yeah, the moisture feels really weird.\n[01:16:07] >> And 10 minutes goes by.\n[01:16:09] >> So that's been a really cool something I\n[01:16:11] wasn't expecting to happen,\n[01:16:12] >> but it's been a really cool experience\n[01:16:14] this year.\n[01:16:16] >> That is so lovely.\n[01:16:18] >> You're so\n[01:16:18] >> It's been great seeing that in you as\n[01:16:21] well, Johnny. Over the year, I've I've\n[01:16:23] honestly I've like seen your heart open\n[01:16:25] and like almost unlock this like aspect,\n[01:16:28] your personality that um that your\n[01:16:32] daughter's brought out in you.\n[01:16:34] >> Thanks, man. What is it that's going on\n[01:16:36] with us,\n[01:16:38] >> right? Cuz you've had a kid,\n[01:16:41] but none of us have\n[01:16:43] >> a Moleskin notepad.\n[01:16:44] >> You were on a moleskin notepad, but none\n[01:16:46] of us are. I I just get this sense. I\n[01:16:48] don't know whether anybody else that's\n[01:16:50] listening feels it, but 2025 was a very\n[01:16:52] feelely year generally. I think for a\n[01:16:55] lot of people that were around me, it\n[01:16:56] was like a big emotions\n[01:16:59] year.\n[01:16:59] >> I think our lessons and realizations\n[01:17:02] each time we do this end up being\n[01:17:03] weirdly similar.\n[01:17:06] >> There's definitely we're on a trajectory\n[01:17:09] that's sort of moving at a a similar\n[01:17:11] kind of pace. You see that um when you\n[01:17:13] have a load of um girls around one\n[01:17:15] another, their menration cycles sync up.\n[01:17:18] So it's\n[01:17:19] >> hack sync up.\n[01:17:20] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:17:21] >> Even remotely.\n[01:17:22] >> Interesting. Yeah. That's that's that's\n[01:17:24] cool, man. I mean, look, the the\n[01:17:26] opportunity to revisit something old for\n[01:17:30] the first time\n[01:17:31] >> is just super cool. And obviously\n[01:17:34] because you're marrying this with a deep\n[01:17:38] meditation practice that's consistent,\n[01:17:40] you're getting at this from multiple\n[01:17:43] angles.\n[01:17:44] >> Mhm.\n[01:17:45] >> It's funny as as you started the story\n[01:17:46] then about the film, I started staring\n[01:17:49] at the carpet and I was in this gaze for\n[01:17:52] the carpet for like 5 seconds cuz one of\n[01:17:55] my favorite stories um that I read this\n[01:17:57] year was from Morgan Hel's book. I don't\n[01:18:00] know the name of the chap, but he um\n[01:18:02] he's blind uh from basically birth to\n[01:18:06] about 45 and he has this experimental\n[01:18:08] eye surgery and he can see for the first\n[01:18:11] time and he's after the surgery just at\n[01:18:14] the opticians just staring at the carpet\n[01:18:16] for like an hour and he's just\n[01:18:18] fascinated by the details of the carpet\n[01:18:20] and I realize I walk past carpet all the\n[01:18:22] time and don't think about it. Yeah. So,\n[01:18:25] wouldn't it be crazy to be alive for a\n[01:18:28] long time, but experiencing something\n[01:18:31] for the first time?\n[01:18:32] >> Cuz you see those mirror,\n[01:18:34] >> well, you see those videos of of babies\n[01:18:38] that hear for the first time, but\n[01:18:39] they're usually three or four or\n[01:18:41] something, and you go, well, how, you\n[01:18:42] know, how much life would you have\n[01:18:44] experienced up until that point? But if\n[01:18:46] you're someone who has a sense of self\n[01:18:49] and and maybe a partner and and a\n[01:18:52] position in society and all the rest of\n[01:18:54] it and then you get reintroduced this,\n[01:18:57] you know, cosmic dose of novelty\n[01:19:00] and wonder into a system that already is\n[01:19:03] pretty well put together. The the I\n[01:19:06] think I told you about this ages ago,\n[01:19:08] the elderly clout hypothesis. We talk\n[01:19:09] about the perils of fame too young, but\n[01:19:11] never the perils of fame too old. Like\n[01:19:13] what happens if you're 60 and you become\n[01:19:15] the most famous psychologist in the\n[01:19:17] world? Say, well, you know, Jordan\n[01:19:19] Peterson had to navigate that. You get\n[01:19:21] plucked out of obscurity. You think you\n[01:19:23] know who you are. You think you know\n[01:19:24] your place in society.\n[01:19:25] >> And now that's you've been ripped from\n[01:19:28] your moorings and you got to try and\n[01:19:30] work out who the [ __ ] am I in this new\n[01:19:32] world.\n[01:19:32] >> Yeah. And that like\n[01:19:33] >> I think we all we've all experienced\n[01:19:35] that when we downloaded Alfred for the\n[01:19:37] first time.\n[01:19:40] like everything we knew about the way we\n[01:19:43] interface with technology suddenly just\n[01:19:45] like oh god I've been driving with the\n[01:19:47] brakes on. I've been seeing in black and\n[01:19:49] white all my life.\n[01:19:52] I I there's there is a bit of me that\n[01:19:54] thinks because the growth of the show is\n[01:19:57] so like [ __ ] exponential,\n[01:20:01] so many amazing lowhanging fruit\n[01:20:05] insights to me feel cheap to do because\n[01:20:09] they've been done maybe multiple times\n[01:20:11] before, but because of the exposure that\n[01:20:15] people have had to it even within the\n[01:20:17] same stream of content which is Modern\n[01:20:19] Wisdom and me, We probably do need to go\n[01:20:22] back.\n[01:20:23] >> I think this should this should be like\n[01:20:24] a required reading like new the show.\n[01:20:26] >> Yeah, you got to go through the OG's,\n[01:20:28] right? Because otherwise we're gonna\n[01:20:29] break the Alfred service.\n[01:20:30] >> Headspace calm and then arrived at\n[01:20:32] waking up trackpad speed.\n[01:20:34] >> ROMwad. You need to sleep with your\n[01:20:36] phone outside of your bedroom. Right.\n[01:20:37] You can't just This is one of the\n[01:20:38] problems. Some of the hacks that we\n[01:20:40] believed in the companies are defunct\n[01:20:42] now. I'm pretty sure you can't get like\n[01:20:44] the sponsors. The protein works I think\n[01:20:46] actually went into administration and\n[01:20:48] there's there is us. They're in the show\n[01:20:50] notes at some point.\n[01:20:52] >> Well, it was Romad then. You were on\n[01:20:53] Romad.\n[01:20:54] >> I was a Romad model.\n[01:20:55] >> Yeah.\n[01:20:55] >> Do you do you stretching now?\n[01:20:58] >> I did none.\n[01:20:59] >> I don't do much stretching now. George\n[01:21:01] does loads.\n[01:21:02] >> Do you a little bit?\n[01:21:04] >> Stretching all the time. Yousef, what\n[01:21:05] you got?\n[01:21:08] >> We'll get back to talking in just one\n[01:21:09] second, but first, if you have been\n[01:21:10] feeling a bit sluggish, your\n[01:21:11] testosterone levels might be the\n[01:21:13] problem. They play a huge role in your\n[01:21:15] energy, focus, and performance. But most\n[01:21:17] people have no idea what theirs are or\n[01:21:19] what to do if something's off. Which is\n[01:21:21] why I partnered with Function because I\n[01:21:22] wanted a smarter and more comprehensive\n[01:21:24] way to actually understand what's\n[01:21:26] happening inside of my body. Twice a\n[01:21:28] year, they run lab tests that monitor\n[01:21:30] over a 100 biomarkers. They've got a\n[01:21:31] team of expert physicians that analyze\n[01:21:33] the data and give you actionable advice\n[01:21:35] to improve your health and lifespan.\n[01:21:38] Seeing your testosterone levels and\n[01:21:39] dozens of other biomarkers charted\n[01:21:41] across the course of a year with\n[01:21:42] actionable insights to genuinely improve\n[01:21:44] them gives you a clear path to making\n[01:21:46] your life better. Getting your blood\n[01:21:48] work drawn and analyzed like this would\n[01:21:49] usually cost thousands and be a\n[01:21:51] nightmare. But with function, it's just\n[01:21:53] $499 bucks. And now you can get an\n[01:21:54] additional $100 off, bringing it down to\n[01:21:57] $399.\n[01:21:59] Get the exact same blood panels that I\n[01:22:00] get and save a h 100red bucks by going\n[01:22:02] to the link in the description below or\n[01:22:03] heading to\n[01:22:04] functionhealth.com/modernwisdom.\n[01:22:07] That's at functionhealth.com/modmist.\n[01:22:11] >> Similar to Johnny as well, I periods\n[01:22:13] have synced up. I have taken a bit of a\n[01:22:17] journey from head to heart over the the\n[01:22:20] year too. Um, and like massive amounts\n[01:22:23] of of of gratitude for being able to\n[01:22:26] like spend your guys' birthdays\n[01:22:28] together, like to to travel with you all\n[01:22:31] and like um all of all of that stuff.\n[01:22:35] really just really seeing an\n[01:22:36] appreciation for it. Like almost like\n[01:22:39] Johnny was saying about his daughter\n[01:22:40] where if you were transported I think\n[01:22:42] Horosi talks about this where it's like\n[01:22:44] if you're transported from you know your\n[01:22:46] ' 90s into today and you're like oh I've\n[01:22:48] suddenly got another\n[01:22:50] I'm suddenly 30 again. I've got another\n[01:22:53] years to live. It's like you see it with\n[01:22:55] a whole new new level of gratitude. But\n[01:22:58] my big one is me becoming post-truth.\n[01:23:03] So,\n[01:23:04] >> this is the beginning of a hard\n[01:23:06] right-wing pivot from Yousef here, isn't\n[01:23:08] it?\n[01:23:08] >> Here we go.\n[01:23:10] >> Um, the mirror only smiles when you\n[01:23:13] smile\n[01:23:14] has been my mantra for the year.\n[01:23:18] And it's just as concrete as it sounds.\n[01:23:21] Like, you're sat staring in the mirror\n[01:23:23] miserable and going, \"Oh, I don't like\n[01:23:25] what's in the reflection. I need to try\n[01:23:27] and change that thing in the\n[01:23:28] reflection.\" And the mirror represents\n[01:23:30] the world around you. Whereas actually\n[01:23:33] like you can never change the\n[01:23:34] reflection. All you can do is bring the\n[01:23:36] positive energy to it and then\n[01:23:38] everything else reflects it back to you.\n[01:23:40] So it's just moving from\n[01:23:43] >> left brain overly empirical have to get\n[01:23:46] to some objective truth out there in\n[01:23:48] order to give myself the permission to\n[01:23:51] >> say that this is true or adopt a belief\n[01:23:53] or adopt whatever. You know actually no\n[01:23:55] like you you can you choose your beliefs\n[01:23:57] like we choose them anyway. So, it's not\n[01:23:59] as if like you're suddenly becoming woo\n[01:24:01] woo by doing that. Um, it's just being\n[01:24:03] conscious about it and then bringing\n[01:24:05] what whatever energy you want to see\n[01:24:07] reflected back into the world. And um,\n[01:24:10] in doing that, it's just been it's like\n[01:24:12] opening up a different gear in my mind.\n[01:24:15] So, um, that's been a big shift in just\n[01:24:19] how I'm choosing to see reality.\n[01:24:22] >> Very feelsy. We're all very feelsy,\n[01:24:24] which I love. I I think I I do you know\n[01:24:27] what it makes me think? It makes me\n[01:24:29] think that the\n[01:24:31] intuition that I had for most of the\n[01:24:33] last 12 months was right. It's a this is\n[01:24:36] a big um uh like my\n[01:24:42] biases are being confirmed\n[01:24:45] and uh it's not just you.\n[01:24:47] >> Yeah, it's not. It's not. And you know,\n[01:24:49] I think certainly at least from the\n[01:24:52] show's perspective, a lot of what I've\n[01:24:54] talked about over the last 12 months has\n[01:24:55] been less hardcore hustle and grind\n[01:24:58] gogggins mentality thing. I contributed\n[01:25:01] to that. You know, the the the industry\n[01:25:03] of [ __ ] your feelings, bro, just work\n[01:25:05] harder. I had, you know, I served my\n[01:25:07] time contributing to that. But even\n[01:25:10] [ __ ] Horoszi started to make the\n[01:25:12] pivot this year where he's thinking,\n[01:25:15] well, maybe I should pay a little bit of\n[01:25:16] attention to what's happening below the\n[01:25:18] neck. Maybe I maybe I should care a\n[01:25:20] little bit more. And uh yeah, this you\n[01:25:23] could say like a good summary is that\n[01:25:26] it's all vibes ultimately that what\n[01:25:28] you're trying to do is construct some\n[01:25:30] external situation or life or level of\n[01:25:34] success or belief system or whatever\n[01:25:37] externally to make yourself feel\n[01:25:40] something internally. But there is a\n[01:25:42] more direct route there. M well the\n[01:25:45] post-truth idea Yousef has um probably\n[01:25:48] stems from I don't know Yousef but the\n[01:25:50] Derek Civers has this book called useful\n[01:25:53] uh but not true um and he has this\n[01:25:56] >> uh I haven't read it but you can read it\n[01:25:58] you can read it in a couple of hours. So\n[01:26:00] there's um yeah, Civers has this useful\n[01:26:02] but not true um and he starts off with\n[01:26:04] this story of um obviously for people\n[01:26:07] who don't know he ends up being a quite\n[01:26:09] a successful entrepreneur, internet\n[01:26:11] programmer, etc., etc. But what a lot of\n[01:26:13] people don't know is when he was 17, he\n[01:26:15] crashed into um a lady that was driving\n[01:26:19] and broke her spine and she was\n[01:26:21] paralyzed for the rest of uh her life.\n[01:26:24] And he carries this from like 17 to 34,\n[01:26:26] just like ruminating on it day after day\n[01:26:28] after day, like what he did and like how\n[01:26:30] all his success is meaningless because\n[01:26:32] he's such an awful person. And one day\n[01:26:34] he goes, \"Well, I I'm going to take some\n[01:26:36] agency over it. I'm actually going to go\n[01:26:37] and see her and apologize.\" So he turns\n[01:26:40] up at a door. She answers the door and\n[01:26:43] he immediately starts sobbing like in\n[01:26:45] tears and goes, \"It's me, Derek. I'm so\n[01:26:47] sorry. I crashed into your car. I\n[01:26:48] paralyzed you.\" And she's like, \"Hold\n[01:26:49] on, hold on.\" She goes, \"Come on, walk\n[01:26:51] on in.\" And she's walking. So they both\n[01:26:53] like sit down and he's kind of discovers\n[01:26:56] that he didn't paralyze her. Like she\n[01:26:59] like broke a bit of a vertebrae, but\n[01:27:00] she's been fine ever since. And what's\n[01:27:02] interesting is she's been blaming\n[01:27:04] herself for the accident ever since. So\n[01:27:07] they both end up crying realizing that\n[01:27:08] they both had these kind of false\n[01:27:10] memories uh in their head the entire\n[01:27:12] time.\n[01:27:14] >> Yeah. It's scary to work out that your\n[01:27:17] worldview is incorrect.\n[01:27:18] >> Mhm.\n[01:27:19] >> Which it is.\n[01:27:20] >> Yeah.\n[01:27:20] >> Yeah.\n[01:27:20] >> And it's emoji. In how many other places\n[01:27:24] do you think that you've hit a woman?\n[01:27:28] How many how many assumptions do you\n[01:27:29] have about yourself or about the world\n[01:27:30] or about the past that weren't that\n[01:27:33] aren't that way?\n[01:27:35] >> Oh well, and this is I think one of the\n[01:27:37] problems that you have with going too\n[01:27:40] deep into the therapy speak world\n[01:27:43] without having action. And I'm sure if I\n[01:27:45] was to make this would be cool. If I was\n[01:27:47] to make a prediction for next year, I\n[01:27:49] get the sense that we will, or at least\n[01:27:53] for me, I predict that I'm probably\n[01:27:56] going to\n[01:27:57] keep moving through the emotions thing,\n[01:27:59] but realize it's made me less effective\n[01:28:02] and actually try and come back out the\n[01:28:04] other side into more actionoriented\n[01:28:06] stuff, but doing it from a more embodied\n[01:28:09] place. like, okay, I I've looked into\n[01:28:12] the abyss and I've stared at the shadow\n[01:28:14] a little bit and now I'm going to try\n[01:28:16] and rearn the [ __ ] your feelings, bro,\n[01:28:19] just work anyway, but while actually\n[01:28:22] feeling them. And uh\n[01:28:24] >> well, that's what you were saying while\n[01:28:25] back, Chris, where like it's not that\n[01:28:26] we're throwing out the idea of being\n[01:28:28] able to do hard work, it's just not\n[01:28:31] conflating the actual pain of the work\n[01:28:33] with the progress.\n[01:28:36] >> Yeah. Do do you think that you know the\n[01:28:38] thing I think we probably all had this\n[01:28:39] before you like meditate or do any kind\n[01:28:41] of self-improvement stuff is that will\n[01:28:42] will this sap my desire to\n[01:28:46] >> work harder or do you feel like that's\n[01:28:48] happened?\n[01:28:49] >> You can get there. I I think I can get\n[01:28:51] there. Yeah. Because I can\n[01:28:56] not in terms of not wanting the goals\n[01:28:58] anymore. And perhaps part of this is\n[01:29:00] simply just achieving a lot of the\n[01:29:01] goals, but at least a good bit of it for\n[01:29:05] me comes out of well,\n[01:29:10] how much of what I was doing was to hide\n[01:29:12] from emotional states that I didn't want\n[01:29:14] to feel like I feel lonely so I'll work\n[01:29:16] hard or I feel um frustrated so I'll\n[01:29:20] work hard or I feel in insufficient or\n[01:29:22] inferior so I'll work hard. And in that\n[01:29:25] you hide, you artificially bolster your\n[01:29:30] sense of selfworth because you don't\n[01:29:33] feel like without that you're enough. So\n[01:29:35] you're chasing enoughness and you're\n[01:29:37] injecting work rate into it and it's\n[01:29:40] doing two things. It's pushing you\n[01:29:42] towards something which makes you think,\n[01:29:43] wow, I'm moving in the right direction.\n[01:29:45] It doesn't matter if I don't love myself\n[01:29:46] today because tomorrow I'll be better.\n[01:29:49] And you have this sort of permanent mana\n[01:29:51] mñana maning of that. But the other\n[01:29:53] thing is by being so busy it drowns out\n[01:29:56] the fleeting thoughts that make you\n[01:29:57] doubt stuff in any case. So a busy\n[01:30:00] calendar is a hedge against existential\n[01:30:01] loneliness. And if you just stack your\n[01:30:03] day back to back I'm moving in the right\n[01:30:05] direction. So the long-term like I'm\n[01:30:07] doing the thing thing gets sorted. Plus\n[01:30:09] the immediate I've in insulated myself\n[01:30:12] from being able to hear the thing thing\n[01:30:14] is also happening. So I think it can,\n[01:30:17] but ultimately if the reason that you\n[01:30:20] work so hard is so that you can finally\n[01:30:21] feel good about yourself or be happy or\n[01:30:23] have good vibes and if in the process of\n[01:30:26] doing that you destroy the vibes and you\n[01:30:27] don't make yourself feel good about\n[01:30:28] yourself. If you can just access the\n[01:30:31] vibes directly, it doesn't matter. Like\n[01:30:35] you have actually managed to find a\n[01:30:36] shortcut through the mountain by\n[01:30:38] tunneling straight through the middle of\n[01:30:39] it. And um it's still wet clay for me.\n[01:30:42] like all of this stuff is still really\n[01:30:44] really really [ __ ] wet clay. But uh I\n[01:30:47] think it's the I think it's the right\n[01:30:48] way to go and I think that a lot of\n[01:30:50] people\n[01:30:52] realize this as well. And it's there is\n[01:30:54] kind of two worlds. There's the the\n[01:30:55] people who are still like looking at the\n[01:30:57] top of the mountain and then some people\n[01:30:59] who have done a little bit of stuff\n[01:31:00] maybe got to some kind of an altitude.\n[01:31:02] They're like don't think that I need to\n[01:31:05] go any higher. I think I actually need\n[01:31:06] to go down and reassess my route. And\n[01:31:08] the people who are still on the climb\n[01:31:10] just do not understand the perspective\n[01:31:12] that the people who have gone a little\n[01:31:13] bit higher up got. And and that's fine\n[01:31:16] because eventually they'll get there and\n[01:31:17] it's the unteachable lesson and so on\n[01:31:18] and so forth. But it does lead to um it\n[01:31:22] sounds much more\n[01:31:25] like uh upper aaming and and and\n[01:31:29] supportive and noble to be on the climb.\n[01:31:32] And it sounds like privileged bourgeoa\n[01:31:36] to say, you know, man, I'm just like\n[01:31:38] working on my vibes, dude.\n[01:31:40] >> But I I get the sense that anyone who's\n[01:31:43] sufficiently mindful is going to end up\n[01:31:45] there in any case. So I think this is a\n[01:31:47] path that everybody's on just a\n[01:31:48] different stages. analogy I've heard\n[01:31:50] >> the best analogy I've heard for this is\n[01:31:52] that it's not about the whether work,\n[01:31:57] hard work, laziness, whatever. There's\n[01:32:00] any there's no moralizing of the thing\n[01:32:01] itself. It's about if you're using\n[01:32:04] feelings of insufficiency to drive your\n[01:32:07] work, then it's like you're using dirty\n[01:32:09] fuel which will eventually destroy the\n[01:32:11] engine. So it's not hard work is bad.\n[01:32:14] It's if the dirty fuel is the thing\n[01:32:18] which is driving you to do it, then\n[01:32:20] >> that's going to collapse.\n[01:32:21] >> Why you working hard? Yeah.\n[01:32:23] >> I I had like the It's weird that you\n[01:32:25] said that cuz I had like I've been\n[01:32:26] thinking about this a lot of like the\n[01:32:29] feeling that you have achieved a thing\n[01:32:31] you've been chasing a long time and the\n[01:32:32] like the the drive you kind of feel the\n[01:32:34] drive going away a bit. the\n[01:32:38] what I what I think the next step is is\n[01:32:42] like you've just completed Call of Duty\n[01:32:44] on hard and now you need to start again\n[01:32:46] at level one but on veteran\n[01:32:49] >> and you kind of know like oh it's this\n[01:32:50] level that guy's there and that guy\n[01:32:51] comes out that door and shoot him so\n[01:32:53] you're kind of going through that you\n[01:32:54] pick a different thing to chase\n[01:32:57] >> that's go on Josh this sounds very\n[01:33:00] technical but she shouldn't be but do\n[01:33:02] you think it's playing Call of Duty\n[01:33:04] again at a hard level or do you think\n[01:33:05] it's playing a new game.\n[01:33:07] >> I think it has to be the same game\n[01:33:09] because that's then you're like\n[01:33:10] navigating the new goal but kind of\n[01:33:13] knowing like, oh, this happens\n[01:33:15] >> because I think the problem with like\n[01:33:16] the first goal with the I want to bend\n[01:33:19] 100 kilos is you that is the beginning\n[01:33:21] of the journey of this is it. It's the\n[01:33:24] tub of way. I just need this tub of\n[01:33:25] weight. I just need 100,000 subscribers.\n[01:33:28] But when you pick like if Chris picked\n[01:33:30] 10 million subscribers, all right, well\n[01:33:31] yeah, here we go again.\n[01:33:32] >> But do you think\n[01:33:33] >> same journey? So to use the 100 kilos\n[01:33:35] one, do you think it's okay now I've got\n[01:33:36] to do 110 120 or do you think it's oh\n[01:33:39] now I want to get my resting heart rate\n[01:33:41] down to this or I want to get\n[01:33:44] >> Pilates or whatever it is\n[01:33:45] >> it's so I think like that's the\n[01:33:47] obviously it can't be the same goal so\n[01:33:49] the Call of Duty is just an analogy.\n[01:33:50] >> Mhm.\n[01:33:52] >> Do you see what I mean?\n[01:33:54] >> Yeah. So the reason it's like it's it's\n[01:33:56] picking a new goal that that challenges\n[01:33:58] you in a different way, but you know\n[01:34:00] that like this is just the this that's\n[01:34:02] how you get the feel that's how you get\n[01:34:04] the drive back.\n[01:34:04] >> So it doesn't matter if it's the same\n[01:34:06] thing or a new goal, it's just a bigger\n[01:34:08] thing than previous essentially.\n[01:34:09] >> Yeah. But it's the um\n[01:34:12] it's like cuz I think when you have\n[01:34:14] those feelings of like ah you know I've\n[01:34:16] just kind of I've reached this goal and\n[01:34:18] it was just fulfilling this thing and I\n[01:34:19] think that just means like you've\n[01:34:21] arrived at the tail end of that like\n[01:34:23] you've that particular arc\n[01:34:24] >> that's the final level. Well, you think\n[01:34:26] you think in ox a lot. I remember one of\n[01:34:27] the insights from relationships 101 that\n[01:34:29] you had, which I think is still true, is\n[01:34:33] a lot of people restart the same cycle\n[01:34:35] with a new person, assuming that they're\n[01:34:37] going to get some more longevity out of\n[01:34:38] it. Whereas it's not\n[01:34:40] >> this relationship will be different.\n[01:34:41] >> Yeah. No, it's it's it's largely the\n[01:34:43] same arc from excitement to familiarity.\n[01:34:47] And people think that the familiarity is\n[01:34:50] an indication that they should switch to\n[01:34:52] get someone who the excitement lasts\n[01:34:54] with for longer.\n[01:34:55] >> Yeah. But it's not. That arc is pretty\n[01:34:56] locked in. And I I think that you're\n[01:34:58] true. And this is certainly true for me\n[01:34:59] with the live stuff. You know, it's\n[01:35:01] sufficiently similar to what I do, but\n[01:35:04] sufficiently different that it's a new\n[01:35:06] territory, a new video game to try and\n[01:35:09] conquer.\n[01:35:09] >> Mhm.\n[01:35:10] >> And it feeds into the main\n[01:35:12] >> kind of starting from zero.\n[01:35:13] >> But I'm starting from zero. Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:35:14] Yeah. So I mean I guess\n[01:35:18] the tighter and tighter spirals thing\n[01:35:20] you have said before is so true as well\n[01:35:22] because in the micro or if this is done\n[01:35:25] too frequently what this looks like is a\n[01:35:27] non-essentialist\n[01:35:29] worldview. It looks like you're trying\n[01:35:30] to do lots of things at once which means\n[01:35:32] that you're not good at anything. You\n[01:35:34] can be anything you want but not\n[01:35:35] everything. But you can be lots of\n[01:35:37] things as long as you periodize when\n[01:35:39] you're focusing on them. M\n[01:35:40] >> I couldn't have done live tour, writing,\n[01:35:43] podcast, all the rest of the move to I\n[01:35:45] couldn't have done that all at once. But\n[01:35:47] if I chunk them into sufficiently\n[01:35:49] dedicated, sufficiently long durations,\n[01:35:52] we'll probably get away with it. Uh all\n[01:35:54] right, we'll do we'll do one more one\n[01:35:56] more little round. Um and if there's any\n[01:35:59] absolute slammers, just do a couple. Um\n[01:36:03] this is a new one from me which I\n[01:36:05] haven't written about yet. Uh just\n[01:36:07] because you can lift it doesn't mean you\n[01:36:08] should. And this is\n[01:36:12] the inverse of the region beta paradox.\n[01:36:14] So um most people if things get\n[01:36:18] sufficiently bad it galvanizes them to\n[01:36:20] get out of a situation something that's\n[01:36:23] challenging or painful or difficult. But\n[01:36:25] if you have an unusually high tolerance\n[01:36:28] for discomfort and are pretty resilient\n[01:36:31] then you become like the David Gogggins\n[01:36:33] of suffering like [ __ ] the boats I'll\n[01:36:36] carry the whole fleet. And what happens\n[01:36:38] is you are able to put yourself into a\n[01:36:41] situation where you can sustain\n[01:36:42] discomfort or a wrong path or a\n[01:36:47] challenging position or a job that you\n[01:36:48] shouldn't stay in or a lifestyle that\n[01:36:50] you need to or whatever. You can\n[01:36:52] continue to push yourself through that\n[01:36:54] because your capacity to hold on and to\n[01:36:56] just keep going is so strong\n[01:37:00] that you go way you find that the\n[01:37:04] basement's got a [ __ ] cellar with a\n[01:37:05] trap door in it below the bottom of the\n[01:37:08] line that most people's region beta\n[01:37:10] would have kicked them out the bottom\n[01:37:11] of. It's like, oh, this was already bad\n[01:37:13] enough and most people would have been\n[01:37:14] galvanized into action. But for some\n[01:37:16] reason, your capacity to like just keep\n[01:37:18] going is so great that you do and you do\n[01:37:21] and you do and you do and you do. And um\n[01:37:24] it's strange because the things that you\n[01:37:26] get praised for in public are often very\n[01:37:29] damaging in private. Uh the the the\n[01:37:31] resilience that you need to get yourself\n[01:37:32] through work is not the sort of thing\n[01:37:34] that you're supposed to have in your\n[01:37:34] friendships. For instance, you know, if\n[01:37:36] a friend continues to misuse you or take\n[01:37:40] advantage of you or isn't there or is\n[01:37:42] just bad bad influence or whatever it\n[01:37:44] is, like if that's in work and you're\n[01:37:46] trying to get this particular piece of\n[01:37:48] coding or website to work and and and\n[01:37:50] fit together, [ __ ] the Zappier\n[01:37:51] integration. Won't do this thing. I'm\n[01:37:54] trying to get this client. I'm going to\n[01:37:55] fly across the world and do all the rest\n[01:37:56] of it. That's fine. But if it's you\n[01:37:58] trying to regularly chase down a friend\n[01:38:00] that's self-destructing,\n[01:38:02] there is a limit. there's supposed to be\n[01:38:03] a limit to that. And um yeah, the the\n[01:38:06] realization just because something's\n[01:38:08] heavy doesn't mean you should lift it.\n[01:38:09] And the reverse of that is just because\n[01:38:11] somebody carries a weight well doesn't\n[01:38:12] mean it isn't heavy. So from the outside\n[01:38:15] um a lot of the time people that listen\n[01:38:17] to shows like this one and and and read\n[01:38:19] your guys' stuff and George's stuff, um\n[01:38:22] they're usually the most put together\n[01:38:24] person in the room. Typically, they're\n[01:38:26] the one that their friends turn to for\n[01:38:28] advice because you listen to you you\n[01:38:30] read that psychology stuff, don't you?\n[01:38:31] what should I what should I do about my\n[01:38:33] relationship with my mother or whatever\n[01:38:34] it might be. And what that causes is for\n[01:38:36] a lot of people to never ask the\n[01:38:38] question of the person who usually\n[01:38:39] answers\n[01:38:41] and go, \"Hey, how you doing? Can we\n[01:38:44] check in?\" Oh, yeah. It's like, \"No, no,\n[01:38:45] no.\" Like, I really mean, \"How are you?\"\n[01:38:47] Like, \"What's what's Let's turn this\n[01:38:50] around.\" And uh it takes a it takes a\n[01:38:54] real\n[01:38:56] brave friend. It takes a real sort of\n[01:38:58] impactful friend to push through the\n[01:39:01] competence defense mechanism that\n[01:39:02] everybody has up. And um yeah, in some\n[01:39:05] ways that's another curse of competence\n[01:39:06] that people don't see you as someone\n[01:39:08] that needs\n[01:39:10] uh reassurance or steps in to check on\n[01:39:13] you. And uh I think\n[01:39:16] yeah,\n[01:39:18] beware of using what you're praised for\n[01:39:21] in public, your resilience in your\n[01:39:23] private life. And just because someone\n[01:39:25] carries the weight well doesn't mean it\n[01:39:26] isn't heavy. I think\n[01:39:27] >> that's a great It's RP.\n[01:39:30] >> It's RP for personal life. Yeah. Yeah,\n[01:39:32] >> it is. I think the I think this is kind\n[01:39:34] of the same thing you're talking about,\n[01:39:35] but like if you're a person um that is\n[01:39:38] like in charge, responsible for things,\n[01:39:42] you're the you're by default the person\n[01:39:44] that people come to for like advice or\n[01:39:46] what do I do? How how does this work? I\n[01:39:49] think that straight away makes it harder\n[01:39:50] to be like, I'm struggling\n[01:39:53] >> because the that you I think the feeling\n[01:39:55] that that creates like if I admit I'm\n[01:39:57] struggling, they then have no one to ask\n[01:40:00] like what do I\n[01:40:01] >> I'm the guy. I'm supposed to be the guy.\n[01:40:02] You're the girl.\n[01:40:03] >> So, I think that that it I've definitely\n[01:40:04] felt that feeling of like when you're\n[01:40:06] supposed to be kind of holding all the\n[01:40:08] everything together, you sort of have to\n[01:40:11] maintain that\n[01:40:13] like facade to a degree. Even if you\n[01:40:14] like, I don't know what to do. If you\n[01:40:16] say that, suddenly the whole the whole\n[01:40:18] thing falls.\n[01:40:19] >> That's an interesting one. I remember\n[01:40:20] reading um Endurance by Alfred Lansing\n[01:40:23] and he's talking about Shackleton's\n[01:40:24] diary entries versus what everybody\n[01:40:25] else's diary entries are,\n[01:40:27] >> right? And Shackleton's diary entries\n[01:40:29] are just racked with self-doubt and\n[01:40:30] uncertainty and he the whole experience\n[01:40:33] is him just swimming in melancholy and\n[01:40:35] fear. But the soon as he puts the diary\n[01:40:38] down, he steps outside and he just, you\n[01:40:41] know, galvanizes this entire group. So I\n[01:40:43] do think that in a professional context\n[01:40:45] and if you are a leader, this is a price\n[01:40:47] leaders pay that nobody else gets to\n[01:40:48] see. But this is the reason that you're\n[01:40:50] supposed to have a [ __ ] supportive\n[01:40:51] spouse or good friends who don't work\n[01:40:54] for you or a therapist that you can talk\n[01:40:56] to or whatever whatever your, you know,\n[01:40:58] outlet of choice is, but somebody who's\n[01:41:00] there and with whom you can go,\n[01:41:04] I I don't [ __ ] know what I'm doing. I\n[01:41:07] don't know how to get out of this.\n[01:41:08] >> And I I think that's yeah, the value of\n[01:41:11] multifaceted social group. Napoleon has\n[01:41:15] this line that a leader is a dealer of\n[01:41:18] hope. could be Churchillian drift, but\n[01:41:20] I'm pretty sure it's Napoleon.\n[01:41:22] >> And my literally takes me on to mine,\n[01:41:25] which is perfect. Um, so to do a very\n[01:41:29] much like a Christopher Nolan reveal\n[01:41:31] now, I'm going to criticize my f\n[01:41:33] previous one. So then you come in here.\n[01:41:35] It's been a setup all along. So the\n[01:41:38] reveal is I think right now in 2025 2026\n[01:41:43] that deep work um which is kind of\n[01:41:46] sitting there focused without any\n[01:41:47] distractions is extremely useful but\n[01:41:50] it's currently overpriced relative to\n[01:41:53] the amount of people that probably\n[01:41:54] listen to your show and do that. And\n[01:41:56] what I call deep sparring is\n[01:41:59] significantly underpriced, which is kind\n[01:42:02] of what you discussed then, right? That\n[01:42:03] you can't say to people, oh, I'm\n[01:42:05] struggling with this, particularly\n[01:42:06] people that are relying on you. But like\n[01:42:08] I've realized now it there's probably\n[01:42:10] about three to five people in my life um\n[01:42:14] where we can sit down, go for dinner. Um\n[01:42:17] I did this on Friday with my uh friend\n[01:42:20] Harry in London. We went for dinner,\n[01:42:21] spoke everything through, had our\n[01:42:23] laptops there and he was going through\n[01:42:25] issues. he's facing I was going through\n[01:42:27] issues um he was facing and vice versa\n[01:42:30] and there's this uh nicamatra line of um\n[01:42:34] when I advise other people I gain 20 IQ\n[01:42:37] points and when I advise myself I lose\n[01:42:39] 20 IQ points. So you essentially gain 40\n[01:42:42] IQ points because they get to come in\n[01:42:43] and look at all your problems and\n[01:42:44] they're a super smart person and then\n[01:42:46] you get to go in and look at their\n[01:42:47] problems and then the next time you come\n[01:42:49] back because you've been together you're\n[01:42:51] kind of endlessly smarter. It's like\n[01:42:52] what we spoke about at the start of the\n[01:42:55] um just before we recorded which was the\n[01:42:57] film Oppenheimer. You needed that deep\n[01:42:59] sparring time in person. If if Fman was\n[01:43:02] in South America and Fermy was over\n[01:43:05] there like it wouldn't happen. So\n[01:43:07] there's something that Yeah. that. And\n[01:43:08] what's beautiful about the deep sparring\n[01:43:09] idea is you probably need like 3 to four\n[01:43:11] hours a quarter and then you stack up\n[01:43:14] all that deep work on top of it versus\n[01:43:16] you sitting in your own little cage\n[01:43:17] ruminating, coming up with the most\n[01:43:20] absurd conspiracies about yourself and\n[01:43:22] then working on top of that. Um, I think\n[01:43:24] it's a huge negative. Do you think the\n[01:43:26] other people in this in the deep\n[01:43:27] sparring need no should they have no\n[01:43:30] context? They have to be kind of\n[01:43:32] completely separate. Um, I no, I think\n[01:43:34] you probably want somebody who you don't\n[01:43:36] directly work with, but you want\n[01:43:38] somebody who you really really respect.\n[01:43:41] Um, like a a good rule of thumb I've\n[01:43:43] I've I've tried to take this year, which\n[01:43:44] is ignore like all criticism from\n[01:43:47] critics and like listen 100% to all\n[01:43:49] criticism from creative people or people\n[01:43:52] that are doing things. Um, so I think in\n[01:43:54] that regard then I mean you probably\n[01:43:55] could think of four or five people that\n[01:43:57] you could sit down with and and the\n[01:43:59] thing is it's kind of they call it a\n[01:44:00] live straddling poker which is um when\n[01:44:03] you go in other people start going in\n[01:44:05] and I think there's some truth to that\n[01:44:06] as well where if you go in and say hey\n[01:44:07] I'm struggling with this what do you\n[01:44:09] think if you was to take over my life\n[01:44:10] with a VR headset on what would you do\n[01:44:13] they come up with gems and then they\n[01:44:14] immediately go well I've got this thing\n[01:44:15] and it's beautiful\n[01:44:17] >> it's licensed to go there\n[01:44:20] >> I think especially for guys\n[01:44:22] And this is one of the problems upon\n[01:44:24] reflection with a lot of what's\n[01:44:25] happening in the UK I think because you\n[01:44:27] kind of have a multiplier effect of\n[01:44:31] already a British allergy to earnestness\n[01:44:35] and sincerity uh plus the male allergy\n[01:44:39] to earnestness and sincerity and they\n[01:44:41] kind of stack on top of each other. But\n[01:44:43] if you can find somebody who is prepared\n[01:44:46] to go there and you open the door that\n[01:44:49] typically is reciprocated. The problem\n[01:44:51] is when you do it with the wrong person\n[01:44:55] >> and they go, \"What the [ __ ] do you mean,\n[01:44:58] mate? I don't get what you're talking\n[01:45:00] about.\"\n[01:45:01] >> 100%. I was laughing cuz uh Harry is the\n[01:45:04] absolute master of that. He's the\n[01:45:06] antidote cuz he will just drop in an\n[01:45:11] absolutely wild take on something\n[01:45:13] >> and just be like,\n[01:45:15] >> \"Prove me wrong.\"\n[01:45:16] >> And I don't think I can even repeat any\n[01:45:18] of those takes, but yeah, it's the\n[01:45:20] perfect thing. you you have to have a\n[01:45:22] sparring partner or friends that you can\n[01:45:24] drop absolutely anything with, put it on\n[01:45:27] the table in front of you and everyone\n[01:45:28] just goes, \"All right, let's let's\n[01:45:30] dissect this.\"\n[01:45:31] >> What's interesting as well is if you\n[01:45:33] study history, this is so common. So you\n[01:45:34] had the uh lunar society in the UK\n[01:45:37] during the industrial revolution where\n[01:45:39] all these um like pioneers so Arasmus\n[01:45:42] Darwin who was uh Charles Darwin's uh\n[01:45:44] grandfather, James Watt and about 10\n[01:45:46] other leaders of the industrial\n[01:45:47] revolution or poetry at the time would\n[01:45:49] meet during a full moon because this is\n[01:45:51] obviously pre-elect electricity James\n[01:45:52] Watt still working on what he's working\n[01:45:53] on. They know during a full moon they'd\n[01:45:55] meet in somebody's garden and they would\n[01:45:56] all discuss. So the the whole foundation\n[01:45:58] of the western world was built on that.\n[01:45:59] You then have Benjamin Franklin um in\n[01:46:01] the US where he he'd have these like\n[01:46:03] Junto societies that he would host and\n[01:46:05] he would mingle. I was literally reading\n[01:46:06] the other day uh the book about the\n[01:46:08] start of Uber. So Uber starts cuz one\n[01:46:11] guy is frustrated that he can't get a\n[01:46:12] taxi. So he's doing what I occasionally\n[01:46:14] do while order from multiple taxi\n[01:46:16] companies at once and the taxi arrives.\n[01:46:17] So he's then banned from all taxi apps.\n[01:46:19] And one day he's watching um Casino\n[01:46:21] Royale and he sees James Bond with his\n[01:46:23] GPS technology and he goes, \"Hold on,\n[01:46:25] that's an idea.\" And Travis, who's the\n[01:46:27] the other founder of Uber, he hosts\n[01:46:29] these jam parties at his house since he\n[01:46:31] sold his company. So he can just mingle\n[01:46:33] and meet people and they're playing\n[01:46:34] table tennis and that's where the idea\n[01:46:36] of Uber comes from. So this idea of kind\n[01:46:38] of sitting by yourself I think is just a\n[01:46:41] fallacy that is a very a modern thing\n[01:46:43] that deep sparring is so um significant\n[01:46:46] throughout history. The lone\n[01:46:48] genius theory for sort of how history\n[01:46:51] gets moved forward is so [ __ ] It's\n[01:46:54] so [ __ ] [ __ ] dude. And I guess\n[01:46:56] that would be another another lesson\n[01:46:58] from this year. I put it in one of the\n[01:46:59] vlogs that came out recently, which was\n[01:47:01] you can go pretty [ __ ] fast and quite\n[01:47:04] far on your own. And even if it's not as\n[01:47:07] trit as like if you want to go fast, go\n[01:47:09] on your own. If you want to go far, go\n[01:47:10] with other people. That I don't know,\n[01:47:12] you can probably with enough resilience,\n[01:47:14] if you're the David Gogggins of\n[01:47:15] suffering, you can just [ __ ] grit\n[01:47:16] your teeth and make it to 80 and you'd\n[01:47:18] have you'd have done fine. But it'll be\n[01:47:19] way less fun. M like if you want to have\n[01:47:22] fun, do it with other people.\n[01:47:23] >> So not only you more effective, it's\n[01:47:25] also it's also more fun\n[01:47:27] >> and it's easier.\n[01:47:28] >> So you can get you let's say that you\n[01:47:30] can get it done, but you would have it\n[01:47:31] be done with more discomfort, more\n[01:47:33] self-doubt and yeah, you get to\n[01:47:37] celebrate this [ __ ] thing. You get to\n[01:47:39] celebrate whatever it is that you're\n[01:47:40] doing with other people. There's a great\n[01:47:41] line of um you know the whole Gladwell\n[01:47:43] concept of 10,000 hours which has been\n[01:47:44] debated but even in that context there\n[01:47:48] if you meet with smart friend and\n[01:47:49] discuss these issues you've now got\n[01:47:51] 20,000 hours because you got their\n[01:47:52] 10,000 hours if you have 10 people you\n[01:47:54] have 100,000 hours and you can see where\n[01:47:56] this is going.\n[01:47:57] >> Be as friends with as many people as\n[01:47:58] possible.\n[01:47:59] >> Okay. Uh you got any assignments to\n[01:48:02] finish off with? You got anything you\n[01:48:03] really wish that you'd said?\n[01:48:04] >> I have a I have a little hack that I\n[01:48:06] found useful.\n[01:48:07] >> Right. It's so it's being more practical\n[01:48:11] with gratitude, practical ways to to\n[01:48:14] engineer that feeling because I I've\n[01:48:15] always struggled with that. I don't know\n[01:48:16] about you guys, the whole like write\n[01:48:18] three things you're grateful for, but\n[01:48:19] you end up writing the same stuff. So,\n[01:48:21] one's a question that you can ask daily\n[01:48:22] and one is a thing that you do one time.\n[01:48:24] The one time is ask GPT or whatever your\n[01:48:29] AI choice is. So, so say I am 35. I live\n[01:48:35] in this city, this whatever. Describe a\n[01:48:39] Monday a 100 years ago.\n[01:48:41] >> And the level of you just need to read\n[01:48:44] it once and you're like, \"Oh my god.\"\n[01:48:46] Like heating,\n[01:48:47] >> not having to eat like spam for dinner,\n[01:48:51] >> not having to navigate through like a\n[01:48:53] world war and all these things and you\n[01:48:55] just suddenly see like little things in\n[01:48:57] your day\n[01:48:58] >> that you can a microwave completely take\n[01:49:00] for granted. You're like, \"Wow,\n[01:49:03] >> you sent me that passage. Is that what\n[01:49:04] you've just got up?\n[01:49:05] >> No, I was which passage you going to\n[01:49:06] refer to?\n[01:49:07] >> Uh where water like I had a shower, I\n[01:49:12] woke up in a comfy bed and I did\n[01:49:14] something else and you compared it to a\n[01:49:15] queen, an emperor and a\n[01:49:17] >> just I mean I could do a six-hour series\n[01:49:20] on this, right?\n[01:49:22] >> Even just study any part of history and\n[01:49:24] you realize everything's so much worse\n[01:49:26] than it is uh now. And also everybody's\n[01:49:28] always complaining.\n[01:49:30] >> So you kind of realize no matter how\n[01:49:31] much better it gets, everybody's going\n[01:49:32] to always be complaining. I mean, you\n[01:49:33] study World War II, it's not even that\n[01:49:35] long ago, and you go, hold most of the\n[01:49:37] people like we would have been on the\n[01:49:38] front lines. Here's a crazy stat. The\n[01:49:40] average age of the Luftwaffer that were\n[01:49:42] bombing the UK was 26. The average age\n[01:49:45] of the RAF pilots is the reason why this\n[01:49:47] isn't modern wisdom is\n[01:49:52] reason why we're not all speaking\n[01:49:53] German, you'd be fine with a blonde\n[01:49:54] hair, blue eyes,\n[01:49:55] >> is the average age of an RAF pilot, 21.\n[01:49:58] And you know how averages work. there's\n[01:50:00] going to be a few of us BS that are\n[01:50:01] bringing that age up like and you just\n[01:50:03] kind of go oh my god like it's it's\n[01:50:05] never ending um how much better it's\n[01:50:09] gotten but how much people will still\n[01:50:11] keep complaining. I have a just a little\n[01:50:13] twist on the gratitude thing because I\n[01:50:15] did in that bedroom there the time\n[01:50:17] capsule from you know the last decade of\n[01:50:20] my life. There is nine or 10 six minutee\n[01:50:25] diaries and there 6 months each. So it's\n[01:50:29] a lot of daily writing and the gratitude\n[01:50:32] never got below the neck for me and that\n[01:50:34] sounds great and I'm sure that it you\n[01:50:36] know it's shocking. The question I would\n[01:50:38] ask that I would get you ask yourself is\n[01:50:40] does this feel like I'm feeling it or is\n[01:50:44] it just another sort of cognitive\n[01:50:46] thought experiment?\n[01:50:47] >> Well, so this is my second one.\n[01:50:49] >> Beautiful. So that that's the that's up\n[01:50:51] without knowing.\n[01:50:51] >> Yeah, I did. That's like the the you\n[01:50:53] know shift the canvas. It's like oh all\n[01:50:55] these things I take for granted. How\n[01:50:57] nice.\n[01:50:58] >> The the second question that you can ask\n[01:51:00] yourself every day is which I think I\n[01:51:02] might have mentioned before. It's just\n[01:51:03] what would what would 80-year-old me\n[01:51:06] have appreciated about my day today?\n[01:51:09] >> And that's stuff like I got to walk to\n[01:51:12] the shop and buy a drink and walk back\n[01:51:15] again without nothing hurt or like I'm\n[01:51:18] at this part of my relationship with my\n[01:51:20] partner and we got to do this and we've\n[01:51:22] got all these plans and all these things\n[01:51:23] to be excited about and we have a\n[01:51:25] holiday coming up and I get to go with\n[01:51:27] whatever. That's the stuff that I I\n[01:51:29] feel. I think that's the way that like I\n[01:51:32] really struggle with write three things\n[01:51:33] you're grateful for, but I find that\n[01:51:35] question you pick you pick the stuff you\n[01:51:38] would ignore because it's the stuff that\n[01:51:41] when you're 80 just won't be there\n[01:51:42] anymore\n[01:51:43] >> that you overlook which is that's what\n[01:51:46] 80 80-year-old you will be grateful for.\n[01:51:48] >> What do you think those biggest things\n[01:51:49] 8-year-old Johnny will be thinking?\n[01:51:51] >> I think it's the I think it's the\n[01:51:54] feeling of excitement about what's still\n[01:51:58] coming.\n[01:52:00] that like my daughter's a certain age\n[01:52:02] and getting to see her grow up like\n[01:52:04] friendships, watching people achieve\n[01:52:06] things, there's so much to be still be\n[01:52:08] excited for and not not to say that\n[01:52:09] doesn't that goes away when you're 80,\n[01:52:10] but I think you're facing very different\n[01:52:13] a very different 10 years when you're 80\n[01:52:14] years old.\n[01:52:15] >> Have you heard that quote the quote from\n[01:52:17] an Whitehead uh civilization advances by\n[01:52:21] extending the number of operations we\n[01:52:23] can perform without thinking of them? So\n[01:52:25] like Johnny from 100 years ago doesn't\n[01:52:28] like would Johnny from now doesn't have\n[01:52:30] to go up the mountain and milk the goats\n[01:52:32] and then like wash the clothes in the um\n[01:52:37] the wooden pot and all this kind of\n[01:52:39] stuff um and therefore can do stuff at\n[01:52:42] much higher orders of operation. That\n[01:52:45] that uh famous email from Steve Jobs, I\n[01:52:49] grow little of the food I eat uh and of\n[01:52:51] the little I do grow, I didn't breed or\n[01:52:52] perfect the seeds. I didn't make any of\n[01:52:54] my own clothing. I speak a language I\n[01:52:56] didn't invent or refine. I did not\n[01:52:58] discover the mathematics that I use. I'm\n[01:53:00] protected by freedoms and laws I didn't\n[01:53:02] conceive of or legislate, etc., etc. And\n[01:53:04] then it's like at the end it's sent from\n[01:53:06] my iPad.\n[01:53:08] Like just a little hat tick of like\n[01:53:10] we're standing on the shoulders of\n[01:53:12] giants.\n[01:53:13] >> Yeah. Yeah, that's good. The the\n[01:53:15] gratitude thing is hard to get right. Um\n[01:53:18] certainly\n[01:53:18] >> try the Janna stuff. Give that a go.\n[01:53:21] >> The panic attack of happiness. Yeah.\n[01:53:22] Panic attack of joy. see what happens.\n[01:53:23] It's Michael, the guy from earlier. I'll\n[01:53:24] put you in touch with him. What do you\n[01:53:26] guys think? 80-year-old you will be\n[01:53:28] grateful for.\n[01:53:32] >> For me, the obvious one I was reading\n[01:53:36] this um chess clock. It's called Yeah.\n[01:53:42] >> Alfred.\n[01:53:42] >> Yeah.\n[01:53:44] The I was reading there's this book\n[01:53:46] called Ken. It's by Kenloo. Um, so he\n[01:53:49] does these short stories and there's one\n[01:53:51] called Paper Menagerie and kind of the\n[01:53:54] ending is um he's reading a letter from\n[01:53:57] his mom after she's died and it's a\n[01:53:59] Chinese family and they say the saddest\n[01:54:01] the saddest feeling in Chinese culture\n[01:54:03] is to grow of an age where you're ready\n[01:54:05] to take care of your parents and realize\n[01:54:08] they're no longer there. So that's\n[01:54:10] probably the one that I think I'd be\n[01:54:12] like, \"Oh, wow. My parents are still\n[01:54:13] here.\"\n[01:54:13] >> Mhm.\n[01:54:14] >> Oh, that's cool. That's cool. M I like\n[01:54:17] the song by Kenloo as well. Uh like\n[01:54:20] Kenlu\n[01:54:22] Kenu\n[01:54:26] Kenloo.\n[01:54:27] You know that one?\n[01:54:30] >> But it's going to be Christmas number\n[01:54:31] one after that rendition.\n[01:54:32] >> Jesus Christ.\n[01:54:35] Wow. Okay. Yousef, anything beyond that?\n[01:54:37] I don't know how you're going to top it.\n[01:54:40] >> Yeah. So, I've got\n[01:54:44] um and sorry for derailing your your\n[01:54:47] hack there, Johnny. Um\n[01:54:50] >> I've got some like micro ones, but\n[01:54:52] obviously Johnny and my hacks are so\n[01:54:53] similar that in knowing I had this\n[01:54:57] episode coming up. I went through my\n[01:54:58] Obsidian, which um has definitely passed\n[01:55:00] the the Watson filter, still using it.\n[01:55:04] Um and looked up my George folder and\n[01:55:08] thought I just need to celebrate a few\n[01:55:11] of the hacks that I've stolen from\n[01:55:12] George and have served me well. So, the\n[01:55:14] boardroom exercise,\n[01:55:17] which is basically you're sat at a\n[01:55:21] boardroom in your mind when your mind is\n[01:55:24] too busy and you go, \"Okay, I've got\n[01:55:26] different versions of myself all around\n[01:55:29] the board.\" So, you might have like the\n[01:55:32] finance accountant version of you with\n[01:55:34] the green cap and the cigar, or you have\n[01:55:36] like the romance version of you with the\n[01:55:37] rose in the teeth and the um the gym\n[01:55:40] version of you or whatever. all these\n[01:55:42] different kind of mini personas and you\n[01:55:44] just give them all a chance to have\n[01:55:46] their say. So you're like, \"Everyone\n[01:55:48] else shut up. You You've got 5 minutes.\n[01:55:51] Take the floor. Voice what you need to\n[01:55:54] say.\" And as you work your way around,\n[01:55:56] you just clear out the pipes and it's\n[01:55:58] just the the quietest that your mind\n[01:56:01] will ever be. So George, thank you for\n[01:56:04] that one. um\n[01:56:07] framing\n[01:56:09] decisions as experiments.\n[01:56:11] Big one I've learned from from him this\n[01:56:14] this year of\n[01:56:16] rather than um deliberating over a\n[01:56:19] decision that is a two-way door, you can\n[01:56:21] just treat it as an experiment and then\n[01:56:22] it just gets rid of any sense of like,\n[01:56:25] oh, I've got to get this right.\n[01:56:30] Final three.\n[01:56:35] I'll take them\n[01:56:37] >> unless there's any uh comments or\n[01:56:39] questions on on those so far.\n[01:56:41] >> Keep going.\n[01:56:43] >> Okay. This is difficult because I've\n[01:56:44] just for people's reference, I've got no\n[01:56:46] like visual feedback. So, I'm just like\n[01:56:48] talking to myself.\n[01:56:48] >> We're having a great time. We're living\n[01:56:49] it.\n[01:56:50] >> Hicha. So, if you like coffee\n[01:56:55] but you're weaning yourself off, you can\n[01:56:58] go decaf, but also hija is roasted\n[01:57:00] matcha. It's got that kind of caramelly\n[01:57:04] chocolatey type taste but with much\n[01:57:07] lower caffeine. Same level of theine as\n[01:57:10] matcha tea. So becoming more popular.\n[01:57:14] Lovely drink. Very uh very wholesome\n[01:57:17] especially in the winter time or you can\n[01:57:20] have it cold iced. So, Picha\n[01:57:23] um\n[01:57:25] using voice notes as a trigger to go\n[01:57:29] outside either listening to or recording\n[01:57:32] voice notes. I've just set myself a rule\n[01:57:34] where I have to be walking around to\n[01:57:37] send or receive a voice note. Just stops\n[01:57:40] me from being a slug at my desk and,\n[01:57:44] you know, it just gets me up and out.\n[01:57:47] Um,\n[01:57:50] the final one's a little bit long, so I\n[01:57:52] might get a thumb next.\n[01:57:55] However, um,\n[01:57:57] >> all right, I'll uh I'll steamroll\n[01:58:00] through my last few. Uh, take a photo of\n[01:58:02] the room key slip with your room number\n[01:58:04] on it when you check into a hotel.\n[01:58:06] >> Good one. Just as you get it, just have\n[01:58:08] your phone out, take a photo of it. Then\n[01:58:10] I've been on tour a lot. I've been\n[01:58:11] through oh god 50 or 100 hotels maybe in\n[01:58:16] the last couple of years and uh you\n[01:58:19] especially if you're going back to back\n[01:58:20] to back there is no way you can remember\n[01:58:21] your room number. I've been lost. I've\n[01:58:23] had to go back down to not lose my room\n[01:58:25] key but to just be reminded of what room\n[01:58:26] I'm in. Um and that's a particularly\n[01:58:30] embarrassing one. So just take a photo\n[01:58:31] of the room key. Uh Uber Black XL in\n[01:58:34] America. They don't do it in the UK.\n[01:58:35] Uber Black XL is so nice if you're in\n[01:58:37] the States. It gets a big Escalade or a\n[01:58:40] Ford Explorer or something with a guy in\n[01:58:42] a suit. And it's usually maybe twice the\n[01:58:44] price, two and a half times the price of\n[01:58:45] a normal Uber. So, probably not good for\n[01:58:47] big journeys. But if you're out with\n[01:58:49] some friends, if this is a dicky one\n[01:58:52] from your uh birthday in Miami that he\n[01:58:55] used, it's just such a nicer experience.\n[01:58:57] If you got four people, four people will\n[01:58:59] go in an Uber X, but it'll be pain. Uber\n[01:59:02] XL, you've still got bags of room. We\n[01:59:05] used two Uber XL's as our tour band\n[01:59:07] basically for all of tour with the\n[01:59:08] soundboard and everything else that we\n[01:59:10] needed to take. Uh, and then the last\n[01:59:12] one is a quote from France Kfka in 1912\n[01:59:16] and it's basically\n[01:59:18] a summation of all of the life hacks\n[01:59:21] that we've ever done. It's a\n[01:59:23] distillation of everything that you need\n[01:59:25] to do in your life. So France Kafka in\n[01:59:27] 1912, dearest, I beg of you, sleep\n[01:59:31] properly and go for walks.\n[01:59:35] I think it's so great.\n[01:59:38] >> It's a single sentence for how you can\n[01:59:40] probably get most things better in your\n[01:59:42] life.\n[01:59:43] >> Yeah.\n[01:59:44] >> Well, everything's better with those two\n[01:59:46] things. Sleep properly and go for walks.\n[01:59:48] Double do.\n[01:59:48] >> That's the first entry in his in his day\n[01:59:50] one that he's looking back on 20 years\n[01:59:53] later and still haven't slept properly\n[01:59:55] or gone for enough walks.\n[01:59:57] >> You got anything left?\n[01:59:58] >> Uh yeah, I'll speed through. We a little\n[02:00:01] speed round then. Um number one um is I\n[02:00:07] told you about my um if I become the\n[02:00:09] chancellor of the excheer how I would\n[02:00:11] increase the GDP by 3% overnight. I\n[02:00:14] would install large whiteboards in\n[02:00:16] everybody's home. So I think just having\n[02:00:18] a large whiteboard always there. There's\n[02:00:20] that like it's Kidlin's law of um if you\n[02:00:22] could if you can state a problem clearly\n[02:00:24] you've already solved it by 50%. And my\n[02:00:27] kind of uh twist on that is when you\n[02:00:29] have a whiteboard it's actually 70%.\n[02:00:31] because it kind of stays there staring\n[02:00:33] back at you and eats part of your\n[02:00:34] subconscious. That's number one. Number\n[02:00:37] two, and I want to make sure that I get\n[02:00:40] a bit of context here cuz it does sound\n[02:00:42] stupid this one, but let me just test\n[02:00:44] the room.\n[02:00:46] One thing I discovered during COVID, I\n[02:00:48] would do a lot of text messages, a lot\n[02:00:50] of voice memos, and a lot of scheduled\n[02:00:51] Zoom calls. How often do you just\n[02:00:53] randomly ring a friend?\n[02:00:56] >> I actually do that quite regularly.\n[02:00:57] >> You do it quite a bit.\n[02:00:58] >> Yeah.\n[02:00:59] >> Never. Never. And I found myself and I\n[02:01:01] think there's probably a lot of people\n[02:01:02] that listen to the show that do that as\n[02:01:04] well where it's like, \"Hey mate, do you\n[02:01:05] want to chat tomorrow at 9?\" And it's\n[02:01:07] that, you know, that meme of there's two\n[02:01:09] guys, one's trying to stab the other,\n[02:01:10] and it's like me and like one schedule\n[02:01:12] call my entire day versus I will just\n[02:01:16] randomly pick up the That's been my\n[02:01:17] thing like this year is to just randomly\n[02:01:19] ring people um whenever, like a nutcase,\n[02:01:22] and just check in on friends cuz you\n[02:01:23] just stop doing it. I go, I've not\n[02:01:24] actually had a phone call with a friend\n[02:01:25] for 18 months. What's your pickup rate?\n[02:01:27] Hm. What's the pickup rate on the calls?\n[02:01:29] >> Uh about 30 40%.\n[02:01:31] >> Okay.\n[02:01:31] >> Yeah. And then and then when you factor\n[02:01:33] in dial backs, it's like 70 to 80%.\n[02:01:35] >> And you just end up having conversations\n[02:01:37] that you wouldn't have and it leads to\n[02:01:38] that kind of deep spre\n[02:01:40] deep anxiety in Johnny though. It's the\n[02:01:42] reason he doesn't text back too quickly.\n[02:01:45] >> Yeah. Well, that's a separate\n[02:01:46] conversation. The hack for the hack. Go\n[02:01:48] on. Double dial.\n[02:01:50] >> What do you mean?\n[02:01:51] >> Ring him again straight away.\n[02:01:52] >> Okay.\n[02:01:53] >> That that makes it feel like emergency.\n[02:01:55] >> So if Exactly. So they'll answer. So, if\n[02:01:57] I rang you once,\n[02:01:58] >> but it's not an emergency,\n[02:02:00] >> but it doesn't matter,\n[02:02:00] >> right? So, you've got to assume one of\n[02:02:02] two things. I'm either actually not\n[02:02:05] available, in which case the double dial\n[02:02:07] isn't going to work,\n[02:02:08] >> or I am available, but I'm busy,\n[02:02:10] >> which means that the second one just\n[02:02:12] pushes through a threshold\n[02:02:14] >> to a level of severity that is\n[02:02:16] inappropriate for what you're trying to\n[02:02:17] do.\n[02:02:18] >> And by all you've done there is optimize\n[02:02:21] your pickup rate on the first time you\n[02:02:24] call them. But future times they're\n[02:02:26] going to go, \"Oh, that's double dial\n[02:02:27] Johnny.\"\n[02:02:29] >> Yeah. Meanwhile, his house is on fire.\n[02:02:31] >> Yeah.\n[02:02:31] >> Okay. So, you're worried about Boy Who\n[02:02:33] Cried Real Wolf because Okay. And also,\n[02:02:35] you've I think it's al it's more it's\n[02:02:37] more a fun conversation, right? That's\n[02:02:39] the whole game there is to have more\n[02:02:40] fun.\n[02:02:41] >> Start me off as have fun. I don't need\n[02:02:43] to like optimize my conversion rate on a\n[02:02:45] chat.\n[02:02:45] >> But you want to speak to more people\n[02:02:46] surely.\n[02:02:47] >> Then you just pick call somebody else.\n[02:02:48] Yeah. They'll ring back or you call\n[02:02:49] somebody else.\n[02:02:50] >> Yeah. Just go. I go on the area manual\n[02:02:52] style. I think this has touched a nerve\n[02:02:54] in you guys. I feel like if you're going\n[02:02:56] to ring someone, ring them twice. Like\n[02:02:57] if you're going to ring them, you want\n[02:02:58] to speak to them.\n[02:02:59] >> So ring again.\n[02:03:00] >> You're sounding very entitled.\n[02:03:03] >> Well, I think it's entitled to ring\n[02:03:04] someone.\n[02:03:04] >> I'm going to call you so many times\n[02:03:06] after this.\n[02:03:07] >> If you double dial\n[02:03:11] the point, the point is, right, you ring\n[02:03:12] someone cuz you're trying to get in\n[02:03:13] touch with them. So act like you're\n[02:03:14] trying to get in touch with them.\n[02:03:15] >> But this is not like a formal\n[02:03:17] conversation. It's very like what's up?\n[02:03:19] What's going on?\n[02:03:19] >> Fine. You you guys are inferring that if\n[02:03:22] I ring twice it's an emergency, but I'm\n[02:03:24] just trying to speak to you,\n[02:03:25] >> which is the purpose of the first call.\n[02:03:28] >> Always be closing.\n[02:03:30] >> Always be calling.\n[02:03:31] >> Um,\n[02:03:36] >> uh, anything else? Um, let's do I mean\n[02:03:39] Yousef mentioned it then. Let's do some\n[02:03:41] fun ones of just um creating your own\n[02:03:43] language um that no one else speaks.\n[02:03:48] So you need subtitles on for the rest of\n[02:03:50] this part. But no, um just like changing\n[02:03:52] words. So um Yousef mentioned not using\n[02:03:55] decision, using the word experiment, and\n[02:03:57] you realize, oh, when you use that,\n[02:03:58] you're light on yourself. But also the\n[02:04:00] best part about it is you tell everybody\n[02:04:01] else you run an experiment. You say,\n[02:04:02] hey, I'm going to move to this place.\n[02:04:04] Oh, it's a big decision. Everybody kind\n[02:04:05] of reflexively\n[02:04:06] >> acts like it's a big decision. It's\n[02:04:08] Capil Gut, a stand-up comedian who goes\n[02:04:10] on stage. One version of him immediately\n[02:04:12] apologizes after the offensive joke. The\n[02:04:14] crowd picks up on it. The other version\n[02:04:15] just kind of laughs it through and goes,\n[02:04:16] \"What you guys worried about?\" It's not\n[02:04:18] considered. Have you considered though\n[02:04:19] that there might be some decisions that\n[02:04:21] warrant you taking them seriously and\n[02:04:24] also warrant sort of a serious reception\n[02:04:27] and your making light of it may cause\n[02:04:29] your friends to be a bit more blas than\n[02:04:32] is warranted. Perhaps you shouldn't try\n[02:04:33] and base jump for the first time ever\n[02:04:35] off that cliff.\n[02:04:36] >> Yeah, I mean now it's said it was going\n[02:04:39] to be funny. He was having a laugh.\n[02:04:40] >> Yeah, I mean I'll transfer that about my\n[02:04:43] 20 children I've just had. No, I mean\n[02:04:46] >> I mean there's a little bit of a I\n[02:04:47] always find these these conversations a\n[02:04:49] bit like it's like somebody's so far\n[02:04:51] this way, right? Somebody's so\n[02:04:53] overthinking like what they're going to\n[02:04:54] order from a dinner menu to then like,\n[02:04:56] oh, maybe don't just have three kids\n[02:04:58] with three different women. It's like\n[02:04:59] it's like the, you know, the classic\n[02:05:01] thing of you have a a female friend who\n[02:05:02] says, \"Oh, I don't want to go to the\n[02:05:03] gym. I'm going to get too bulky.\" And\n[02:05:04] it's like, I've been trying that for\n[02:05:06] years and I can't do it with 10 times\n[02:05:08] the testosterone. So I don't think\n[02:05:09] you've got to worry about somebody going\n[02:05:11] from not being able this is specifically\n[02:05:13] for people that are struggling with\n[02:05:14] decisions like the decisions that are\n[02:05:16] reversible labeling them as experiments\n[02:05:19] is useful. Um, other one is if I say the\n[02:05:22] word problem, what's the kind of\n[02:05:23] emotional reaction that you get?\n[02:05:26] >> Constriction.\n[02:05:26] >> Constriction.\n[02:05:27] >> Yeah.\n[02:05:28] >> Pain, frustration. If I say the word\n[02:05:30] puzzle,\n[02:05:31] >> excitement,\n[02:05:32] >> pain, frust.\n[02:05:40] >> Um, I'm working on a new one for the\n[02:05:43] news.\n[02:05:44] >> I've been thinking about cuz like the\n[02:05:45] news is just\n[02:05:46] >> because of all of the news that you can\n[02:05:47] see. So, you want to call it the gel\n[02:05:48] man's cuz you know gel man amnesia\n[02:05:50] >> or the uh the currents or the uh wrongs\n[02:05:54] cuz it's just\n[02:05:54] >> do you remember when you tried do you\n[02:05:55] remember cuz you've been you've been\n[02:05:56] doing this for as long as I've known\n[02:05:58] you've been doing this for nearly 8\n[02:05:59] years now. Remember when you tried to\n[02:06:01] rename the\n[02:06:04] un toilet bowl hit pee\n[02:06:08] >> no\n[02:06:09] >> that drops on the seat.\n[02:06:11] >> I didn't try and rename that. I tried to\n[02:06:13] give it a name cuz it didn't have a\n[02:06:14] name.\n[02:06:14] >> Okay.\n[02:06:15] >> Cuz I\n[02:06:15] >> What was it? Can you remember the name?\n[02:06:17] Yeah, it's catchy, right?\n[02:06:18] >> It's uh it's fly dripping rather than\n[02:06:20] fly tipping.\n[02:06:22] >> It doesn't have a name.\n[02:06:23] >> Think about I've got an AMX in there\n[02:06:27] with 16 digits on the front. Haven't\n[02:06:29] been able to recall it. Must have used\n[02:06:31] it 200 times in the last couple of\n[02:06:33] years. I can recall fly dripping. M the\n[02:06:37] fact that my brain has decided to hook\n[02:06:39] itself into the name for piss on a\n[02:06:42] toilet bowl but not the 16-digit number\n[02:06:45] which is in between me and maybe getting\n[02:06:47] out of a third world jail cell.\n[02:06:49] >> It's also the name for piss on a toilet\n[02:06:51] bowl that three people in the world\n[02:06:53] would recognize.\n[02:06:55] >> Many more now.\n[02:06:56] >> Well, um so there's just I mean probably\n[02:06:58] a good one to finish on is um book\n[02:07:01] recommendations specifically around\n[02:07:02] language. So there's a book called the\n[02:07:04] Ethmologicon which is where I got a lot\n[02:07:05] of this stuff from. There's a\n[02:07:06] >> bloke.\n[02:07:08] He's amazing. So he has this line in\n[02:07:10] here where he's chatting about Milton\n[02:07:12] and this guy invented the following\n[02:07:13] words. Right? This is how generative\n[02:07:16] this man was. Impassive, obtrusive,\n[02:07:18] jubilant, lequacious, unconvincing,\n[02:07:20] satanic, persona, fragrance,\n[02:07:22] belleaguered, sensus, undesirable,\n[02:07:24] disregard, damp, criticize,\n[02:07:26] irresponsible, love, exhilarating,\n[02:07:28] sectarian, unaccountable, incidental,\n[02:07:30] and cooking. He created all those for\n[02:07:32] his words. fly dripping. You got to keep\n[02:07:34] churning them out there and\n[02:07:35] >> have you seen Shakespeare as equivalent?\n[02:07:36] >> No.\n[02:07:37] >> Insane. The words the number of words\n[02:07:40] that Shakespeare created which are part\n[02:07:42] of common parliament now is wild.\n[02:07:43] >> But it's weird. We just accept language\n[02:07:45] as it is. A fun one is from that book is\n[02:07:47] where the word and it's Christmas\n[02:07:48] related is where the word Turkey comes\n[02:07:50] from. So we think it's basically because\n[02:07:53] it's the it came from Turkey. But\n[02:07:55] interestingly in Turkey they call it um\n[02:07:58] essentially uh Hindu referencing to\n[02:08:00] India. So it didn't come from Turkey and\n[02:08:02] it didn't come from India but it's this\n[02:08:04] whole chain that exists. So Turkey did\n[02:08:06] not come from Turkey.\n[02:08:06] >> I remember in that book because I've got\n[02:08:08] the paperback of that same book next to\n[02:08:09] my bed after you recommended it. And um\n[02:08:12] [ __ ] comes from uh German words. Is it\n[02:08:15] shy? Um but there's a couple of\n[02:08:19] interesting potential explanations for\n[02:08:22] it. One of them being store high in\n[02:08:25] transit. So if you had manure and you\n[02:08:27] were taking it on a ship, you wouldn't\n[02:08:29] want it down low where people could\n[02:08:30] smell it. you'd want it in one of the\n[02:08:31] higher um storage units, store high in\n[02:08:35] transit. It's one of these uh situations\n[02:08:37] where I guess you get kind of a\n[02:08:38] chachillian drift explanation that's\n[02:08:41] culpable but wrong.\n[02:08:43] >> Uh because posh is port out starboard\n[02:08:47] home and it was also to do with the\n[02:08:49] sides of the ship that uh the upper\n[02:08:52] class were going to be put on. But\n[02:08:53] storeh high in transit. Uh Mark Falsy on\n[02:08:55] the show soon. Seth, you got anything\n[02:08:57] before we leave or are you going to join\n[02:08:59] us in saying goodbye in Malaysia?\n[02:09:02] >> Yeah, I wish I could be with you guys,\n[02:09:04] but um glad to at least have a a seat on\n[02:09:07] the laptop.\n[02:09:08] >> You've been sat on a You look really\n[02:09:09] comfy. You've been on one of the the\n[02:09:11] cushions in the corner for the entire\n[02:09:12] the entire episode. Uh that's it, ladies\n[02:09:14] and gentlemen. Merry Christmas from us\n[02:09:17] here. This is cool to be able to do this\n[02:09:19] again every year, every winter time back\n[02:09:21] in Newcastle where we first started\n[02:09:23] doing this podcast coming up on 8 years\n[02:09:25] ago now. Uh\n[02:09:28] have a good period, eat everything that\n[02:09:30] you can. Take some time off and do a\n[02:09:32] little bit of reading and review in\n[02:09:33] between now and the new year. I know\n[02:09:35] it's super duper intense, but uh I think\n[02:09:38] it's a\n[02:09:40] if used right, it's a really nice\n[02:09:41] period. Some people get sad around this\n[02:09:43] time of the year, but it's the shortest\n[02:09:45] day of the year. just went 21st. So,\n[02:09:47] it's like typical stuff gets dark and\n[02:09:50] then it gets lighter. So, I hope that\n[02:09:52] our touchyfey life hacks and lessons has\n[02:09:55] uh kept you appropriately festive. I\n[02:09:57] know all of us except for Yousef cuz\n[02:09:58] he's selfish and in a different country.\n[02:10:00] Uh we we dressed up appropriately. So,\n[02:10:03] anything to say or are we done?\n[02:10:05] >> We're done. Merry Christmas. Merry\n[02:10:07] Christmas. Give some love to your family\n[02:10:08] members or if you're in Malaysia, family\n[02:10:10] member, family member.\n[02:10:16] Excellent.\n[02:10:17] >> Merry Christmas everyone.\n[02:10:18] >> Merry Christmas.\n[02:10:20] >> Unreal. Let's go.\n[02:10:25] >> Congratulations. You made it to the end\n[02:10:27] of an episode. Your brain has not been\n[02:10:29] completely destroyed by the internet\n[02:10:31] just yet.
