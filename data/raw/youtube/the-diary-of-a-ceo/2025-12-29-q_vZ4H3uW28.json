  "transcript": "[00:00] Stop taking life so seriously. No one is\n[00:02] getting out of this game alive. And in\n[00:03] three generations, no one will even\n[00:05] remember your name. And if that doesn't\n[00:07] give you liberation to just drop your\n[00:10] problems for a moment and find some joy,\n[00:13] I don't know what will because there'll\n[00:14] never be a time when there's no problems\n[00:15] in life. And that's why this time in\n[00:16] between Christmas and New Year is a\n[00:18] really wonderful time to plan big dreams\n[00:19] and goals for the year.\n[00:21] >> So, let's talk about that.\n[00:22] >> Chris Williamson is one of the world's\n[00:24] leading podcast hosts and thinkers. And\n[00:26] now he's back\n[00:27] >> educating us on how to build discipline,\n[00:29] turning goals into results, what's\n[00:30] stopping us finding love,\n[00:31] >> and what makes a good man in today's\n[00:33] society?\n[00:34] >> The single best question to work out\n[00:36] what you should be doing next year, what\n[00:37] would have to happen by the end of 2026.\n[00:39] For me to look back and consider it a\n[00:41] success and it usually comes down to\n[00:43] only a few things. The first one is in\n[00:44] order to pick something up, you have to\n[00:46] put something down. So setting the bar\n[00:47] unrealistically high does not increase\n[00:49] your performance. Like you probably lose\n[00:51] 20 lb and get a boyfriend. You can't do\n[00:53] that and move cities and start a new\n[00:55] business. So, make the assumption, I can\n[00:57] do no more than I'm doing now. Second\n[01:00] thing, if your life was a movie and the\n[01:01] audience were watching, what would they\n[01:03] be screaming at the screen telling you\n[01:05] to do with your life? It is obvious.\n[01:07] Leave the relationship. The job is not\n[01:09] working for you. The killer's hiding in\n[01:11] the cupboard. Because if you're not\n[01:12] careful with how you design what it is\n[01:14] that you chase after, you can spend your\n[01:16] entire life realizing that you climbed a\n[01:18] huge ladder that was leaning up against\n[01:20] the wrong wall.\n[01:20] >> And is there anything else? So there is\n[01:23] a wonderful upside in trying to conquer\n[01:25] and trying to achieve mastery, trying to\n[01:27] really drive yourself to go and do\n[01:28] stuff. But I'm not like your feelings,\n[01:30] just hustle and grind until your eyes\n[01:31] bleed either because one of the biggest\n[01:33] lessons I've taken away from this year\n[01:34] is suppression isn't the same thing as\n[01:36] strength. And it's a good thing for guys\n[01:38] who feel their emotions to show that\n[01:41] they feel their emotions, right? Like\n[01:43] I've been at some of my lowest points\n[01:44] over the last 12 months. It felt like my\n[01:46] better self was slipping through my\n[01:48] fingers. I realized my emotions are\n[01:51] legitimate and denying myself that is\n[01:55] not helping anything at all. What\n[01:57] happened?\n[02:06] >> I see messages all the time in the\n[02:08] comment section that some of you didn't\n[02:09] realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you\n[02:11] could do me a favor and double check if\n[02:13] you're a subscriber to this channel,\n[02:14] that would be tremendously appreciated.\n[02:15] It's the simple, it's the free thing\n[02:17] that anybody that watches this show\n[02:19] frequently can do to help us here to\n[02:20] keep everything going in this show in\n[02:22] the trajectory it's on. So, please do\n[02:24] double check if you've subscribed and uh\n[02:26] thank you so much because in a strange\n[02:27] way you are you're part of our history\n[02:30] and you're on this journey with us and I\n[02:31] appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank\n[02:33] you\n[02:37] Chris.\n[02:38] My audience care a lot about changing\n[02:41] their life for the better. And I think\n[02:42] at this time of year, change is front of\n[02:45] mind for everybody. Everybody's thinking\n[02:46] about New Year's resolutions, who I want\n[02:48] to become in 2026. But when you look at\n[02:50] the stats, 23% of people quit by the end\n[02:54] of the first week of January, their New\n[02:56] Year's resolution, the thing they aimed\n[02:57] at.\n[02:58] >> Roughly half of people will quit their\n[03:01] New Year's resolution, the change they\n[03:02] sought by the end of January. and only\n[03:05] about 9% of people will keep their New\n[03:07] Year's resolution for the full year. So\n[03:09] I guess my opening question to you is\n[03:11] does this time of year matter at all? Is\n[03:13] it a useful productive time to be\n[03:15] thinking about change in your point of\n[03:17] view? I think the world is split into\n[03:19] two camps. Uh one camp says there is no\n[03:22] difference between January 1st and\n[03:24] December 31st. Like why wait? It's\n[03:26] December 10th, just do it now. and the\n[03:28] other camp likes the idea of there being\n[03:31] a culturally appropriate moment to stop\n[03:33] doing something and start doing\n[03:34] something else. Most people need to\n[03:36] realize that they're already spending\n[03:39] tons of time worrying about the future\n[03:40] in the past. They're going back to this\n[03:42] thing that they regret. I wish I'd done\n[03:44] this differently. Oh, I I have uh uh\n[03:48] rumination about something that\n[03:50] occurred. I have a sense of uh\n[03:52] wistfulness for something that I've\n[03:54] maybe missed. I'm grief for something\n[03:55] that I've lost. Then they're concerned\n[03:57] about the future. They're thinking, \"I'm\n[03:59] uncertain about this thing that's going\n[04:00] to happen. I could plan. I could try and\n[04:02] come up with a solution for this.\" So,\n[04:03] you're already worrying about the past.\n[04:06] You're already doing reflection and\n[04:07] planning just in a very unstructured way\n[04:09] where you don't get to choose when it\n[04:10] hits you in the face.\n[04:12] This is a culturally appropriate moment,\n[04:16] like a scheduling appropriate moment for\n[04:19] you to just step in and think, okay, in\n[04:21] between Christmas and New Year, people\n[04:24] that work in retail, God bless you,\n[04:26] people that got to go back to work and\n[04:27] do that thing, but usually there's a bit\n[04:29] of downtime.\n[04:30] >> It's a little bit slower. It's Boxing\n[04:32] Day, chilling out on the couch, and\n[04:34] you're kind of thinking, \"Wow, I was\n[04:36] here again at mom and dad's house or\n[04:38] with the in-laws or whatever. What was I\n[04:41] doing last year? What was it like last\n[04:42] year? You're already in a little bit of\n[04:43] a reflective mode. There is no special\n[04:46] magic super secret squirrel source in\n[04:49] January 1st. But it is a good moment to\n[04:52] check in because life tends to slow down\n[04:54] a little bit. Work tends work uh time is\n[04:57] a little bit more slow and you're\n[04:59] already doing this. You're already\n[05:01] thinking about the past and the future\n[05:02] and this is just a good structured\n[05:04] opportunity to check in and do it. I\n[05:06] guess the the question that everybody\n[05:08] should be asking themselves is what\n[05:09] should I aim at? And and is there such a\n[05:12] thing as aiming at too many things? What\n[05:14] what what is a good goal for change? And\n[05:17] when you think about all the people\n[05:18] you've interviewed and the change you've\n[05:19] seen in your own life, what what does a\n[05:21] productive New Year's resolution or\n[05:22] productive goal sound like? And how do I\n[05:24] how do I get there?\n[05:25] >> Yeah. It's very overwhelming. Uh if you\n[05:28] realize, wow, I can do anything I want.\n[05:30] I could look at my entire life.\n[05:33] That's terrifying. That's absolutely\n[05:35] terrifying.\n[05:37] One thing I would say, this is your\n[05:39] opportunity to change anything\n[05:43] behaviorally. You can change anything\n[05:45] you want. Not everything you want.\n[05:47] Right? That's the problem. You can\n[05:49] become anything you want behaviorally,\n[05:51] but you can't be everything you want.\n[05:52] So, you need to pick a small number. The\n[05:55] single best question to work out what\n[05:56] you should be doing next year. what\n[05:58] would have to happen by the end of 2026\n[06:01] for me to look back on 2026 and consider\n[06:05] it a success. I think that really helps\n[06:08] to just give you a bit more perspective\n[06:10] and it usually comes down to only a few\n[06:12] things. You don't usually have so much\n[06:14] in your mind when you do that. Setting\n[06:17] the bar unrealistically high does not\n[06:20] increase your performance. Imagine this.\n[06:22] Imagine that you went into a buffet and\n[06:25] you made your plate as big as possible.\n[06:27] He said, \"I want all of these things.\n[06:28] I'm going to put all of this stuff on my\n[06:29] plate and my stomach is going to expand\n[06:32] to be able to fit it.\"\n[06:33] >> That's not the way that our stomachs\n[06:35] work and that is not the way that our\n[06:36] workloads work. So, first rule, in order\n[06:39] to pick something up, you have to put\n[06:41] something down.\n[06:43] Don't assume that just because you've\n[06:45] loaded more onto your workload plate,\n[06:48] your work capacity will expand to be\n[06:50] able to fit it into your stomach. That's\n[06:52] not the way that it works.\n[06:54] assume. Make the assumption I can do no\n[06:57] more than I'm doing now. I can switch\n[06:59] stuff, but I can't add more in. Maybe\n[07:03] you can. Maybe you're going to be able\n[07:04] to squeeze your phone time. Maybe you're\n[07:05] going to be able to become more\n[07:06] efficient, more productive, whatever.\n[07:08] But it's safer to just assume this is\n[07:10] the pie that I'm playing with. And in\n[07:12] order to pick something up, I have to\n[07:14] put something down. That's a really\n[07:15] important thing because at the moment\n[07:17] it's December 29th. I'm with I'm full of\n[07:21] gusto and motivation and I can't wait.\n[07:23] I'm going to crush it. And yeah, for the\n[07:25] first week, maybe you've got that. But\n[07:27] if you're using motivation and\n[07:29] enthusiasm to work yourself through your\n[07:31] goals, your goals are predicated largely\n[07:35] on a fuel source that you don't have\n[07:36] control over. Don't have a massive\n[07:38] amount of control over your motivation\n[07:40] over a long amount of time. Like it\n[07:41] comes and then it goes. You want\n[07:43] something that's a little bit more\n[07:44] rigid. So in order to pick something up,\n[07:46] you have to put something down. I think\n[07:47] that's a really important point because\n[07:49] when we think about the goals we'll\n[07:51] start setting at this time of the year,\n[07:52] all of them are asking for more time or\n[07:55] more energy. Like pretty much all of\n[07:57] them ask for I want to start running. I\n[07:58] want to start going to the gym. Whereas,\n[08:01] as you say, that means I'm going to have\n[08:02] to take something off the plate.\n[08:04] >> Yeah.\n[08:04] >> And we don't think about subtraction at\n[08:06] this time of the year. Typically, we\n[08:07] don't think I'm going to spend less time\n[08:10] with my friends. I'm going to cut out\n[08:13] Netflix. We think of addition. Mhm.\n[08:15] >> But logically there's still just just\n[08:17] the 24 hours in a day and that the\n[08:18] finite amount of body budget that we\n[08:20] have in terms of energy. So are you\n[08:22] saying that I have to create both an\n[08:25] addition and subtraction list and make\n[08:27] sure that they equal out they net out to\n[08:29] zero?\n[08:29] >> That would be optimal. I think one\n[08:32] question that you really should be\n[08:33] asking yourself. Let's go through a\n[08:35] bunch of uncomfortable questions people\n[08:36] can ask themselves. That could be cool.\n[08:38] >> Okay.\n[08:40] How would I spend my day if I wanted to\n[08:42] make 85year-old me as miserable as\n[08:44] possible?\n[08:45] >> What is it that I did over the last year\n[08:46] that made me right now\n[08:49] feel\n[08:51] it's this constriction.\n[08:53] >> Okay.\n[08:53] >> I I I don't like I don't like my\n[08:55] relationship with my phone. I spend a\n[08:56] lot of time on my phone. I don't like\n[08:59] how uh my mornings aren't very\n[09:01] productive. Uh I've noticed that when\n[09:03] I'm with my friends, I'm not very\n[09:05] present. I've noticed that I spend a lot\n[09:06] of time on my own. I tend to isolate\n[09:07] when things get difficult. I've noticed\n[09:10] that I've got into the habit of not\n[09:12] telling the truth when people ask me a\n[09:13] question. I've noticed that I've got\n[09:14] into the habit of not advocating for my\n[09:16] needs when I should do. I don't hold my\n[09:18] boundaries sufficiently well. Like, this\n[09:19] is why the reflection part's really\n[09:21] important. So,\n[09:24] what would I do to make 85-year-old me\n[09:25] as miserable as possible? How would I\n[09:27] spend my day? And in what ways am I\n[09:30] already doing that? Well,\n[09:33] a lot of those are going to cross over.\n[09:34] That ven diagram is not going to be as\n[09:36] far apart as you might think it is. I've\n[09:38] heard you ask the question before about\n[09:40] if someone was watching this and it was\n[09:41] a movie. What was that?\n[09:42] >> Yes. I mean I mean it's the this\n[09:44] question is so fantastic.\n[09:48] If your life was a movie and the\n[09:50] audience were watching up to this point,\n[09:53] what would they be screaming at the\n[09:55] screen telling you to do with your life?\n[09:57] They would be it is obvious. Leave the\n[10:00] relationship. The job is not working for\n[10:02] you. The killer's hiding in the\n[10:04] cupboard.\n[10:06] What would the audience be screaming at\n[10:08] the screen telling you to do with your\n[10:09] life?\n[10:10] >> So, you've asked three questions and I'm\n[10:13] going to ask you those three questions.\n[10:14] >> Okay.\n[10:15] >> So, the first question you asked was\n[10:16] about what would have to happen at the\n[10:19] end of next year to look back and\n[10:21] consider this year a success. So, for\n[10:23] you personally, I want to spend more\n[10:26] time thinking about ideas and less time\n[10:28] caught up of doing admin.\n[10:29] >> Uh admin is a drain on me. I don't enjoy\n[10:32] I don't enjoy emails. I don't enjoy the\n[10:34] operations of that sort of stuff.\n[10:36] >> Spend time making or\n[10:37] >> Yeah, I want to be in maker mode, not\n[10:38] manager mode,\n[10:39] >> would be a way to put it. Uh, I want to\n[10:42] spend more time with my friends. I've\n[10:44] been soloreneur grind set, you know,\n[10:47] pick it up and lift it type thing a lot\n[10:49] for the last forever. More time with my\n[10:52] friends, more time connecting with\n[10:53] people. So,\n[10:56] that's two things. Like, if I can do\n[10:57] that, spend more time with my friends\n[10:58] and less time doing admin. Now, one of\n[11:00] the problems that you have is and I want\n[11:02] to lose 20 pounds and I want to get my\n[11:04] bench press up to 200 kilos and I want\n[11:05] to do this and it's like really like do\n[11:07] you really really really want that?\n[11:08] Because when I think about it, I have\n[11:10] like much more gentle goals have much\n[11:13] broader goals and that's the stuff that\n[11:16] I think is important to me.\n[11:17] >> And if we think about your subtraction\n[11:19] framework, what what are you going to\n[11:20] have to subtract?\n[11:21] >> Well, what's interesting about those is\n[11:23] that actually those aren't necessarily\n[11:25] additions. The friends thing is an\n[11:26] addition, but the executive functioning\n[11:29] thing, the admin burden is not. So,\n[11:31] actually, that's nice because I want to\n[11:32] do less of that thing, which should\n[11:33] hopefully open up a little bit of time.\n[11:35] What would I need to get rid of? I'd\n[11:37] realistically need to get rid of some\n[11:39] time sat in front of my computer doing\n[11:42] boring admin stuff. I'd probably need to\n[11:45] spend less time scrolling on my phone,\n[11:47] less time on social media. I would maybe\n[11:50] need to make some sacrifices in training\n[11:52] as well. If I'm going to go out with my\n[11:53] friends a little bit more in an evening,\n[11:55] I'm gonna have to get up a bit later.\n[11:56] So, there's some of the trades that\n[11:57] we're gonna have to make.\n[11:58] >> The other question was around if this\n[12:01] was a movie and the audience was\n[12:02] screaming at you.\n[12:03] >> Mhm.\n[12:03] >> What would they be screaming?\n[12:05] >> You're already doing enough.\n[12:08] You're already doing enough. Stop\n[12:11] whipping yourself into submission,\n[12:13] thinking that your happiness sits on the\n[12:16] other side of the next set of goals that\n[12:17] you're going to achieve. You've already\n[12:19] achieved goals that you said would make\n[12:21] you happy.\n[12:22] So if you haven't made it now, if this\n[12:25] isn't when life is going to begin, then\n[12:28] when when when are you going to start?\n[12:30] There's this uh wonderful idea of the\n[12:33] the deferred life hypothesis. Deferred\n[12:36] life hypothesis is basically the sort of\n[12:37] common belief that our life hasn't yet\n[12:40] begun. That what's happening now is a\n[12:43] sort of prelude. It's an intro to our\n[12:47] life truly beginning. And upon\n[12:50] reflection, what a lot of people realize\n[12:52] is that this prelude that they run\n[12:54] through was a mirage that sort of faded\n[12:58] as they approached and they were\n[12:59] actually just running toward the end of\n[13:00] their life. Like they're permanently\n[13:02] putting things off. I get it. People\n[13:04] have got realistic structural monetary\n[13:08] requirements. They've got to get up.\n[13:10] They've got to go to work. They've got\n[13:11] to [ __ ] change their nappy. They've\n[13:13] got to walk their dog. They've got\n[13:14] things that they need to do. That's not\n[13:15] what I'm talking about. My point is\n[13:18] everybody thinks a lot of people think\n[13:21] in one form or another that my life will\n[13:24] begin when they're holding their\n[13:26] happiness hostage. They're in a holding\n[13:27] pattern like a plane that can't land for\n[13:29] some reason. It's like what if that what\n[13:32] if that never changes? What if your\n[13:35] problems in life are never ever going to\n[13:36] go away? What if problems are always\n[13:38] going to be there? What then? Oh wow.\n[13:41] Well, I'm never going to arrive. That\n[13:44] means I need to start living now. And I\n[13:46] think for me there's definitely a lot of\n[13:47] um I will get there when once the tasks\n[13:51] of today are completed once the problems\n[13:53] are gotten through. There'll never be a\n[13:55] time when there's no problems in life.\n[13:56] Problems are a feature, not a bug.\n[13:58] >> I sometimes wonder if this is a trait of\n[14:01] just human evolution. Like it makes\n[14:03] survival sense for it to be hardwired\n[14:06] into my genetic code to strive to\n[14:09] basically continue to strive like to\n[14:10] continue to conquer to continue to\n[14:12] build. And in fact, maybe if my\n[14:13] ancestors didn't have that, we wouldn't\n[14:14] be sat in a room now with all these\n[14:16] lights and fancy cameras and such\n[14:18] because this is the consequence of a\n[14:20] species that strive. And so I wonder if\n[14:23] this is like the curse of being human,\n[14:24] which is we just endlessly strive and\n[14:25] then we die. And because we did our our\n[14:27] offspring have a higher rate of\n[14:29] survival. And like when I speak to\n[14:31] people from, you know, like East Asian\n[14:33] traditions and stuff, they talk about\n[14:35] being at peace and being at one and\n[14:36] being satisfied and all these things,\n[14:38] but it seems so alien to me to be\n[14:41] satisfied.\n[14:42] >> I I I I think I live in a dichotomy\n[14:45] where I'm like well aware nothing will\n[14:46] change my happiness and then at the same\n[14:48] time I'm completely striving as if it\n[14:50] would. Of course, that's a human\n[14:52] condition. We habituate in both\n[14:54] directions. So if your ancestors had\n[14:58] been satisfied when they got to a cave,\n[15:01] when their family grew and they needed a\n[15:03] bigger cave, when you don't just go and\n[15:06] find one bush, you find a ton of bushes\n[15:07] and then you expand and that gives you\n[15:09] additional security.\n[15:11] >> But unfortunately in the modern world,\n[15:13] that causes us with an infinite amount\n[15:15] of things that we can do and can chase\n[15:17] after. We sacrifice the important for\n[15:19] the urgent. The urgent's always in front\n[15:22] of us. the email, the next meeting.\n[15:25] >> Yeah.\n[15:26] >> And this is again, why should anybody\n[15:29] care about doing an annual review?\n[15:31] Should anybody care about the new year?\n[15:33] Well, you're busy living your life for\n[15:35] almost the entirety of the year. And\n[15:37] this is one moment where the urgent can\n[15:40] just take a tiny bit of a backseat and\n[15:42] the important can come through. Who have\n[15:45] I been over the last year? What do I\n[15:46] want from next year? Every single year\n[15:48] is a chapter of your life.\n[15:51] for next year. It's chapter 38 for me.\n[15:53] What do I want that chapter to be about?\n[15:56] >> Do you think there's a single a single\n[15:58] change you could make to your life that\n[16:00] would yield the greatest return on\n[16:02] happiness? Like if you could go into\n[16:03] your own hardware\n[16:04] >> and rewrite the code a little bit.\n[16:07] >> I think less striving would actually\n[16:08] make me happier. I think that a lot of\n[16:10] striving and a desire for success comes\n[16:12] from a sense of insufficiency. Like if\n[16:15] only the world recognized my brilliance,\n[16:18] then I will be validated. And it takes a\n[16:21] long time to realize that you don't fix\n[16:23] internal voids with external accolades.\n[16:25] The problem with that is it's an\n[16:26] unteachable lesson. You try and tell\n[16:28] people that money won't fix your\n[16:30] happiness problem or fame won't fix your\n[16:32] self-worth problem. You should see your\n[16:34] parents more. Time in a hammock is never\n[16:36] wasted. You don't love that pretty girl.\n[16:38] She's just hot and difficult to get.\n[16:40] Like all of these things are only\n[16:42] lessons that you can learn once you've\n[16:43] got there. And people who haven't yet\n[16:45] gotten there think, \"Well, that's easy\n[16:47] for you to say.\" And then when they\n[16:49] arrive, for some reason they seem to\n[16:51] evangelize the same insights like\n[16:54] somebody that's just gone through\n[16:55] religious revelation. So either one of\n[16:56] two things is true. People who achieve a\n[16:58] thing are lying about the fact that that\n[17:01] thing didn't fix their problems, their\n[17:03] internal void with external accolades\n[17:06] because of they're part of some cartel\n[17:08] that's trying to pull the ladder up\n[17:09] after they've just gotten in.\n[17:11] >> Or it's the truth, but it's it's an\n[17:16] unteachable lesson. You will not\n[17:18] understand that that thing outside won't\n[17:22] fix your internal void until you get\n[17:23] there. And I I actually think to Naval\n[17:26] quote, it's far easy to achieve our\n[17:28] material desires than to renounce them.\n[17:30] Like if you want a Ferrari, it's much\n[17:32] easier to actually work real hard and\n[17:35] try and like or get some nice car,\n[17:37] whatever it is, so that you learn that\n[17:39] the car isn't the thing that you want\n[17:40] than it is to rid yourself of the desire\n[17:42] for the car overall. And that's not to\n[17:44] say that getting a Ferrari is easy. is\n[17:46] to say that getting rid of the desire is\n[17:47] essentially impossible.\n[17:49] >> I think me and you are probably two guys\n[17:51] that at some deep level had some kind of\n[17:53] internal void. Is that accurate\n[17:56] statement?\n[17:56] >> Of course. Are you speaking in the past\n[17:57] tense?\n[17:58] >> Have.\n[17:59] >> Have. Yeah.\n[18:00] >> Yeah.\n[18:00] >> You've now accomplished so much. You're\n[18:02] like one of the biggest podcasters on\n[18:04] planet earth. You're you're famous.\n[18:05] People know who you are.\n[18:06] >> Biggest in the world talking to second\n[18:07] biggest in the world. Congratulations.\n[18:10] >> But people know who you are. You've got,\n[18:12] you know, money. You've got freedom now.\n[18:14] You can go wherever you want. do\n[18:15] whatever you want. People know who you\n[18:16] are. You get restaurant t reservation\n[18:18] tables.\n[18:19] >> You did it.\n[18:21] >> Is it what you expected? And has has it\n[18:24] actually changed that internal void?\n[18:27] >> The interesting thing is I never\n[18:29] actually thought I was going to amount\n[18:30] to much. I was just I was just really\n[18:34] interested in what was doing what what I\n[18:36] was doing what was in front of me. I\n[18:38] didn't think\n[18:40] this is going to lead to me being some\n[18:43] achieving something or living in America\n[18:45] or whatever. Each different step got me\n[18:47] there. But no, of course not. Of course.\n[18:50] The the the unteachable lesson has\n[18:51] smashed me in the face, which is\n[18:55] fame won't fix your self worth, money\n[18:57] won't make you happy, you should see\n[18:58] your parents more, you can take a day\n[19:00] off. Like all of these lessons, you have\n[19:03] to live them to learn them,\n[19:04] unfortunately. And my last question on\n[19:06] this is when I asked about the change to\n[19:08] your code that you'd make, you talked\n[19:09] about fixing the striving. What's been\n[19:12] the downside of the striving?\n[19:14] >> There's a a common sense of not\n[19:16] enoughness like I will be enough when\n[19:19] right because you can either run away\n[19:20] from something you want or run towards\n[19:21] something uh run yeah run away from\n[19:23] something you fear or run towards\n[19:24] something you want.\n[19:25] >> And what's the consequence of that not\n[19:26] enoughness?\n[19:27] >> It's a sense of lack. It's also a\n[19:30] provisional life. It's putting life off.\n[19:32] I will be\n[19:34] happy, satisfied, peaceful when\n[19:37] >> And is that a thought you have?\n[19:39] >> It's more like an embodied sense. Feel\n[19:41] it. Yeah, I very much feel it. It's this\n[19:43] thriving. It's this pull. It's this sort\n[19:45] of magnetism moving forward.\n[19:47] >> But yeah, dude. Uh if your life was a\n[19:49] movie and the audience were watching up\n[19:50] to this point, what would they be\n[19:51] screaming at the screen telling you to\n[19:53] do? It's usually a very reliable\n[19:57] indicator of where you should be putting\n[19:59] your attention. So, as we think about\n[20:01] next year that the things one should aim\n[20:04] at.\n[20:04] >> Um, what I've heard you I think you said\n[20:06] on the high performance podcast, you\n[20:07] said you're really obsessed with\n[20:08] understanding what success actually is.\n[20:11] >> So, I I also just before we go into the\n[20:13] more practical things,\n[20:14] >> if someone sat at home and I know people\n[20:16] come up to you on your tours and ask you\n[20:17] questions like this a lot, if they're\n[20:18] sat at home trying to figure out what\n[20:20] success actually is for them, is there a\n[20:23] framework or a principle or a method to\n[20:25] figure out what it might mean for them?\n[20:27] I've heard you talk about two ideas\n[20:29] which I love which is the region beta\n[20:30] paradox but also the parable of the\n[20:31] Mexican fisherman which I think both\n[20:33] stayed with me in a profound way. Yeah.\n[20:36] So\n[20:38] three things success region beta uh\n[20:42] Mexican fisherman what success looks\n[20:44] like for any individual person is going\n[20:46] to be different for you knowing that you\n[20:47] really want a family. There's people out\n[20:48] there that like I'm not that fussed. I\n[20:50] don't think that that's on the cards for\n[20:52] me and that's fine. Other people might\n[20:55] really really want to put the workload\n[20:57] down and step off and and go and do the\n[20:59] dad or the mom thing. Unfortunately, you\n[21:02] can't take somebody else's purpose or\n[21:04] success. Like that's that's you can't\n[21:06] wear it as a suit. It's a bad idea,\n[21:09] right? Cuz it's going to not fit. And um\n[21:12] wonderful line, let go or be dragged. If\n[21:16] something doesn't fit, eventually it's\n[21:17] going to hurt wearing it. And that means\n[21:20] if you're not careful with how you\n[21:22] design what it is that you chase after,\n[21:24] you can spend your entire life realizing\n[21:26] that you climbed a huge [ __ ] ladder,\n[21:29] a very, very long ladder that was\n[21:31] leaning up against the wrong wall.\n[21:33] >> And uh you need to ensure that you don't\n[21:34] do that. And this is why we need to just\n[21:35] sit with ourselves, sit with a little\n[21:37] bit of reflection. And that's why this\n[21:38] time in between Christmas and New Year,\n[21:40] I think, is a really wonderful time to\n[21:41] do this. So, how do you work out what it\n[21:44] is that you want to do? the big picture\n[21:46] goals are going to be hard for you to to\n[21:49] get to. But if you just think one year\n[21:51] ahead, what do I want over the next 12\n[21:53] months? I think that usually helps you.\n[21:54] And maybe you want to be in a\n[21:55] relationship. I want to be in a\n[21:56] committed relationship with someone who\n[21:57] really loves me. Okay, now we can start\n[22:00] to talk about a plan to do that. But you\n[22:03] need to have a little bit of silence.\n[22:04] It's like a problem with permanently\n[22:07] being busy stops you from being able to\n[22:09] listen to fleeting thoughts that are in\n[22:11] the back of your mind. Mhm.\n[22:12] >> And that quiet voice is usually the\n[22:14] really powerful one. But\n[22:17] the there's a wonderful line, the\n[22:19] answers you seek are in the silence\n[22:21] you're avoiding.\n[22:24] The answers that you seek are in the\n[22:25] silence you're avoiding.\n[22:26] >> Do you meditate?\n[22:27] >> Of course you do.\n[22:28] >> Yes.\n[22:29] >> No.\n[22:29] >> Yeah. Do you?\n[22:31] >> No.\n[22:31] >> Do you wish you did?\n[22:33] >> I think the the definition of meditation\n[22:36] is quite blurry because for me when I'm\n[22:38] I I will have a shower for like 30\n[22:39] minutes and all I'm doing in there is\n[22:41] thinking. I'm not cleaning.\n[22:44] Like I'm clean after five minutes.\n[22:45] >> I was gonna say it suggests that you\n[22:47] come out of the shower not clean but\n[22:49] with great ideas.\n[22:50] >> Exactly.\n[22:50] >> No, but I I I mean you get clean in like\n[22:52] 5 minutes, but then I spend the other 25\n[22:54] minutes because there's something about\n[22:55] the waterfalling and the alone time that\n[22:58] drops me into a a spiral of thinking\n[23:00] which I think is my version of\n[23:01] meditation. Then treadmills and the\n[23:03] stepper at the gym.\n[23:04] >> Treadmills are great.\n[23:05] >> Yeah.\n[23:05] >> My version of meditation.\n[23:06] >> Shower thoughts are overrated. Toilet\n[23:08] thoughts are underrated. The other thing\n[23:10] that I I love that you talk about is\n[23:11] what it when we talk about metrics of\n[23:13] success, you talk about observable\n[23:14] metrics and hidden metrics\n[23:16] >> of success.\n[23:17] >> Yeah. So, a lot of the time we'll trade\n[23:20] a hidden metric for an observable\n[23:22] metric. Something that's observable\n[23:23] would be your job title, what your\n[23:26] salary is per year, how many people know\n[23:27] you, your bank balance, the size of your\n[23:29] house, the car that you drive,\n[23:31] >> things people can see.\n[23:32] >> Yeah, of course. The only way that your\n[23:34] success can be judged is outwardly. So\n[23:37] naturally we trade something which\n[23:39] people can't see for something that they\n[23:41] can see. For instance, lots of people\n[23:43] would trade a longer commute for a\n[23:46] higher salary or um\n[23:50] a better job title. One of the problems\n[23:52] that you encounter with that is that the\n[23:54] length of your commute is one of the\n[23:56] most correlated uh stats with your\n[23:58] happiness. Longer commutes reliably make\n[24:00] people more miserable. And what's the\n[24:02] hidden metric that you've lost by doing\n[24:04] that? Well, that's less time with your\n[24:08] family, with maybe your kids that are\n[24:09] growing up, with your wife to connect,\n[24:11] that's less time to pursue your own\n[24:13] passions, even if your job is your\n[24:15] passion. So, what about uh a more\n[24:18] stressful career? Going to move into a\n[24:20] different industry that's way more\n[24:21] stressful, but it pays more observable\n[24:24] metric. What's the hidden metric? What\n[24:25] about the peace of mind that you have as\n[24:27] you go to sleep at night? What about\n[24:29] what that does to your health and the\n[24:31] quality of your relationships and your\n[24:32] ability to be present on a weekend?\n[24:34] because you're not able to turn your\n[24:35] phone off because your last job was 9\n[24:37] to5, but this one is 247.\n[24:40] Well, it's difficult to say because\n[24:42] you're like, people want and need real\n[24:46] resources. I want to improve the quality\n[24:47] of my family. That's a noble thing to\n[24:48] do. But after a while, you have to admit\n[24:52] if you already live a comfortable\n[24:54] quality of life and you trade it,\n[24:57] you you trade your happiness or your\n[24:59] your peace in order to get more,\n[25:02] you're making a bad choice because\n[25:04] you're going to sacrifice something that\n[25:06] you want, which is happiness, peace,\n[25:07] connection for something that's supposed\n[25:09] to get the thing that you want, which is\n[25:11] money, job title, bigger car,\n[25:14] >> which I think links to the story of the\n[25:16] Mexican fisher.\n[25:17] >> Yeah. Parable of the Mexican fisherman.\n[25:19] Uh,\n[25:21] an American businessman was away on a\n[25:23] holiday in Mexico and he got taken out\n[25:25] by a fisherman and he asked the\n[25:27] fisherman, \"So, what do you do each\n[25:28] day?\" The fisherman said, \"I spend each\n[25:31] morning out on the water. I fish a\n[25:33] little. I catch some food. I take it\n[25:35] home and I sit in my house with my wife\n[25:38] and my family and we eat what I've\n[25:39] caught for the day.\" The American says,\n[25:41] \"That's stupid. This a stupid idea. what\n[25:43] you should do is you should get a bigger\n[25:45] boat and then you could catch more fish\n[25:46] and then you could go sell it at the\n[25:47] market. The fisherman said, \"Why would I\n[25:50] do that?\" So, well, once you've sold it\n[25:51] at the market, you could buy some more\n[25:53] boats and you could get your friends to\n[25:54] come and work for you and then they\n[25:55] could catch more fish and you could\n[25:57] start to sell it wholesale. Fisherman\n[25:59] said, \"Why would I do that?\" So, well\n[26:01] then you could create a canning factory\n[26:03] and you could export it back to the UK\n[26:05] and you could have a huge business.\n[26:07] Fisherman said, \"Why would I do that?\"\n[26:10] So well then you would be able to retire\n[26:12] and fish a little on a morning, catch\n[26:13] some fish, and then spend the afternoon\n[26:14] with your family.\n[26:17] And it's the same lesson as Paulo Qua's\n[26:19] The Alchemist, which is this young boy\n[26:22] goes on a huge big journey and he finds\n[26:25] out the thing that he was looking for\n[26:26] was in the back garden all along. But\n[26:29] that's an unteachable lesson. And the\n[26:31] big lesson behind The Alchemist is\n[26:34] going on a massive journey to end up\n[26:36] back where you started is not the same\n[26:38] as having never left.\n[26:40] And this is what an unteachable lesson\n[26:42] is. You have to go to the top of the\n[26:44] mountain to get up there and go, \"Damn\n[26:46] it.\n[26:47] Damn it.\" Like, I thought that was going\n[26:49] to be the answer. But now that it's not,\n[26:51] I can rid myself of that. I've crossed\n[26:53] it off. And it's so unpopular. It's so\n[26:55] unpopular to talk about this online\n[26:57] because everybody that doesn't have a\n[26:58] thing assumes that the thing will fix\n[27:00] their problems and that the people who\n[27:01] have got there, achieved it, and say\n[27:03] that it didn't are ungrateful.\n[27:06] like, \"Oh my god, the thing that I want\n[27:08] and they're just casting it away.\" Like,\n[27:10] how dare you? How dare you say that the\n[27:12] thing that I know I want isn't the\n[27:14] answer to my problems.\n[27:17] And yet, reliably,\n[27:19] everybody that gets there says it's not\n[27:22] the answer.\n[27:24] It's very true. I was thinking back to\n[27:26] all the goals that I wrote in my diary\n[27:28] at 18 years old, and then it's no\n[27:30] surprise that that I have none of those\n[27:32] things now. They're all like material\n[27:33] things and outcomes I was looking for.\n[27:35] Let me give you another one. A great\n[27:36] question to reflect on. Knowing what I\n[27:39] know now,\n[27:41] what advice would I give myself 12\n[27:43] months ago?\n[27:45] Do you know what mine would be? Mine\n[27:46] would be around it would be about around\n[27:48] prioritization.\n[27:50] It would really be around the saying no.\n[27:52] Like we we don't really teach it goes\n[27:54] back to what you're saying about adding\n[27:55] and subtracting, but my life would be\n[27:57] much better if I was\n[28:00] even 10% better at saying no to things.\n[28:02] >> Mhm.\n[28:03] >> It would be so much better. I'd be so\n[28:04] much more s upside isn't like 10%\n[28:06] upside. It's like 50 100% upside because\n[28:09] the compounding force of focus.\n[28:10] >> Okay. So that's what advice you would\n[28:13] have given yourself 12 months ago\n[28:14] knowing what you know now.\n[28:15] >> Yeah.\n[28:16] >> Guess what?\n[28:16] >> Well, it's almost certainly what you\n[28:18] need to hear right now.\n[28:20] >> The big problems are the big problems.\n[28:22] In the same way that you've got the feat\n[28:24] that you had a decade ago, the big\n[28:26] drivers psychologically for you tend to\n[28:29] be the same throughout your life. Uh, I\n[28:32] put other people's happiness ahead of\n[28:34] mine. Maybe that showed up when I was a\n[28:36] child and I didn't speak up to mom when\n[28:37] I felt upset because I was worried that\n[28:39] it would upset her. Maybe that happened\n[28:41] when I got into my first job and I\n[28:42] didn't advocate for myself when my boss\n[28:44] was treating me poorly. Maybe that\n[28:46] happens when I get into a relationship\n[28:48] and I'm scared of making my needs known\n[28:50] to my partner because I'm worried that\n[28:52] they're going to reject me or think\n[28:54] lesser of me. When it comes to my child,\n[28:56] I'm terrified to discipline them because\n[28:57] I need their love and I don't want them\n[28:59] to make them upset. This is a single\n[29:01] trend that's occurring throughout your\n[29:03] life and all of the time. One of the\n[29:05] most common questions that people ask is\n[29:07] what would you tell yourself 10 years\n[29:08] ago? Great question to ask. Not because\n[29:10] it's trit, but because it is almost\n[29:12] always the very same thing that you need\n[29:14] to hear right now.\n[29:16] >> What would you have said it 12 months\n[29:18] ago?\n[29:22] >> Stop working so hard.\n[29:24] >> Stop working. Take a day off. Take a day\n[29:27] off. Take a day off per week. Put your\n[29:28] phone down. Put your phone down. go\n[29:30] outside, touch some grass, and it's the\n[29:33] same thing now. It's the exact same\n[29:34] thing now.\n[29:35] >> Do you think you're going to accomplish\n[29:36] it?\n[29:38] >> I don't know. I don't know, man. I mean,\n[29:40] you know, I'm trying. I'm trying. But\n[29:44] behavioral design, I I've got better.\n[29:45] The one thing that I can say and the\n[29:47] beautiful thing about the end of your um\n[29:50] review, there are some resolutions\n[29:54] which I decided on a decade ago that I\n[29:58] still do now. And I think that's really\n[30:00] cool. So when I'm faced with the\n[30:02] opportunity to plan because I gave\n[30:04] myself a little bit of space, right? And\n[30:06] it never happened. Very few of the\n[30:07] habits that randomly appeared in the\n[30:09] middle of July are ones that I've stuck\n[30:12] with and I really care about. Bad ones\n[30:13] maybe. I maybe accumulated bad habits in\n[30:15] the middle of July, but most of the ones\n[30:17] that I really love that are very\n[30:19] conscious that are aligned with where I\n[30:21] want to go, they're ones that I\n[30:22] consciously designed, right? They're\n[30:24] ones that were done purposefully and\n[30:25] that's always been around a review\n[30:26] period. So, yeah, end of the year is not\n[30:28] special. When else you going to do it,\n[30:31] right? When else are you going to do it?\n[30:33] But yeah, 12 months ago and and 10 years\n[30:35] ago, I was doing the same thing.\n[30:36] Different industry, running nightclubs,\n[30:38] chill out, take a day off. So, what is\n[30:41] this annual review template that I have\n[30:44] in front of me?\n[30:45] >> At the end of each year, you need to\n[30:46] have some sort of a format. Uh, if\n[30:48] anyone wants to go and download it, they\n[30:49] can go to chriswilx.com/re.\n[30:52] It's totally free. They can just copy\n[30:53] and paste it into their notes app of\n[30:54] choice and then fill it in. I realized\n[30:57] that this big question of it's the end\n[31:00] of the year and I need to look back on\n[31:01] it. I want to uh reflect on what went\n[31:03] well and badly and I want to plan my\n[31:05] goals. without a a structure, you're\n[31:10] just like cast out a drift, freewheeling\n[31:12] everywhere, and you have no idea what to\n[31:13] do. So, there's a bunch of questions.\n[31:16] Stuff like, \"How has this year gone?\n[31:18] What went well? What went badly? And\n[31:20] why? What lessons did I learn? What\n[31:23] habit or system accounted for most of my\n[31:25] success? What are the most valuable ways\n[31:27] that I spend my time? How can I find\n[31:29] more time for this?\" There's a section\n[31:31] for memories. What was the best\n[31:32] surprise, best meal, coolest new\n[31:34] experience, my favorite new city, my\n[31:36] favorite new friend? What was my\n[31:38] favorite day or my most intense day? Was\n[31:40] the best sex I had? What's my favorite\n[31:42] quote and song and artist? And then\n[31:45] there's a plan. What would I do this\n[31:47] year if I wanted to make 85-year-old me\n[31:48] miserable? What are the things I do to\n[31:51] make my day go great?\n[31:53] What do I think is productive that\n[31:55] isn't?\n[31:57] What is productive that I don't realize?\n[31:59] Those are two big ones.\n[32:00] >> Mhm.\n[32:01] And then there's some final thoughts.\n[32:03] What would have to have happened by the\n[32:04] end of next year to look back and\n[32:05] consider it a success? Who do I need to\n[32:07] become for the next chapter of my life\n[32:09] to go the way that I want? Knowing what\n[32:10] I know now, what advice would I give\n[32:12] myself 12 months ago? So for the people\n[32:13] that are frantically taking notes, they\n[32:14] can just go to chriswallex.com/re. And\n[32:16] this is this is available for free.\n[32:18] >> You mentioned there that goals you set\n[32:19] 10 years ago are still some of your most\n[32:21] important today.\n[32:22] >> Mhm.\n[32:23] >> What are those goals that you cherish\n[32:25] the most? Habits, goals that you cherish\n[32:27] the most that you you set out to\n[32:28] accomplish 10 years ago. So, I reflected\n[32:30] last year on the highest ROI resolutions\n[32:33] that I've ever done. And what I think\n[32:35] would be cool would be if people put the\n[32:37] single best return on investment res re\n[32:41] resolution that they've ever done in the\n[32:43] comments cuz that will create maybe the\n[32:46] biggest repository of the highest value\n[32:49] New Year's resolutions that anybody's\n[32:51] ever had and the best ones will get\n[32:52] updated and the bad ones will be heavily\n[32:54] criticized in the replies. So, that\n[32:55] could be kind of cool. Okay, so that was\n[32:57] an instruction which means if you're\n[32:59] listening right now, leave a comment\n[33:00] below with the resolution you set\n[33:02] yourself at any point in the past that\n[33:04] returned the most for you in any in any\n[33:06] area of your life.\n[33:07] >> You love it the most.\n[33:08] >> And if you agree with someone's, please\n[33:10] hit the like button on their comment,\n[33:12] too. And this should create, as Chris\n[33:14] says, a repository of the most\n[33:15] impactful, highest ROI resolutions.\n[33:18] >> I think that's cool, dude. I want to do\n[33:19] it. I want to know what everyone else's\n[33:20] big resolutions are. So, I'll I'll give\n[33:22] you mine. Okay. No phone in the bedroom\n[33:24] at night. charge it outside.\n[33:26] >> Interesting.\n[33:27] >> It's an instant 15% quality of life\n[33:31] increase.\n[33:32] >> Why?\n[33:32] >> Because when you start your day, if you\n[33:34] use your phone as your alarm, you roll\n[33:36] over, you turn the alarm off, and\n[33:39] immediately you're looking at your\n[33:40] phone. You haven't got up, you haven't\n[33:42] got moving, you're not hydrated, you're\n[33:43] not seeing sunlight in your eyes, you\n[33:45] are\n[33:47] hit in the face by the world telling you\n[33:49] what's happening as opposed to you\n[33:50] having a tiny little microcosm of peace,\n[33:53] this little oasis for you. Now, I get\n[33:54] it. People that have got young kids are\n[33:56] hit in the face by the children, not by\n[33:57] the phone. But even if you do, adding\n[34:00] the phone and the scroll and everything\n[34:02] else on top, that means you're not\n[34:03] present with the kids. So, even if the\n[34:04] kids are a problem, you don't need to\n[34:05] have the phone in there. You wake up, it\n[34:08] means that you're always on the other\n[34:10] side. The world is happening to you.\n[34:12] You're not happening to the world. When\n[34:14] you go to bed on a nighttime, you're\n[34:16] going to be using your phone before you\n[34:17] go to sleep, which means that you're\n[34:19] going to cut into your sleep time.\n[34:21] you're going to be uh in an environment\n[34:24] digitally that's going to make yourself\n[34:26] feel horrendous. It's not good. It's not\n[34:28] good for sleep. Whether it's the blue\n[34:30] light, there's a little bit of research\n[34:31] that seems to say that it's not the blue\n[34:32] light so much as it is the scroll sort\n[34:36] of dopamine trigger adrenal intermittent\n[34:39] schedule reward thing that that's the\n[34:40] the main issue of what's going on. But\n[34:43] it also means if you can't sleep, you\n[34:45] know, you can just roll over and pick\n[34:46] your phone up and now you're two hours\n[34:47] into a YouTube scroll hole. That's who\n[34:49] you truly are. By the way, people think\n[34:51] that who you are is, you know, your\n[34:52] journal entries, your diary entries. No,\n[34:54] no. Who you truly are are the videos\n[34:56] that you watch on YouTube between 10\n[34:58] p.m. and 12:00 p.m. at night when you\n[34:59] can't sleep. That's who you really are.\n[35:01] So, getting your phone and putting it\n[35:03] outside of the bedroom is no cost.\n[35:06] There's no reason to not do it. The only\n[35:08] reason to not do it is somebody needs to\n[35:09] ring you or something like that. I get\n[35:12] it. Maybe you've got kids that are out\n[35:14] late and you need to make sure that\n[35:16] they're okay in case some sort of\n[35:17] catastrophe occurs. Really, there are\n[35:18] very few excuses to not have it outside.\n[35:20] Radio alarm clocks have existed for\n[35:21] forever. Buy a radio alarm clock. Take\n[35:24] your phone cable now and put it in the\n[35:26] kitchen or put it in the living room or\n[35:28] something or put it on the other side of\n[35:29] the room, right? Cuz you don't want to\n[35:31] wake up and charge on your phone. The\n[35:33] it's the single biggest improves quality\n[35:36] of sleep. It means that your mornings\n[35:37] are better. It means that your nights\n[35:38] are better. It means you're less\n[35:39] distracted. It means you spend less time\n[35:40] on your phone. you're forced to do\n[35:41] something even tiny bit more productive\n[35:44] like watch Netflix or read a book or\n[35:46] talk to your partner. It's interesting\n[35:48] because I was thinking about this\n[35:50] through a four quadrant graph\n[35:51] >> drawing a diagram\n[35:52] >> where I'll throw it up on the screen\n[35:54] please and make it look better editing\n[35:55] team because this nobody's going to be\n[35:56] able this is not coherent but on one\n[35:58] axis you've got things that are low\n[35:59] effort and on the other axis you've got\n[36:01] things that are high return and this is\n[36:03] right up in the top right which is like\n[36:04] very low effort high return habit yeah\n[36:08] which is probably where one should aim\n[36:09] most but I imagine a lot of us are\n[36:11] aiming at like high effort low return\n[36:12] >> uh morning walk every day\n[36:14] >> okay morning walk slightly higher effort\n[36:16] >> uh The research around this is is\n[36:18] fantastic. Humans obviously pushed this\n[36:20] a lot. Morning sunlight in your eyes,\n[36:21] even if you don't have the sun. Even if\n[36:23] you're somewhere dark and cold and wet,\n[36:25] doesn't matter. Getting up and doing uh\n[36:27] ambulation, so walking through an\n[36:29] environment while your eyes scan left\n[36:30] and right seems to tune down your fear\n[36:33] response. It makes uh your amygdala just\n[36:36] a little bit more calm. So regardless of\n[36:38] whether if there's sunlight, fantastic,\n[36:39] that'll be even better. 5 minutes, 10\n[36:41] minutes. And I know people have got\n[36:42] structural limitations. This is me\n[36:44] assuming that you've got like 20 minutes\n[36:46] on a morning that you could slot this\n[36:48] into. And if you're not waking up with\n[36:50] your phone in your hand, that probably\n[36:51] is the 20 minutes, right? Little walk,\n[36:54] bit of fresh air, just get up, put your\n[36:56] shoes on, get going, just get moving.\n[36:58] You don't need to think. You don't need\n[36:58] to do anything at all. Don't need to\n[37:00] brush your teeth. Get up and go.\n[37:01] Probably need to get to the bathroom,\n[37:02] actually. Get up and go. Uh, no caffeine\n[37:04] within 90 minutes of waking. Just push\n[37:07] your caffeine a little bit later. It\n[37:09] seems like the adenosine system isn't\n[37:12] dominant during the first 90 minutes of\n[37:14] the day. Your adrenal system is.\n[37:15] >> So adenosine is the the receptors that\n[37:17] deal with caffeine and tightness.\n[37:19] >> And tightness. Exactly. And caffeine\n[37:20] binds to it and it stops you from\n[37:22] feeling tired. Salt act on your adrenal\n[37:24] system. So if you use some sort of\n[37:25] electrolyte drink first thing in the\n[37:27] morning, that will help to get that\n[37:28] moving. But the main reason for this,\n[37:30] regardless of the research, most people\n[37:32] have a 100 pm slump, feel a little bit\n[37:34] tired. And I think if you just push that\n[37:37] caffeine a little bit later, just see if\n[37:39] you can hold on. When you wake up, you\n[37:40] should be okayish, just the natural\n[37:43] cortisol, you've gone for a little walk,\n[37:45] you know, you're here we are, the day\n[37:47] has begun. Do you really need a c a\n[37:49] coffee within 20 minutes of waking?\n[37:51] That's what most people's first thing\n[37:52] is. Just see what happens. Test it. See\n[37:54] what happens if you push it back by 90\n[37:55] minutes and see how you feel. At least\n[37:56] for me, I know that that works well.\n[37:59] No alcohol for 6 months. This is a big\n[38:02] one. This is much more high effort for a\n[38:04] lot of people, even people that don't\n[38:06] drink that much. Uh because a lot of the\n[38:09] parties and things that you attend, are\n[38:12] not superbly fun. And some people use\n[38:16] alcohol in order to make their family or\n[38:20] the wedding or the birthday a little bit\n[38:23] more comfortable.\n[38:24] >> A social lubricant.\n[38:25] >> Correct. Yeah, of course. But if you\n[38:28] take alcohol out for about six months,\n[38:30] what it forces you to do is think, do I\n[38:33] really want to go to that party? I'm\n[38:35] actually having to anesthetize myself of\n[38:38] the people that I'm around. Like, if you\n[38:41] can only bear to be around your friends\n[38:42] when you're drinking, that's probably\n[38:44] not a good indication. And if your\n[38:47] friends only want you to be around them\n[38:49] when you're drinking, they're not\n[38:51] friends, they're drinking partners.\n[38:54] So, I think alcohol is a a big qu I just\n[38:57] like it. It just makes me have more fun.\n[38:59] All Hey, I get it. But I think if people\n[39:02] look at it closely, they realize that\n[39:03] they're using alcohol as a bit of a\n[39:06] crutch. They're using it to bolster\n[39:09] themselves in a way. What's interesting\n[39:12] is it's one of those areas where you\n[39:14] don't understand the hidden cost until\n[39:16] you really give it up for a while. And\n[39:19] and I think about my own relationship\n[39:20] with drinking and I stopped drinking at\n[39:22] 30 years old. I'm now 33. And I had just\n[39:26] drank because I just drank. I'd never\n[39:28] ran the experiment of just giving it up\n[39:29] for a while. And I and then at like I\n[39:31] don't know maybe I was at 31. I thought,\n[39:33] you know, I'll have a drink again\n[39:35] >> because now I could really AB test it.\n[39:36] I'd had a year of not drinking. Decided\n[39:38] to have a drink again.\n[39:40] >> It ruined three days of my life. I had a\n[39:43] couple of glasses of wine, didn't get\n[39:45] drunk. It ruined three days of my life\n[39:47] because of the the domino effect it\n[39:48] caused. So it meant that I got worse\n[39:50] sleep that night and then because I got\n[39:52] worse sleep that night. I ate more\n[39:53] poorly the the next day because my my\n[39:55] dopamine system or whatever the cortisol\n[39:57] system was all messed up\n[39:58] >> and then I I podcasted worse. I didn't\n[40:01] go to the gym the the day after that\n[40:03] that day or the day after because of\n[40:04] that because I felt really bad. I then\n[40:07] slept worse and I could track all of\n[40:08] this on my weight. Hashtag ad\n[40:09] hashtagsponsor hashtag investor\n[40:10] whatever.\n[40:10] >> Bye.\n[40:11] >> Yeah. And I was like, \"Oh my god, those\n[40:13] three glasses of wine had this hidden\n[40:15] domino effect that I must have been\n[40:17] living with for my whole life.\"\n[40:19] >> Dude, so many people want to build\n[40:22] habits. They want to build meditation\n[40:23] routine. They want to go to the gym more\n[40:26] consistently. They want to improve their\n[40:27] eating habits. They don't realize that\n[40:29] the thing that's stopping them from\n[40:31] doing that is sat at the bottom of the\n[40:32] glass of wine that they have four nights\n[40:34] a week. It's tough. Some people are able\n[40:37] to do it and they don't mind. The\n[40:38] costbenefit ratio for some people is\n[40:41] great. I'm just saying try just try try\n[40:45] six months. The reason that you need to\n[40:46] put an end date on it is that you have\n[40:49] it's like running a race where you know\n[40:50] that there's a finish line. If there's\n[40:52] no finish line, it's really hard to run\n[40:53] the race. How are you motivating\n[40:54] yourself to get there? I think that 90\n[40:56] days would be the absolute minimum. 30\n[40:58] days isn't long enough. You need longer,\n[41:00] right? And especially given that the\n[41:01] hardest bit is the start, which means\n[41:04] that you've paid all of the pain at the\n[41:05] very beginning to not actually get any\n[41:07] of the benefits of this being my new\n[41:08] habit.\n[41:09] >> Do it with an accountability buddy. Do\n[41:10] it with your partner. Say, \"Hey, I\n[41:13] listened to those two British idiots\n[41:14] talk about how not drinking might be a\n[41:16] good idea.\" Why don't we do that? Why\n[41:18] don't we try going sober until July? You\n[41:20] haven't missed the summer, right? The\n[41:21] summer's just about to kick in. So, if\n[41:23] you think, \"Oh, I can't wait to get back\n[41:24] to drinking.\" You can have a a beer in a\n[41:25] beer garden.\n[41:28] a huge proportion of people will not\n[41:30] want to go back to drinking. They'll do\n[41:32] it, take time off, get into it, and\n[41:35] realize\n[41:36] I actually don't like this. I love the\n[41:38] fact I got more\n[41:42] reward from building good habits, from\n[41:45] now having a meditation practice, from\n[41:47] now getting up on time, from being able\n[41:49] to go to the gym more. I've become more\n[41:51] dependent on that than I ever was on the\n[41:53] alcohol. This is an idea you when we\n[41:56] talk about habits and when we read these\n[41:57] habit books, we we're often aiming at\n[41:59] like the ninth domino in a set of\n[42:02] dominoes.\n[42:02] >> And I was just thinking then like the\n[42:04] conversation probably needs to start\n[42:06] with what are like the foundational\n[42:07] things. What is the first domino?\n[42:10] Because we know from science that what I\n[42:12] choose to eat is heavily impacted by my\n[42:14] hormone balance today and my hormone\n[42:16] balance is impacted by my sleep, my\n[42:17] emotional regulation, all these things.\n[42:19] A lot of people aim at domino number\n[42:21] nine and think, \"Oh, we'll change that\n[42:22] one.\" Having no idea that actually this\n[42:24] is downstream from a set of other\n[42:26] foundational decisions. And you know,\n[42:29] even as someone that sits here with\n[42:30] scientists and experts all the time, if\n[42:32] my like core state isn't good,\n[42:37] the chance that I'm going to pick the\n[42:38] right thing or go to the gym is\n[42:40] extremely low. Being smart is basically\n[42:43] pointless unless you're at peace.\n[42:46] Like any amount of intelligence can be\n[42:48] overridden by ego or insecurity or\n[42:51] immorality or bad incentives or\n[42:53] impatience or poor sleep.\n[42:56] >> Yeah, sleep is, as far as I can see,\n[42:58] just it's the the pebble at the top of\n[43:02] the avalanche. It's the gateway drug to\n[43:04] everything else being horrendous. Your\n[43:06] caffeine use is impacting your sleep.\n[43:07] Your phone use is impacting your sleep.\n[43:09] Your alcohol in an evening time is\n[43:10] impacting your sleep. If you think that\n[43:11] you drink in order to go to sleep,\n[43:13] you're not sleeping. You're sedating\n[43:15] yourself. Okay. So, if we can sort the\n[43:18] sleep out, how many other things open\n[43:19] up? But you don't sort the sleep out.\n[43:21] You sort the caffeine intake out and you\n[43:23] sort the nighttime phone use out and you\n[43:25] sort the drinking out and then oh my\n[43:28] god, I've got all of this extra\n[43:29] willpower. The thing that I thought was\n[43:31] the issue, which was I kind of always\n[43:32] feel a bit tired and sluggish on the\n[43:34] morning or I always want to eat salty\n[43:35] foods around midday or I always, you\n[43:38] know, always just can't think too\n[43:40] straight for the first couple of hours.\n[43:42] It's like the problem might be hiding at\n[43:44] the bottom of the glass.\n[43:46] >> We think the cause is actually a\n[43:47] symptom. I just noticed this because you\n[43:49] know when I I changed a couple of core\n[43:51] foundational things like exercise and\n[43:52] sleep, everything became everything was\n[43:55] lubricated.\n[43:56] >> What's your highest ROI New Year's\n[43:58] resolutions?\n[44:00] >> Oh, my highest ROI New Year's resolution\n[44:03] was actually a change in a previous\n[44:06] resolution. So my previous resolution in\n[44:08] 2017 was I'm going to go to the gym\n[44:10] every day.\n[44:12] Ended up being a terrible resolution,\n[44:13] >> a horrendous resolution.\n[44:14] >> Yeah. So 2017 it was go to the gym every\n[44:16] day and I got about four or five months\n[44:18] in, I missed a day, the resolution's\n[44:21] done because it was a it was a\n[44:23] completable resolution in an area of my\n[44:25] life where I didn't I need an\n[44:26] incompletable resolution. So 2018, my\n[44:29] resolution became consistency in the\n[44:31] gym.\n[44:31] >> And this is when everything changed\n[44:33] because consistency is a a goal I get a\n[44:37] shot at every day irrespective of what\n[44:39] happened yesterday.\n[44:40] >> And I've got the rule. I've got the\n[44:41] rule. Let me give you the rule.\n[44:42] >> Okay.\n[44:43] >> This is from all of the habit stuff.\n[44:45] James Cle has been on my show. I think\n[44:46] he's been on your show too.\n[44:47] >> Yeah, he has.\n[44:48] >> Yeah. Uh best habit book of all time,\n[44:51] Atomic Habits. Of all of the things,\n[44:54] there's only two that have really,\n[44:55] really, really stuck. This is the best\n[44:57] rule when it comes to habits. Never miss\n[45:00] two days in a row. Like you are not\n[45:03] going to be able to go to the gym every\n[45:05] day. There will be one day when an\n[45:07] absolute catastrophe occurs. You ate\n[45:08] some dodgy sushi last night.\n[45:12] You can't go. But what you have is\n[45:15] one missed day is an error. Two missed\n[45:18] days is the start of a new habit.\n[45:21] And it alleviates this all or nothing\n[45:24] mentality that we all have. If you put a\n[45:26] packet of biscuits in front of me and\n[45:27] you, we say, \"You can have none of them\n[45:30] or you can have all of them.\" Easy. Tell\n[45:33] me to have two of them. [ __ ] you, dude.\n[45:35] I'm not going to have two. No one has\n[45:36] two biscuits, right? You have all of the\n[45:38] biscuits or you have none of the\n[45:39] biscuits. And that's kind of humans are\n[45:41] absolutist creatures. Like think in\n[45:44] extremes.\n[45:44] >> Yeah. Going to be super super dialed in\n[45:47] on my diet and it's going to be great\n[45:48] and I'm going to get up and do my\n[45:49] meditation and do the rest or I'm going\n[45:51] to go full DGEN mode and I'm partying\n[45:53] and it's a beaather and so on and so\n[45:54] forth. Like there is no middle ground\n[45:56] really with this and that means that\n[45:58] small errors can snowball into complete\n[46:02] uh demolitions of the habit. But if you\n[46:06] just think okay at some point this year\n[46:09] I'm going to miss it. And the rule is if\n[46:11] I missed it yesterday I have to do it\n[46:14] today. And that alleviates your issue\n[46:17] which was I cranked it for the first\n[46:19] couple of months and then one day came\n[46:21] in and I thought h and then the second\n[46:23] day and then I thought well this is just\n[46:24] me now.\n[46:25] >> The other trap that I've noticed in that\n[46:27] is one of my friends had great success\n[46:30] with a new habit with going to the gym\n[46:31] for like three or four months. He he\n[46:33] messages us in the group chat. He says I\n[46:34] finally cracked it. I finally figured\n[46:35] out how to do this. And I said to him at\n[46:37] the time, I said, \"Listen, mate. Like\n[46:39] the best the best thought I've ever had\n[46:41] that's made my habits be consistent is\n[46:44] the realization that you never crack\n[46:45] it.\" And actually thinking about the day\n[46:47] when I fall off the horse and what my\n[46:48] strategy is for getting back on the\n[46:49] horse. Like being really really\n[46:51] cognizant of the fact that at some point\n[46:53] I'm going to eat the sushi and it's\n[46:55] going to [ __ ] up my belly or or I'm\n[46:57] going to be on a flight from Australia\n[46:58] and I'm going to land and it's going to\n[46:59] be midnight. And like having a strategy\n[47:02] to get back on the horse and this just\n[47:03] deep belief that you never crack any\n[47:06] habit\n[47:07] >> has been the single most important thing\n[47:08] for me being consistent because when it\n[47:10] happens and I feel unmotivated and that\n[47:12] guilt can creep in and say you [ __ ]\n[47:13] it. I have a I was expecting this.\n[47:16] >> Yes. Of course it's not a a bug it's a\n[47:19] feature.\n[47:19] >> Yeah.\n[47:20] >> This was the price of entry. It's the\n[47:21] cost of doing business of trying to do\n[47:22] behavior change that it's not always\n[47:24] going to work. Mhm.\n[47:26] >> Um, another one, another great uh\n[47:29] resolution, 10-minute walk after every\n[47:31] meal.\n[47:32] >> Interesting.\n[47:33] >> Huge, huge ROI, dude. Crazy. So, it's\n[47:37] called a postprandial walk. Um, and what\n[47:40] it does is it helps to regulate glucose.\n[47:42] It gets your blood sugar moving. Your uh\n[47:45] stomach because of the contrlateral\n[47:47] movement of how your arms and your legs\n[47:48] work, the muscles actually cross across\n[47:50] your stomach, which helps you to digest\n[47:51] food. You know, you have a huge big\n[47:53] meal, you're having a great\n[47:54] conversation, and you sit there and\n[47:55] you're like, \"Uh, I mean, this\n[47:57] conversation's so great, but I feel\n[47:59] awful. This this sucks.\" You just after\n[48:03] you go out for dinner, uh, if you got a\n[48:05] lunch break from work, eat your food,\n[48:07] 10-minute little walk. Again, I\n[48:10] challenge people to do it and not say\n[48:12] that it makes them feel really good. You\n[48:14] go for dinner, you're with a friend,\n[48:16] you're out with a partner, you're\n[48:18] meeting somebody for the first time.\n[48:19] Say, \"Hey, do you want to why don't we\n[48:20] have a little stroll?\" Sometimes it's\n[48:21] gonna be freezing outside, whatever. You\n[48:23] know, do what you can. Let's go for a\n[48:25] little stroll. Makes a huge difference.\n[48:27] Huge difference.\n[48:29] >> What about matters of productivity?\n[48:31] >> Do you think much about this? Because\n[48:32] again, this time of year, people are\n[48:33] thinking about procrastination,\n[48:34] productivity. They're trying to get more\n[48:36] done. They're trying not to doom scroll\n[48:37] so much, be on Netflix, waste time. And\n[48:39] I think a lot of the guilt does come\n[48:40] from feeling like we're unproductive.\n[48:43] >> Absolutely. Yeah. There's a wonderful\n[48:45] idea called productivity dysmorphia. So,\n[48:48] it's the inability to see your own\n[48:49] success.\n[48:50] It's like uh to acknowledge the volume\n[48:52] of your own output. So it sits at the\n[48:54] intersection of burnout, imposttor\n[48:58] syndrome, and anxiety.\n[49:01] It's you think of it like ambitions\n[49:03] alter ego. Basically like the pursuit of\n[49:05] productivity spurs us to do more while\n[49:08] robbing us of the ability to savor any\n[49:10] of the successes that we achieve along\n[49:12] the way. So first off, people are not\n[49:13] particularly good judges of how\n[49:15] productive they are. I think so many\n[49:17] people are whipping themselves into\n[49:18] submission saying you're not doing\n[49:20] enough because in the past that\n[49:21] motivated them to do more.\n[49:23] >> Yeah. And after a while you have to\n[49:26] accept I'm I'm doing quite a lot. And if\n[49:30] you were an athlete on a sports team and\n[49:33] your coach only ever pointed at you when\n[49:36] you made a bad play, you wouldn't feel\n[49:38] particularly motivated by that. But a\n[49:41] lot of people have this sense of\n[49:43] productivity debt. They wake up every\n[49:46] day feeling as if they're already\n[49:48] behind. And only if they dominate their\n[49:50] entire day perfectly can they drag\n[49:52] themselves back up to some minimum level\n[49:54] of acceptable output. And only then can\n[49:57] they go to sleep that night without\n[49:58] feeling like a loser. This means that\n[50:01] you your set point is loss and the best\n[50:04] thing that you can do if you crush the\n[50:06] day is get to a draw. You never win. And\n[50:11] then there's this sort of weird drill\n[50:12] sergeant in the back of your mind that's\n[50:14] saying, \"All right, you can have a\n[50:16] little bit of a break now, but just so\n[50:19] you know, soon as you wake up in the\n[50:20] morning, it's all going to happen\n[50:21] again.\" And you know, I'm speaking to a\n[50:24] very particular type of of mindset here\n[50:26] that there is a huge cohort of people on\n[50:28] the internet who do need David Gogggins\n[50:30] screaming in their face, telling them to\n[50:31] go harder and sort their life out.\n[50:34] The sort of people that listen to your\n[50:35] show and listen to Modern Wisdom are\n[50:39] probably not in that camp.\n[50:41] >> Do you know what's surprising? I am in\n[50:43] that camp. I'm in the camp of\n[50:45] productivity dysmorphia.\n[50:46] >> Mhm. Of course you are. Why is that\n[50:47] surprising? Look at what you've built.\n[50:49] How could you not do that with if you\n[50:51] were seeing how much you did?\n[50:53] >> I can't really think of many days. And\n[50:55] just for context, when I wake up in the\n[50:57] morning till, you know, 2 2 a.m. at\n[50:59] night, I'm working. But I can't think of\n[51:01] many days or really none none come to\n[51:04] mind where I've I've got in bed and\n[51:06] thought you were productive today.\n[51:07] [ __ ]\n[51:07] >> crushed it.\n[51:08] >> You met the standard\n[51:09] >> productivity debt.\n[51:10] >> Yeah.\n[51:10] >> You woke up feeling like you're already\n[51:11] behind\n[51:12] >> 100%. Because of yesterday and the week\n[51:14] before and the month before and the\n[51:15] to-do list.\n[51:15] >> You see you see your own shortfalls from\n[51:18] a front row seat, right? And this is one\n[51:21] of the curses of people who have big\n[51:23] dreams, goals for themselves. the the\n[51:27] size of their goals is always greater\n[51:28] than their ability to deliver them. And\n[51:31] we assume that by having very very very\n[51:33] high standards for ourselves that that's\n[51:36] what what is it? Um shoot for the stars\n[51:37] and even if you don't get it, you'll end\n[51:38] up on the moon. Something like that.\n[51:40] >> Yeah. Whatever. Um that's great for a\n[51:43] while and it's very good at the\n[51:45] beginning of your journey,\n[51:46] >> but after a while I think you just need\n[51:48] to give yourself a [ __ ] break, dude.\n[51:49] Like people are\n[51:52] destroying themselves in this perpetual\n[51:54] sense of not enoughness. They're always\n[51:57] chasing the next thing. So that's all of\n[51:59] that is for me to say that people uh\n[52:01] want productivity, desire productivity.\n[52:03] I'm just trying to say you're probably\n[52:06] working real hard as it is. That being\n[52:07] said, how much do I think about\n[52:08] productivity and how can we like twist\n[52:11] the the knife a little bit more to give\n[52:12] people some some tools?\n[52:15] Best question to ask yourself. Uh, if I\n[52:17] could only achieve one thing today,\n[52:20] start of every day, if I could only\n[52:21] achieve one thing today, what would that\n[52:23] be? You're only allowed to do one thing.\n[52:26] And it's the big thing. It's usually the\n[52:27] scary thing. It's usually the thing that\n[52:28] you probably don't want to do. How many\n[52:30] times does someone go and clean the\n[52:32] cupboard in the kitchen that hasn't been\n[52:34] touched for 6 months? Rearrange. I'll\n[52:36] rearrange all of the plates because they\n[52:38] don't want to have that conversation\n[52:39] with their boss because they don't want\n[52:41] to face that particular piece of work\n[52:43] which is like big and scary and I don't\n[52:44] really know how to tackle it, how to\n[52:45] begin. you will do everything that\n[52:48] doesn't need to be done in order to\n[52:50] avoid the one thing that does. It's\n[52:51] because it's a big scary task that\n[52:53] people will endure months, years,\n[52:56] decades of misery to avoid a couple of\n[52:59] days of pain. And that makes sense. It's\n[53:02] a good trade in some ways, but over time\n[53:04] you're going to accumulate an awful lot\n[53:06] of discomfort.\n[53:08] >> Reminds me of what Nael said when I\n[53:09] interviewed him about procrastination is\n[53:12] the avoidance of discomfort. Um, and he\n[53:14] really said that most of human\n[53:16] motivation is just the avoidance of\n[53:17] discomfort because I I tried to test his\n[53:19] idea. I was like, \"What about having\n[53:20] sex? That's surely the pursuit of\n[53:22] pleasure.\" He was like, \"No, you get\n[53:23] horny, which is a form of discomfort and\n[53:25] in order to alleviate it, you go and\n[53:26] have sex where you pursue.\" But he said,\n[53:28] \"All all of our behavior is driven by\n[53:29] discomfort.\" So, in your example of I've\n[53:31] got a big I've got to start the\n[53:32] manuscript for my new book, but I end up\n[53:34] cleaning the house. It's cuz\n[53:35] >> sounds like a personal example.\n[53:36] >> No, but it is. It's like, you know, I\n[53:38] remember how long I procrastinated on\n[53:39] starting my new book because it's like\n[53:40] being stood at the foot of Mount Everest\n[53:42] starting a book. It's huge.\n[53:44] >> When you think about procrastination,\n[53:46] which is part of pro becoming more\n[53:47] productive,\n[53:48] >> what what in your mind are the causes of\n[53:52] me me avoiding the thing that I should\n[53:54] be doing? As far as I can see, there's\n[53:56] two main reasons for procrastination.\n[53:59] The first one is you don't know what to\n[54:01] do. So, you have this big book in front\n[54:03] of you, but nobody's ever written a\n[54:05] book. they've written a sentence and\n[54:08] then that sentence has accumulated over\n[54:09] time into pages and paragraphs and then\n[54:13] a book appears or you've reviewed a\n[54:15] book, you've looked at the edit, you've\n[54:16] made a decision about the color for the\n[54:18] front cover, but you do what's called a\n[54:22] next action from uh getting things done,\n[54:24] David Allen's productivity strategy.\n[54:26] People want a really really great\n[54:27] productivity strategy. Getting things\n[54:28] done by David Allen is is about as good\n[54:30] as you can get.\n[54:32] You do a next action. So, I'm\n[54:34] procrastinating over a task. What is the\n[54:36] next physical action that I can do that\n[54:40] pushes me toward that goal? I need to\n[54:43] write an email. Well, you better go and\n[54:44] open your email client. Right? If you\n[54:46] don't have your email client open, it is\n[54:48] impossible for you to send the email.\n[54:50] Well, actually, before that, I need to\n[54:51] sit down at my desk. Actually, before\n[54:52] that, I might need to put my pants on.\n[54:55] Okay, pants are on. Hooray. I'm moving.\n[54:58] I'm down at the desk. All right, there\n[54:59] we go. I opened Instagram. [ __ ] Okay,\n[55:02] close Instagram. Email client. That's\n[55:04] the next action. So any bit, what is it\n[55:07] like? Uh completing a marathon is just a\n[55:09] ton of steps one in front of the other.\n[55:11] Like it's just one foot in front of the\n[55:12] other. Do this really really big thing\n[55:13] by breaking it down into small chunks.\n[55:14] That's the first reason in my opinion\n[55:16] for procrastination.\n[55:17] >> Before we move on to the second thing,\n[55:18] it reminds me of something Jordan\n[55:19] Peterson said to me about um why people\n[55:21] don't change their life. He said people\n[55:23] don't change their life because the\n[55:24] first steps to doing so are so embar so\n[55:27] small that it's like embarrassing.\n[55:28] Correct. And he told me the story of a\n[55:30] guy who he was trying to get to change\n[55:32] his life. This person wouldn't leave\n[55:33] their bedroom. Plates stacked to the\n[55:35] ceiling, messy bedroom. And on day one,\n[55:37] he walks in, they put a vacuum cleaner\n[55:38] in there, they do nothing else. Day two,\n[55:40] they come back, they plug it in, nothing\n[55:41] else. Day three, they come back, they\n[55:43] turn it on, nothing else. And by the end\n[55:44] of the 30 days, this guy is out of his\n[55:46] bedroom, his room is clean, and he's out\n[55:47] in out in the world, which he was scared\n[55:49] of. And it always made me think like the\n[55:50] the first step to real change isn't some\n[55:53] great leap which is going to cause huge\n[55:54] cognitive dissonance and discomfort. It\n[55:56] is often so embarrassingly small that we\n[55:58] don't think it's consequential.\n[56:00] >> Yeah.\n[56:00] >> And I think about that with my life all\n[56:01] the time. I'm like actually maybe the\n[56:02] first step here is just like\n[56:06] buying buying a notepad,\n[56:08] >> you know, to start writing my book.\n[56:10] There is definitely a sense that\n[56:14] focusing our attention on a small step\n[56:17] kind of reveals the smallalness of our\n[56:19] lives that like, oh my god, I said that\n[56:23] I I sat down at my desk. like how\n[56:25] pitiful is this really how small I've\n[56:27] become. I should have this big cathedral\n[56:29] of achievements and monumental stuff.\n[56:32] You go, well, yeah, but how do you get\n[56:33] there? We got to lay the first break.\n[56:36] Um, so humility, being humble and uh\n[56:40] compassionate to yourself. Okay, I I I\n[56:43] did a thing today. I went for a walk,\n[56:45] felt like crap. I ate this bad sushi\n[56:47] last night and I, you know, I did one\n[56:49] thing did one thing, one small thing\n[56:51] that moved me toward my goal. So anyway,\n[56:53] >> maybe that's because we never get to see\n[56:55] that first small step. We get to see the\n[56:57] outcome. So if I'm thinking about\n[56:58] becoming a podcaster and following in\n[56:59] your footsteps,\n[57:00] >> I see you've got this [ __ ] digital\n[57:02] screen with where you've got Matthew\n[57:03] McConnA sat in the set of\n[57:05] >> I do\n[57:05] >> his movie and I'm thinking, \"Fuck, God,\n[57:08] that's a long way to go.\"\n[57:10] >> Well, the beautiful thing about a lot of\n[57:11] stuff on the internet is that uh it is\n[57:14] archived for the rest of time. So you\n[57:16] can go back and watch my first ever\n[57:17] episode, which is me in my old office\n[57:19] for the nightclub stuff that I did. And\n[57:21] my business partner yelled at me\n[57:22] afterward because I kicked everybody out\n[57:23] so that I could record. And he's like,\n[57:24] \"You can't keep doing this. It's not\n[57:25] your studio. It's our office.\" And it's\n[57:27] a single iPhone and a Blue Yeti USB mic\n[57:31] that looks like a big white dildo. And\n[57:32] it's up and over the top of the desk.\n[57:35] And it's me and a friend from the gym\n[57:36] talking about how we might row the\n[57:38] Atlantic one day.\n[57:39] >> Embarrassing to start there for someone\n[57:40] that's watching you do Matthew McConnA\n[57:42] in a digital screen. It's embarrassing,\n[57:43] >> but also not because that was the first\n[57:46] step. But that wasn't the first step.\n[57:47] The first step was deciding what name it\n[57:49] was going to be and then driving to\n[57:52] Gates Head to buy the Yeti secondhand\n[57:56] from some dude on eBay and that Yeti\n[57:59] went on to do 500 episodes of my podcast\n[58:02] and then we changed to nicer microphones\n[58:04] or something. So everybody's journey\n[58:07] begins embarrassingly small. And I think\n[58:09] just having a little bit of compassion\n[58:11] for yourself, having the humility to go\n[58:14] the first step that I do is going to be\n[58:17] so small that it it almost wouldn't\n[58:19] register on the ledger of\n[58:21] accomplishments. It would be minute\n[58:23] going, okay, that's still a win. First\n[58:26] thing, you don't know what to do. Second\n[58:29] thing, you know what to do, but you\n[58:31] don't know how to do it. So you can sit\n[58:33] down in front of the spreadsheet and you\n[58:36] know that you've got to do a VLOOKUP on\n[58:38] this spreadsheet. We have no idea how to\n[58:39] do a VLOOKUP. What's VLOOKUP? It's some\n[58:42] like some Excel thing that Excel nerds\n[58:44] will know. Um Chat GPT, Google, ring a\n[58:49] boss, ring a friend that is an expert in\n[58:52] Excel. So for me, when I look at my\n[58:54] procrastination, it occurs due to\n[58:56] usually one of two things. Poorly\n[58:58] defined next physical action. I don't\n[59:00] know exactly what the next smallest step\n[59:02] is that moves me toward my goal. I do\n[59:04] know that and I sit down. I don't know\n[59:05] how to do it. Like how do I like if you\n[59:08] don't know how to open a file, you don't\n[59:09] know how to unzip a file. Doesn't matter\n[59:12] how many files you've got in front of\n[59:13] you. If you can't unzip them, you can't\n[59:14] see them. So, okay, I need to learn. Hey\n[59:16] dude, I got this zip file. Where do I go\n[59:19] to get it? Oh. Oh, okay. Thank you. And\n[59:20] then we've got moving. So, it's either a\n[59:24] uh action issue or a skill issue. And\n[59:26] both of those are usually pretty simply\n[59:27] fixed. I was reading your newsletter,\n[59:29] you talk about how some people\n[59:31] procrastinate because they're scared of\n[59:33] what they'll find out about themselves.\n[59:34] >> Mhm.\n[59:35] >> If they try the thing, and I thought\n[59:37] that's so true.\n[59:38] >> Yeah. I mean, if you The upside of never\n[59:41] trying is never having to feel the pain\n[59:42] of failure,\n[59:44] >> right? If you never face that\n[59:48] discomfort, like if I tell myself that\n[59:51] all women are terrible, then I'm excused\n[59:53] of ever having to talk to a woman and as\n[59:55] a result I never have to feel the pain\n[59:57] of rejection. If I tell myself that\n[59:59] everything is [ __ ] or that things will\n[01:00:01] never get better, I'm excused of ever\n[01:00:03] having to try anything. It's more\n[01:00:05] comfortable to get fatalistic and call\n[01:00:07] it pragmatism. like the cope is framing\n[01:00:10] hope as pathetic and embarrassing and\n[01:00:13] optimism as delusion. This is cynicism,\n[01:00:16] right? Cynicism. And uh the opposite of\n[01:00:20] that is enthusiasm. Since moving to\n[01:00:22] America, I've been surrounded by very\n[01:00:23] enthusiastic people. Americans kind of\n[01:00:25] have permanent firstline cocaine energy.\n[01:00:30] And uh I like enthusiasm. I wish I\n[01:00:33] could, you know, export some of it back\n[01:00:34] to the UK. You know what I was really\n[01:00:36] disappointed by? I mean, you featured in\n[01:00:38] an article recently in a very well-known\n[01:00:40] British paper. Maybe this came across\n[01:00:42] your desk or maybe not.\n[01:00:43] >> No, I have no idea.\n[01:00:45] >> Okay. So, it was uh it was the same week\n[01:00:47] that the Spotify rap came out. Yeah.\n[01:00:49] >> And in the top 10 in the world, there's\n[01:00:50] me, you and J Shetty. There's three\n[01:00:52] Brits. I think we're punching above our\n[01:00:54] weight.\n[01:00:54] >> Yeah. %\n[01:00:56] >> with regards to this lady who wrote this\n[01:00:58] article basically said it was a\n[01:01:01] rejection of our patriotic inheritance\n[01:01:05] that we were trying to do\n[01:01:07] self-improvement at scale like whatever\n[01:01:10] happened to the British stiff upper\n[01:01:12] lipness where we sort of feel stoically\n[01:01:14] satisfied in our own loneliness and\n[01:01:16] misery that's like an almost an exact\n[01:01:19] quote\n[01:01:19] >> really\n[01:01:19] >> yeah it was really it really made me sad\n[01:01:22] and it made me sad for a few reasons\n[01:01:23] first stuff. The UK is not exactly\n[01:01:26] showering itself in glory at the moment.\n[01:01:28] There is an entire content bucket of\n[01:01:31] American streamers reacting to news from\n[01:01:33] the UK and going, \"Oh, the downfall of\n[01:01:36] the UK with the whatever.\" Whether\n[01:01:37] that's true or not, the optics aren't\n[01:01:39] great coming out of the UK at the\n[01:01:41] moment. And you've got three people who\n[01:01:44] have done it. I don't know whether Jay\n[01:01:46] is from workingass, but I'm from as\n[01:01:48] workingass as workingass can be. I know\n[01:01:50] that you're like even lower than me\n[01:01:51] somehow. Congratulations. and wherever\n[01:01:55] Jay's from, and you've managed to get\n[01:01:56] these three guys who are genuinely\n[01:01:59] trying to make the world a better place,\n[01:02:00] really working hard at it, and your main\n[01:02:03] takeaway was not during a time where the\n[01:02:05] UK is kind of eating [ __ ] on the global\n[01:02:07] stage. Congratulations to three people\n[01:02:09] who can show young entrepreneurs, people\n[01:02:13] that want to do personal development,\n[01:02:14] improve their own lives, that maybe you\n[01:02:16] can do it, too. And maybe we all got\n[01:02:18] lucky. I don't know. But it made me real\n[01:02:20] sad to read that. And this isn't just\n[01:02:22] that. I was like, it would have been\n[01:02:23] nice if the the UK like UK press had\n[01:02:25] backed us and said, \"Good on you guys.\"\n[01:02:27] But on top of that, it just reminded me\n[01:02:28] of a a mindset in the UK that\n[01:02:33] kind of has like Stockholm syndrome for\n[01:02:36] their own sad moments, for their own\n[01:02:39] like zero sum like tall poppy thing. And\n[01:02:43] I really don't like the tall poppy\n[01:02:44] syndrome in the UK. And uh it made me\n[01:02:46] sad to to to read that. If I had one\n[01:02:49] wish for people in the UK and if you're\n[01:02:51] listening now there's a high possibility\n[01:02:53] you're in the UK is\n[01:02:56] lift people up and be positive like clap\n[01:02:59] for strangers. If someone does something\n[01:03:01] if someone falls flat on their face in\n[01:03:03] the pursuit of a big goal clap for them.\n[01:03:04] Go that was amazing. At least you tried\n[01:03:06] because their success paves the way for\n[01:03:08] us all to fail and fall flat on our\n[01:03:10] face. But right now there's a bit of an\n[01:03:11] inversion of that. I was in San\n[01:03:13] Francisco last week and I swear to you\n[01:03:16] one woman came up to me. She told me\n[01:03:17] three times she had failed at her\n[01:03:19] startup. She's now back living with her\n[01:03:20] mom. And she wore it like a credential\n[01:03:22] in a badge of honor because in that room\n[01:03:23] it is.\n[01:03:24] >> But back home that's a hit piece. That's\n[01:03:27] a hit.\n[01:03:27] >> Look at this stupid delusional woman who\n[01:03:29] tried to do this thing. It's evidently\n[01:03:31] not going to work. How embarrassing.\n[01:03:33] >> Oh yeah. She she's her employees have\n[01:03:35] been let go. She owes this money. All\n[01:03:38] these things. It would be framed as a\n[01:03:39] negative. And actually when I read the\n[01:03:41] thing the the Spotify top 10 thing. Yes,\n[01:03:43] we're all doing self-improvement stuff.\n[01:03:45] But for me, that's kind of beside the\n[01:03:46] point. We we built media businesses and\n[01:03:49] there's not a lot of in terms of\n[01:03:51] competing with America and competing\n[01:03:52] with the rest of the world. It's crazy\n[01:03:54] that three British entrepreneurs managed\n[01:03:58] to contend with the United States, the\n[01:04:01] home of media, more capital, more brand\n[01:04:04] partners, more access to talent,\n[01:04:06] everything is here it seems. And for for\n[01:04:09] three Brits to do that, I was so proud.\n[01:04:11] I I actually don't need anyone to tell\n[01:04:12] me like to be like I was so proud of\n[01:04:14] you. I was so proud of Jay because that\n[01:04:16] is um it's a real underdog thing and\n[01:04:18] many of us started a lot later than the\n[01:04:22] people that\n[01:04:24] >> you know the Indiana Jones movie where\n[01:04:26] he's like running and the big door is\n[01:04:28] coming down the big stone door and it's\n[01:04:29] coming down real slow and he's running\n[01:04:31] running running. He slides underneath\n[01:04:32] and he grabs his hat as he comes in. I\n[01:04:34] kind of feel like that was us in the\n[01:04:35] podcasting WORLD. WE JUST SNUCK IN\n[01:04:37] before the sort of explosion and and you\n[01:04:40] know we rode uh rode the the the\n[01:04:42] increase in platform size. But yeah,\n[01:04:44] look dude,\n[01:04:46] having people around you that genuinely\n[01:04:48] are prepared to watch you take big\n[01:04:49] swings is something I wish I could gift\n[01:04:51] to the UK. Like the way that I would put\n[01:04:53] it is\n[01:04:55] Americans want you to succeed in case\n[01:04:58] you take them with you on the journey.\n[01:05:01] Mhm.\n[01:05:02] >> And the worst parts of British culture\n[01:05:06] don't want you to succeed in case you\n[01:05:07] leave them behind.\n[01:05:10] >> And I I know that there are so many\n[01:05:13] people that this is just a mimemetic\n[01:05:16] issue that if you had one key mover\n[01:05:19] within a group that that would start to\n[01:05:22] spread and spread and spread. But to the\n[01:05:25] people in the UK that are doers and are\n[01:05:26] builders and are actually making stuff\n[01:05:28] happen, like you have one of the hardest\n[01:05:31] jobs in the world, cuz not only have you\n[01:05:32] got to get over the lonely chapter, the\n[01:05:34] challenge, the difficulty, the\n[01:05:35] procrastination, the getting up early,\n[01:05:36] I've got to stop drinking, caffeine 90\n[01:05:37] minutes after waking, holy [ __ ] there's\n[01:05:39] so much on my plate, you have this\n[01:05:41] additional gravity of a culture that\n[01:05:44] doesn't tend to celebrate success and\n[01:05:46] risk-taking in quite the same way. So,\n[01:05:48] if that's you, I think like power to\n[01:05:51] you. I I really do. and there is a\n[01:05:55] community of people out there even if it\n[01:05:56] feels lonely. Now,\n[01:05:57] >> what do you think of the UK versus US\n[01:05:59] conversations generally? Do you think\n[01:06:01] it's really as bad as you hear on X or\n[01:06:04] on social media? Do you think the UK is\n[01:06:06] really as doomed?\n[01:06:07] >> I don't know, man. I mean, I hesitate. I\n[01:06:10] don't like to throw a ton of shade at\n[01:06:13] the country that I left three, four\n[01:06:15] years ago now. Uh because it does feel a\n[01:06:17] bit like pulling the ladder up after I\n[01:06:18] got you the last lifeboat off the\n[01:06:20] Titanic and me going like sorry I had my\n[01:06:22] problems while I was there. I had I had\n[01:06:24] my my criticisms of the UK while I was\n[01:06:27] still in the UK. I wish that people were\n[01:06:29] more positive some. I wish that there\n[01:06:30] was less tall poppy syndrome. I wish\n[01:06:32] that risk was um more celebrated. You\n[01:06:38] know, we have the same number of\n[01:06:42] universities in the top 10 in the world\n[01:06:43] as America,\n[01:06:45] >> but we produce 80% fewer entrepreneurs.\n[01:06:48] >> And what is entrepreneurialism? It's\n[01:06:50] like vision. It's risk-taking. It's\n[01:06:52] being prepared to do something that\n[01:06:53] hasn't been done before. and uh that\n[01:06:57] maybe there's some something else I'm\n[01:07:00] not seeing that's a part of the maybe\n[01:07:01] it's the weather you know maybe it's the\n[01:07:03] fact that we're a waterlocked island or\n[01:07:05] that the population density is 10 times\n[01:07:07] that of the US but there's something I\n[01:07:10] feel like bottom up that's putting a bit\n[01:07:11] of a restriction on people and and and\n[01:07:13] yeah it was a shame it was a shame to\n[01:07:15] see that the UK press was\n[01:07:19] just living out the exact cultural\n[01:07:22] script that I assumed that they would\n[01:07:24] Um, shame. Shame.\n[01:07:27] >> Do you know something I've noticed? Most\n[01:07:29] commercial teams aren't tested by their\n[01:07:31] targets. They're tested by the weight of\n[01:07:33] the admin that comes with every client.\n[01:07:35] All the follow-ups, all the meetings,\n[01:07:37] all the notes, the timelines that never\n[01:07:38] ever stop. These were a constant source\n[01:07:41] of friction in my commercial team until\n[01:07:43] I introduced our sponsor, Pipe Drive. If\n[01:07:45] you're not familiar, Pipe Drive is a\n[01:07:47] simple but powerful sales CRM that gives\n[01:07:49] you visibility on any deals through a\n[01:07:51] sales pipeline. It also automates a lot\n[01:07:53] of the tedious, repetitive, and\n[01:07:55] timeconsuming tasks that come with the\n[01:07:57] sales process. I've used it across my\n[01:07:58] investments for almost a decade now,\n[01:08:00] even when I was at Social Chain. And\n[01:08:02] it's so effective in part because it's\n[01:08:03] customizable.

Have we closed off the\n[01:08:31] book of uh things that really one of the\n[01:08:33] things I've read in your newsletter as\n[01:08:34] well as relates to productivity is just\n[01:08:36] this idea that a lack of confidence\n[01:08:37] kills more dreams than a lack of skill.\n[01:08:39] >> Mhm.\n[01:08:40] >> And confidence I think is maybe one of\n[01:08:42] those big foundational things that sits\n[01:08:44] at the very top of the stack of dominoes\n[01:08:47] to be able to do anything which is like\n[01:08:49] do I actually believe I'll be able to?\n[01:08:50] Mhm. Well, let me give you this. Uh,\n[01:08:54] I think a lot of people assume that\n[01:08:56] self-belief is kind of the answer to\n[01:09:00] what it is that they're looking to do.\n[01:09:03] You can just do things.\n[01:09:06] You can just do it anyway.\n[01:09:08] You can do it tired.\n[01:09:10] You can do it with no self-belief.\n[01:09:13] You can do it when you don't want to.\n[01:09:16] You can do it when you think it's not\n[01:09:17] going to work. You can just do things.\n[01:09:21] And I've learned that you can have no\n[01:09:24] self-esteem and show up anyway.\n[01:09:27] You can have no self-belief and things\n[01:09:29] still go well. Ryan Holidayiday says,\n[01:09:32] \"Self-belief is overrated. Generate\n[01:09:34] evidence.\"\n[01:09:38] [ __ ] yeah. I want evidence.\n[01:09:41] Want an undeniable stack of proof that I\n[01:09:43] am who I say I am. And I I am I am the\n[01:09:45] poster boy for imposter syndrome, dude.\n[01:09:47] Like I I never assumed that I would\n[01:09:49] amount to really anything,\n[01:09:53] but I'm pretty stubborn. And being\n[01:09:55] stubborn has meant that I've just kept\n[01:09:56] showing up. And uh that stubbornness\n[01:09:59] feels even more in reach than\n[01:10:01] consistency. Consistency is pretty in\n[01:10:02] reach, right? Don't miss two days in a\n[01:10:04] row. All right. Well, [ __ ] write\n[01:10:07] write 500 words a week. Start a Substack\n[01:10:09] and write 500 words a week. You can\n[01:10:11] probably do that. You can probably find\n[01:10:12] 500 words a week. It'll take you half an\n[01:10:13] hour. Write 500 words a week. After a\n[01:10:15] year, you're a writer. Congratulations.\n[01:10:16] You're a writer. You have the license to\n[01:10:18] be able to call yourself a writer. How\n[01:10:19] fantastic. And then who knows in four\n[01:10:23] years time you've got Penguin came\n[01:10:25] knocking. Maybe there's a book deal for\n[01:10:26] you. How fantastic with that? I'm a\n[01:10:28] published author with Penguin. How\n[01:10:30] fantastic is that?\n[01:10:32] But it starts by just going\n[01:10:35] I'm going to see what happens if I do\n[01:10:37] this little thing.\n[01:10:37] >> So interesting as you said that I\n[01:10:39] thought you know what when I started I\n[01:10:41] had no evidence. Definitely didn't have\n[01:10:43] belief that I could do what I've done\n[01:10:44] over the last sort of 1015 years of my\n[01:10:46] life. But I also had no choice because\n[01:10:48] of that internal void. So\n[01:10:50] >> yeah,\n[01:10:51] >> I had no evidence but no choice.\n[01:10:52] >> That's the that's the region beta thing\n[01:10:53] that you mentioned earlier on. So um the\n[01:10:56] region beta paradox. Imagine that if you\n[01:10:59] were going to travel less than a mile,\n[01:11:01] you'd walk it. If you're going to travel\n[01:11:04] a mile or more, you would drive it.\n[01:11:06] Paradoxically, you would travel 2 miles\n[01:11:08] quicker than you would travel one mile.\n[01:11:10] You jump in the car. And what this\n[01:11:12] suggests is that if we only act when\n[01:11:15] things cross a certain threshold of\n[01:11:16] badness,\n[01:11:18] worse things can be better than better\n[01:11:20] things. So for instance, the person who\n[01:11:23] lives in an apartment and it's in a kind\n[01:11:26] of a sketchy area of town and there's a\n[01:11:27] little bit of mold on the ceiling and\n[01:11:29] the housemates's kind of a bit weird,\n[01:11:30] but it's really cheap and they quite\n[01:11:33] like the bed and it's not too far from\n[01:11:35] their work. Uh, someone's in a\n[01:11:37] relationship and their partner's not\n[01:11:38] abusive or mean to them, but they're not\n[01:11:40] really that fired up and don't really\n[01:11:42] see that much of a future with them. Or\n[01:11:44] the person who's got a job and their\n[01:11:45] boss is a bit of a dick and it doesn't\n[01:11:47] pay that well, but it's really cushy and\n[01:11:49] they don't actually have to work that\n[01:11:50] hard. All of these people would be\n[01:11:52] better off if their situations were\n[01:11:54] worse because it would galvanize them to\n[01:11:57] go and do something. And this zone of\n[01:12:00] comfortable complacency that people get\n[01:12:02] into is where they can sit for a very\n[01:12:04] long time. And this is a really\n[01:12:06] dangerous one. Things aren't bad enough\n[01:12:07] to be bad, but they're nowhere near good\n[01:12:09] enough to be good. And this\n[01:12:13] sort of gray zone, this liinal space,\n[01:12:15] this sort of like productivity purgatory\n[01:12:18] that you sit in just sort of allows you\n[01:12:21] to keep moving forward. You're not\n[01:12:22] moving toward what you want, but there's\n[01:12:24] not enough discomfort to get you to do\n[01:12:25] it. One of the most uh spicy questions\n[01:12:28] that's been asked at one of my live\n[01:12:29] talks about this was um should I\n[01:12:31] purposefully make my life worse so that\n[01:12:34] it kicks me out the bottom of region\n[01:12:35] beta? I'm like it's a high-risisk\n[01:12:37] strategy. I wouldn't I wouldn't\n[01:12:39] recommend it but it is a difficulty.\n[01:12:41] >> As you were saying that I was thinking\n[01:12:42] about how our relationship with that\n[01:12:44] uncertainty is going to define our lives\n[01:12:45] and that a lot of people are choosing\n[01:12:47] certain misery over the uncertainty that\n[01:12:49] you'll encounter as you go and search\n[01:12:50] for more. And I always almost almost\n[01:12:52] imagine it as being stood on the edge of\n[01:12:53] a cliff and the part of the cliff I'm on\n[01:12:56] is illuminated. I know it. It's not\n[01:12:58] great, but I know it.\n[01:13:00] >> And then I look off into the the abyss\n[01:13:01] and I've got to jump into this\n[01:13:03] uncertainty. I don't know if there's\n[01:13:04] land there. I don't know what what's in\n[01:13:06] there. And I think people's relationship\n[01:13:08] with with uncertainty defines their\n[01:13:10] entire life. Like can you quit when it's\n[01:13:12] meh?\n[01:13:14] And I look back on my life and go, if\n[01:13:16] there is one defining skill, maybe\n[01:13:18] because of of this sort of internal\n[01:13:20] void, it's been not overstaying my\n[01:13:22] welcome by many days in a situation\n[01:13:25] >> that pushes back against your I say yes\n[01:13:27] too much. It seems like you do have the\n[01:13:28] capacity to be able to quit when\n[01:13:32] >> Oh, yeah. But it's it's I mean, so these\n[01:13:34] are like big life decisions. And what\n[01:13:35] I'm talking about when I say I don't say\n[01:13:37] no enough is like\n[01:13:39] gradual clutter. Right.\n[01:13:42] >> Gradual clutter being uh you start\n[01:13:46] starting a newsletter when I have no\n[01:13:47] time to write. Whereas when I'm thinking\n[01:13:49] about this uncertainty, it's like went\n[01:13:52] to university, lasted a day, never went\n[01:13:54] back.\n[01:13:55] >> Walked in, thought this is like school\n[01:13:57] where where I failed, never went back.\n[01:13:59] Built a company, was going well, raising\n[01:14:01] investment, very successful, quit out of\n[01:14:03] the blue, started this other company\n[01:14:05] called Social Chain. Did that up until\n[01:14:06] the age of 27. 10 days before we're\n[01:14:09] about to go on this IPO road show for\n[01:14:10] the company to up this to a new stock\n[01:14:11] market reached this point where I'm like\n[01:14:15] even though my entire identity is this\n[01:14:17] social chain guy and even though we're\n[01:14:18] about to raise this money and the\n[01:14:19] company would eventually rally up to\n[01:14:21] what being worth 4 500 million on the\n[01:14:23] Frankfurt stock exchange\n[01:14:25] I'm going to jump off into nothingness\n[01:14:27] I'm going to leave it all with no plan B\n[01:14:30] and that's when I reflect on my life and\n[01:14:31] go oh like in the big moments I've not\n[01:14:34] required I've not needed certainty what\n[01:14:36] I've needed is uh realization that this\n[01:14:39] certain misery is not what I want.\n[01:14:40] >> That's brave. Do you know what I'm\n[01:14:42] saying? Like I I look at people's\n[01:14:43] decisioning and their life story through\n[01:14:44] this lens, which is like how much\n[01:14:47] conviction do you need that you're in\n[01:14:49] the wrong place? Obama said on stage\n[01:14:52] when I spoke at this event um that he\n[01:14:53] spoke at many years ago that on his big\n[01:14:55] decisions in life, he gets to 51%\n[01:14:57] certainty and then makes the decision\n[01:14:58] with the peace of mind that he made the\n[01:15:00] decision with the best available\n[01:15:01] evidence. He talked about getting Osama\n[01:15:02] bin Laden in that compound in Pakistan.\n[01:15:04] He had never seen that he was there, but\n[01:15:06] he he risked two Apache helicopters of\n[01:15:09] lives and\n[01:15:10] >> like what percentage of certainty do you\n[01:15:13] need to make a big decision I think is a\n[01:15:15] determinant for the long-term success\n[01:15:18] you'll have in your life. Some people\n[01:15:19] need to get to like 95%. And you never\n[01:15:22] get there in most things.\n[01:15:23] >> Yeah. It's the difference in uh\n[01:15:25] behavioral economics between maximizing\n[01:15:28] and satisficing. It's like the two the\n[01:15:30] two terms like basically what's your\n[01:15:32] threshold for conviction? Yeah.\n[01:15:34] >> You know the paradox of choice by Barry\n[01:15:36] Schwarz. Do you know this? Okay. So\n[01:15:38] Barry Schwarz uses this wonderful\n[01:15:40] example of people buying jeans 50 years\n[01:15:42] ago going into the jeans store. You go\n[01:15:45] in and there is one type of jeans.\n[01:15:48] There's maybe different sizes maybe. And\n[01:15:50] you go in, you buy the pair of jeans,\n[01:15:52] you leave. Maybe they're not the perfect\n[01:15:53] jeans that you wanted, but you had no\n[01:15:56] other choice, right? So you got them. So\n[01:15:57] you're okay with your decision. Would\n[01:15:59] have been happier if there was others,\n[01:16:00] but there wasn't. So, your decision\n[01:16:02] regret is basically zero. Roll the clock\n[01:16:05] forward. It's 2025. You go into the\n[01:16:07] jeans store. Do you want skinny or\n[01:16:09] stretch? Do you want boot cut? Do you\n[01:16:10] want ripped? Do you want bleach? Do you\n[01:16:12] want gray, blue, black? If you walk out\n[01:16:15] of the jean store with a suboptimal pair\n[01:16:18] of jeans. This is no longer because of\n[01:16:20] restriction from the environment. This\n[01:16:22] is because of your inability to make the\n[01:16:23] right choice.\n[01:16:24] >> And this causes people to fear making\n[01:16:27] choices. They project the potential\n[01:16:29] regret they're fearful of in the future\n[01:16:31] down into the present and it causes\n[01:16:33] decision paralysis. So they don't do\n[01:16:34] anything. They think there's so many\n[01:16:36] different options here. And this is one\n[01:16:37] of the paradoxes where you think, well,\n[01:16:39] lots of choice allows you to maximize\n[01:16:41] what you want. You get the perfect pair\n[01:16:42] of jeans. So why is it that firstly\n[01:16:45] people tend to be less satisfied with\n[01:16:48] their decisions when they're given more\n[01:16:49] options and secondly why so many people\n[01:16:51] struggle to make decisions in the first\n[01:16:53] place? all because they're paralyzed by\n[01:16:55] the overanalysis they have of all of the\n[01:16:57] different optionality that's in front of\n[01:16:58] them.\n[01:16:59] >> Overanalysis paralysis.\n[01:17:04] Jeff Bezos's Amazon thing about type\n[01:17:06] one, type two doors is really useful\n[01:17:07] here because when kids come up to me at\n[01:17:08] the tours and stuff that I've done,\n[01:17:10] >> most of the time the question they're\n[01:17:12] asking me can be answered with with a\n[01:17:13] rebuttal, which is, \"If you're wrong,\n[01:17:15] could you go back?\"\n[01:17:16] >> Like, \"If you're wrong about quitting\n[01:17:18] that job at City Bank, would City Bank\n[01:17:20] have you back?\" or Santandere,\n[01:17:23] >> whoever, but you've been there for three\n[01:17:24] or four years. You're like a high\n[01:17:25] performer. You're killing it. You could\n[01:17:26] do it with your eyes closed. Of course,\n[01:17:27] they're going to have you back. In fact,\n[01:17:28] you probably get a pay rise if you go to\n[01:17:30] their competitor. So, in such a\n[01:17:31] scenario, go be the violinist in Peru\n[01:17:33] and do the cupcake thing.\n[01:17:34] >> Like the start the cupcake store because\n[01:17:36] if you're wrong,\n[01:17:37] >> you can always go back. And that\n[01:17:39] honestly, when I say that to kids, it's\n[01:17:41] almost like the most common rebuttal I\n[01:17:42] give them, which is like, if you're\n[01:17:43] wrong about this dream you have, would\n[01:17:45] you be welcomed back to your current\n[01:17:46] life?\n[01:17:47] >> Well, think about this. If you're\n[01:17:48] succeeding at a job that you hate,\n[01:17:50] imagine how great you'd be at one that\n[01:17:51] you loved.\n[01:17:52] >> If you're not fired up about the thing\n[01:17:54] that you're doing today and you're still\n[01:17:57] winning,\n[01:18:00] what could happen if you actually\n[01:18:02] enjoyed you were fired up when you woke\n[01:18:03] up in the morning? Imagine that.\n[01:18:06] >> Some people have never experienced to\n[01:18:07] know that it's possible.\n[01:18:08] >> It's tough, man. And lots of people have\n[01:18:10] got real world restrictions, which\n[01:18:11] [ __ ] blows. But there's always\n[01:18:14] something that you can do that's little.\n[01:18:15] Another question people can ask\n[01:18:17] themselves when reflecting on last year.\n[01:18:19] What are some of the thoughts that you\n[01:18:21] repeated too many times this year? What\n[01:18:24] are the things that came up over and\n[01:18:25] over? That little voice in the back of\n[01:18:26] your head, that conversation that you\n[01:18:28] need to have?\n[01:18:31] >> What are the thoughts you repeated too\n[01:18:33] many times this year to the point that\n[01:18:35] it caused harm or distraction? It it\n[01:18:39] plagued you. There's this thing that's\n[01:18:40] there. [ __ ] Like that thing that my\n[01:18:43] partner said to me 18 months ago over\n[01:18:46] dinner is still in the back of my mind\n[01:18:48] and I'm I'm ashamed of bringing it up to\n[01:18:50] them. I'm even more ashamed to bring it\n[01:18:51] up to them now because they're probably\n[01:18:52] not even going to remember it. But they\n[01:18:53] said they said this thing or they looked\n[01:18:55] at the waiter that way or or my boss\n[01:19:00] mentioned something in an email that\n[01:19:02] made me feel like they they really don't\n[01:19:03] value me and I really and it's just over\n[01:19:05] and over or [ __ ] I need to I need to\n[01:19:08] sort my diet out. I need to sort my diet\n[01:19:10] out. I should sort my diet. I can't sort\n[01:19:11] my diet out. I'm going to sort my diet\n[01:19:12] out. I should sort I can't over and over\n[01:19:14] and over again. What are the thoughts\n[01:19:17] that plagued you this year? What are the\n[01:19:18] ones that kept on happening over and\n[01:19:20] over and over and over again? And\n[01:19:21] typically from that there is a\n[01:19:24] conversation that you need to have\n[01:19:27] or there is an emotion that you're\n[01:19:28] unprepared to feel. So another great\n[01:19:31] question, what are the emotions that\n[01:19:32] you're unprepared to feel? If fear comes\n[01:19:34] up, do you run away from it? You\n[01:19:36] distract yourself away from it. You\n[01:19:37] drink yourself away from it. You lift\n[01:19:38] yourself away from it. What are the\n[01:19:39] emotions you're unprepared to feel?\n[01:19:41] >> And you're safe to feel these emotions.\n[01:19:44] You can just sit there. It\n[01:19:45] >> It's interesting because as you said\n[01:19:46] that, I thought about how the framing of\n[01:19:49] 85-year-old me was actually such a\n[01:19:50] wonderful way to understand this because\n[01:19:53] I know the question we asked earlier was\n[01:19:55] what would 85-year-old you like really\n[01:19:56] be annoyed that you did today. But the\n[01:19:58] inverse of that is like 85year-old\n[01:20:00] Steven is just going to wish I took care\n[01:20:02] of my body more.\n[01:20:04] >> It's like just it's not going to care\n[01:20:05] about the money. It's going to go, \"You\n[01:20:07] can't walk up a [ __ ] hill, my guy.\n[01:20:08] your you your glutes have blown out and\n[01:20:10] you don't have flexibility and you're\n[01:20:11] hunched over and you you lose uh\n[01:20:14] respiratory\n[01:20:16] um you can't walk upstairs without being\n[01:20:18] out of breath.\n[01:20:19] >> Mhm.\n[01:20:20] >> And it's so interesting that if like\n[01:20:21] 85year-old me is going to be so pissed\n[01:20:23] off that I didn't take care of my body\n[01:20:26] more.\n[01:20:28] >> It's even as someone that seems to take\n[01:20:30] care of their body quite a bit.\n[01:20:32] >> But still, yeah, you're making trades. I\n[01:20:35] I'd love, you know, what would I do to\n[01:20:36] make 85-year-old me miserable and what\n[01:20:38] would 85-year-old me want me to do more\n[01:20:40] of?\n[01:20:40] >> They're great great frames. Let me give\n[01:20:42] you a couple on uh problems and stress.\n[01:20:44] So, one of the issues that people come\n[01:20:47] up against is you've got the start of\n[01:20:50] the year, this wideeyed blue sky vision\n[01:20:54] for what's going to happen. And even\n[01:20:57] though you know that stuff's going to\n[01:20:59] come and sort of get in the way, it\n[01:21:01] always feels unfair when it does.\n[01:21:03] shouldn't be this way. We sort of rail\n[01:21:05] against the the road bumps that we have\n[01:21:08] along the way. So, uh, six lessons about\n[01:21:12] problems and stress. Number one,\n[01:21:14] problems are a feature of life, not a\n[01:21:16] bug. There will never come a time when\n[01:21:19] you have no problems. What did you you\n[01:21:21] think you were going to wake up one day\n[01:21:24] and there be no more problems? Like\n[01:21:26] completing a video game level and going\n[01:21:28] to a map where there's nothing there,\n[01:21:30] right? things\n[01:21:33] are always going to incur problems. Your\n[01:21:36] problems will change, but having\n[01:21:37] problems is going nowhere. Uh number\n[01:21:40] two, whatever negativity is consuming\n[01:21:42] your thoughts probably won't matter in 3\n[01:21:45] months time. Like in 3 months, you won't\n[01:21:48] remember the corrosive texture of your\n[01:21:50] own mind or the boring repetitive things\n[01:21:52] that you thought or or maybe even what\n[01:21:55] you worried about. I think what were you\n[01:21:57] worrying about 3 months ago right now?\n[01:21:59] Probably can't remember. don't remember,\n[01:22:01] >> but all of the time that you spent\n[01:22:03] worrying will have passed. So, you're\n[01:22:06] sacrificing your joy and your presence\n[01:22:08] in the moment for a problem that you\n[01:22:10] won't even be able to recall in the\n[01:22:12] future. So, immortality would kind of be\n[01:22:15] the only life where so much flippency\n[01:22:18] with the the time that we have would be\n[01:22:20] acceptable. Learning comes from the\n[01:22:22] edges. Number three, change is\n[01:22:24] uncomfortable and it rarely occurs\n[01:22:27] without a lot of stress. Learning comes\n[01:22:29] from the edges.\n[01:22:30] >> From the edges.\n[01:22:31] >> Pro approximate zone of development.\n[01:22:33] >> What does that mean?\n[01:22:34] >> You pushing yourself just beyond what\n[01:22:36] you're comfortable with. And sometimes\n[01:22:38] this can be emotional pain too. Leaving\n[01:22:40] the job happens when you get pushed out\n[01:22:42] of region beta on the bottom end or\n[01:22:44] growth happens when you overextend\n[01:22:46] yourself the right amount. Not so much\n[01:22:48] that you get injured, but so much that\n[01:22:50] you're challenged. That this is a new\n[01:22:51] zone for you to get into. I'm clawing\n[01:22:53] up. Wow. And it expands your potential,\n[01:22:55] your idea of what you're able to do. And\n[01:22:58] it's like it pushes you so that your\n[01:23:01] system becomes more resilient on the\n[01:23:02] other side.\n[01:23:04] Many of the periods of radical important\n[01:23:06] change that you have had in your life\n[01:23:09] have only occurred because of severe\n[01:23:10] challenges you faced. Like look back\n[01:23:14] almost all of the big periods of growth\n[01:23:16] in your life have germinated from your\n[01:23:18] lowest points.\n[01:23:21] In retrospect would you have avoided\n[01:23:24] them if you could? Probably not.\n[01:23:28] So yeah, this challenge is a gift. You\n[01:23:31] can uh lean into discomfort as if you\n[01:23:34] invited it through the door. It's like,\n[01:23:36] oh, there we are. Hello.\n[01:23:39] It's good to see you.\n[01:23:41] >> What thoughts did you repeat too many\n[01:23:42] times this year?\n[01:23:43] >> You're working too much.\n[01:23:45] >> Okay, so this is a recurring theme here.\n[01:23:46] >> Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Again, the big\n[01:23:48] questions, the big problems are the big\n[01:23:50] problems.\n[01:23:50] >> And you want to orientate your life\n[01:23:52] towards just having bigger gaps of\n[01:23:54] emptiness. Uh, but probably filling it\n[01:23:56] with other stuff. Family, same as you. I\n[01:23:59] can't wait to be a dad or dog. I should\n[01:24:01] have a dog. I should have a dog. How\n[01:24:02] many times have I thought the thought I\n[01:24:03] should have a dog? Get a golden\n[01:24:04] retriever.\n[01:24:05] >> I saw a tweet which has kind of haunted\n[01:24:07] me for 12 months. The tweet said, \"Why\n[01:24:10] do all the big male podcasters not have\n[01:24:12] kids?\"\n[01:24:14] >> All the big male podcasters not have\n[01:24:15] kids. They all talk about the population\n[01:24:17] crisis and this that and the other. And\n[01:24:19] then it was like Chris Williamson,\n[01:24:21] Huberman, Lex, Steven. None of them.\n[01:24:25] >> Jay got kids.\n[01:24:26] >> Jay Shetty.\n[01:24:27] >> Yeah. No. Okay. Yeah. But then also\n[01:24:29] Tucker Carlson's breeding a lot. Uh he's\n[01:24:32] he was number 10. Rogan's got like three\n[01:24:35] daughters, I think. Three or four\n[01:24:36] daughters. So\n[01:24:37] >> Rogan's the only one that But think\n[01:24:39] about it as well. There's a generational\n[01:24:41] difference here. Like Tucker and Rogan\n[01:24:43] are of the same generation. And this\n[01:24:45] younger generation of like\n[01:24:46] >> It's very flattering for Andrew Huberman\n[01:24:48] in his 50s, but\n[01:24:48] >> Oh, yeah. [ __ ] Yeah. But why why is\n[01:24:51] that? Why don't we have kids?\n[01:24:54] I I mean it's a it's a great question.\n[01:24:56] Um for me, I spent a lot of time in my\n[01:24:59] 20ies really trying to work out who I\n[01:25:01] was. I had my head up my own ass. Like\n[01:25:03] I'm happy to say that I had a uh slow\n[01:25:06] development psychologically in terms of\n[01:25:09] becoming the person I wanted to in terms\n[01:25:10] of realizing how important different\n[01:25:13] things were to me. Like how long have\n[01:25:15] you known\n[01:25:17] felt it I should have kids?\n[01:25:20] I've always wanted kids, but I've not\n[01:25:22] put steps in place to make that happen.\n[01:25:25] Um, up until the last two years. And you\n[01:25:29] know what's crazy? I'm completely\n[01:25:30] unprepared. I am my life as it is now is\n[01:25:34] not ready for kids.\n[01:25:35] >> I fly too much. I'm too busy. I have too\n[01:25:37] many prior other priorities\n[01:25:39] >> in order to pick something up.\n[01:25:40] >> Yeah. But something down.\n[01:25:41] >> But I have this sort of meta view which\n[01:25:43] is the big step up in meaning in my life\n[01:25:45] will probably come from that. So even\n[01:25:46] though there's no emotion in my body\n[01:25:48] that's telling me that this is a good\n[01:25:50] idea,\n[01:25:50] >> close my eyes and do it and I will\n[01:25:54] adjust.\n[01:25:54] >> I will adjust to the responsibility as I\n[01:25:56] always have. There was no room in my\n[01:25:57] life for a podcast when I started this\n[01:25:59] podcast,\n[01:25:59] >> right?\n[01:26:00] >> But I adjusted. And so it goes against\n[01:26:03] every inclination that I have to have\n[01:26:05] children right now as a as a as a man\n[01:26:07] that has freedom, who is 33 years old,\n[01:26:11] who can go wherever he wants, whenever\n[01:26:12] he wants, and doesn't really have to\n[01:26:13] answer to any major responsibilities\n[01:26:15] outside of my\n[01:26:16] >> Do you like that? Do you like the fact\n[01:26:18] that you don't have dependence in that\n[01:26:21] way?\n[01:26:22] >> If you ask this brain,\n[01:26:24] >> yes, I like freedom. I like the fact\n[01:26:27] that I after this conversation I can\n[01:26:30] work on my business, go to the gym, go\n[01:26:31] wherever I want, fly somewhere, go to\n[01:26:33] Hawaii. I like the freedom. However,\n[01:26:36] there's this like meta brain\n[01:26:40] >> that is my regret brain and it lives 50\n[01:26:42] years from now and it's been inspired by\n[01:26:44] all the conversations I've had on the\n[01:26:46] podcast and it says to me that actually\n[01:26:48] the most meaningful thing you can do is\n[01:26:50] increase the amount of dependence and\n[01:26:51] responsibility that you have.\n[01:26:53] >> This is an unteachable lesson, dude.\n[01:26:54] that uh you should probably have kids\n[01:26:58] now, right? That could be a could be a\n[01:27:00] lesson perhaps.\n[01:27:01] >> Yeah.\n[01:27:01] >> That you will never feel ready. That\n[01:27:03] could be an unteable lesson.\n[01:27:04] >> We have this population decline\n[01:27:06] situation going on.\n[01:27:07] >> Mhm.\n[01:27:08] >> And\n[01:27:10] is it it's is it not a function of or a\n[01:27:14] consequence of the fact that we have\n[01:27:16] more freedom, more control, we're like\n[01:27:17] more nihilistic. We we\n[01:27:20] >> it's more like me me. M\n[01:27:22] >> now there's like a subtle narcissism\n[01:27:24] which is bred in society and look I I\n[01:27:26] ain't got kids but just so you know lads\n[01:27:29] that are watching I'm doing everything\n[01:27:31] in my power some things that I can't\n[01:27:33] actually tell you about but I'm doing\n[01:27:34] everything in my power to to have kids\n[01:27:36] as soon as possible.\n[01:27:38] >> Okay.\n[01:27:38] >> So I I imagine that I'll be a father\n[01:27:39] >> that just sounds like shagging all the\n[01:27:41] time.\n[01:27:42] >> Well, yeah.\n[01:27:42] >> Okay.\n[01:27:43] >> But I think I'll be a dad within the\n[01:27:45] next 12 months.\n[01:27:46] >> Amazing.\n[01:27:46] >> And I I and I I have to say this again\n[01:27:49] because it's so important. Like there's\n[01:27:51] no part of me in this moment of time\n[01:27:52] that's like, \"Oh, I really really want\n[01:27:54] to be a dad.\" I can see the cost, but\n[01:27:57] the benefit is unknown. I have to take\n[01:27:59] other people's words for it.\n[01:28:00] >> It's crazy, dude. It's it's a a painful\n[01:28:03] realization. And um I've had some of the\n[01:28:06] best demographers in the world on uh\n[01:28:08] Lyman Stone uh from the Institute for\n[01:28:10] Family Studies, Steven J. Shaw who did\n[01:28:12] the birth gap documentary. Uh these\n[01:28:14] people know what's going on and it's a\n[01:28:17] it's a function of a lot of things. It's\n[01:28:19] a a function of people having other\n[01:28:21] stuff to do. There are so many other\n[01:28:23] things to do than have kids. Uh reliable\n[01:28:26] contraception. That means that you can\n[01:28:28] choose to put it off. You can continue\n[01:28:30] to push it off for as long as you want.\n[01:28:32] Specifically, uh women's socioeconomic\n[01:28:35] emancipation into the workforce and in\n[01:28:38] higher education. That means that at 18,\n[01:28:43] the first thing you do isn't get\n[01:28:44] married. Oh, I'm going to go to\n[01:28:45] university. Well, I've just put three or\n[01:28:46] four years into university. I'm going to\n[01:28:48] now go and get a job and now I've\n[01:28:49] committed to the job. I'm going to maybe\n[01:28:50] climb the corporate ladder. That's\n[01:28:52] pushed the vitality curve back. It's\n[01:28:54] made it later rather than being earlier.\n[01:28:56] And another problem is because there is\n[01:28:57] such a multiplicity of different life\n[01:28:59] directions that people can go down. The\n[01:29:01] likelihood of you being ready at 22 and\n[01:29:04] you meeting someone else who's also\n[01:29:05] ready at 22 is actually quite low. So if\n[01:29:08] you think that you could have a graph\n[01:29:09] like this uh vitality curve it's called\n[01:29:11] by Steven Shaw and previously it would\n[01:29:13] have been very short and and sharp and\n[01:29:15] spiky and that would be like when people\n[01:29:17] want to have kids it's like you know\n[01:29:19] from 18 to 24 let's say if you meet\n[01:29:22] anybody within that age range it's\n[01:29:23] likely that they're at the same life\n[01:29:24] situation as you as you flatten that\n[01:29:27] curve make it longer and you also push\n[01:29:30] it a little bit later you're now 35 to\n[01:29:34] meet somebody that's also 35 and ready\n[01:29:35] to have kids but you meet some that not\n[01:29:37] because there's too much area under the\n[01:29:39] curve that's flat as opposed to\n[01:29:41] everybody kind of dancing to the same\n[01:29:43] tune. They're all dancing to different\n[01:29:44] tunes.\n[01:29:45] >> Uh so that contributes to it. I\n[01:29:48] certainly think that there is a anti-f\n[01:29:51] family message that comes about that\n[01:29:54] there's a girl with the list on Tik Tok\n[01:29:56] which I think is this girl who wrote 350\n[01:30:00] reasons to not have kids. It's like\n[01:30:01] eight pages, nine pages long and it went\n[01:30:04] super viral and it's everything from\n[01:30:06] literally a parasite growing inside of\n[01:30:08] your body to can't wear cute heels with\n[01:30:11] the girls, will have to miss brunch, all\n[01:30:13] of the different issues that can occur\n[01:30:14] during childirth and then I think there\n[01:30:16] was a a list of things for kids and it\n[01:30:20] was like maybe a page a half a page long\n[01:30:21] that she'd written and um we she is open\n[01:30:25] to seeing the world as she wishes. I\n[01:30:27] think by the sounds of things, it is a\n[01:30:29] really good idea that she's not a\n[01:30:30] mother. And I'm glad that she's choosing\n[01:30:32] to not have kids. But that tone, that\n[01:30:37] sentiment is like prevalent because\n[01:30:39] people see this is what I have to\n[01:30:41] sacrifice now.\n[01:30:44] Pain, discomfort, lack of freedom\n[01:30:48] for something that I have no idea about\n[01:30:50] whether or not it's going to make me\n[01:30:52] satisfied in future. And yeah, maybe\n[01:30:56] people say it's the most important thing\n[01:30:58] or whatever, but it's easy to excuse\n[01:30:59] away when there are so many other things\n[01:31:01] I can do with my life. I can travel\n[01:31:02] around Bali and I can watch Netflix and\n[01:31:04] I could build a business and I could\n[01:31:05] start a substack or I could build a\n[01:31:07] YouTube channel and do a podcast. All of\n[01:31:08] these things you could do. Pushing off,\n[01:31:11] pushing off, pushing off. It's no\n[01:31:12] surprise. And the final point is I think\n[01:31:15] um having kids is mimemetic. So\n[01:31:17] >> what does that mean?\n[01:31:18] >> Uh you model the behavior of the people\n[01:31:20] that are around you and the people that\n[01:31:21] you see. So good example of this Uh,\n[01:31:24] South Korea's got one of the worst birth\n[01:31:26] rates in the world. It's uh for every\n[01:31:29] hundred South Koreans, there will be\n[01:31:31] four great grandchildren. A 96%\n[01:31:34] reduction over the next century. It's\n[01:31:35] insane. There are entire classrooms,\n[01:31:37] whole schools in South Korea that are\n[01:31:39] unoccupied now. And um there are many\n[01:31:42] many reasons. the 4Bs movement, uh the\n[01:31:45] the um increasing of women's acceptance\n[01:31:48] into education, and then when they got\n[01:31:50] into the workforce, they were still\n[01:31:52] being prejudiced against, which meant\n[01:31:54] that they swore off a lot of the things\n[01:31:55] that they were promised. Like lots and\n[01:31:57] lots and lots of different reasons, but\n[01:31:59] one of the big ones culturally, which is\n[01:32:01] really fascinating, is K-pop. K-pop was\n[01:32:04] this export that Korea was going to put\n[01:32:06] to the world. We have this ability to\n[01:32:09] construct like the perfect boy band or\n[01:32:11] girl band. we're going to export it to\n[01:32:13] the world and this is going to be a\n[01:32:14] representation for us. One of the things\n[01:32:15] that K-pop stars have to say is that\n[01:32:17] they will be celibate while they're in\n[01:32:19] the band. So, not only does this mean\n[01:32:20] that they can't be in a relationship, so\n[01:32:22] the most popular cultural influences in\n[01:32:25] South Korea aren't showing a pro-\n[01:32:28] relationship narrative.\n[01:32:30] >> They also obviously can't be mothers or\n[01:32:33] fathers because they can't be in a\n[01:32:34] relationship. the converse of this\n[01:32:37] cultural intervention in the country of\n[01:32:38] Georgia, very religious and there's this\n[01:32:41] superstar pastor guy, very religious\n[01:32:44] country, this this this pastor that's\n[01:32:46] kind of like a really rock star sort of\n[01:32:49] dude.\n[01:32:51] He said, \"I will personally baptize the\n[01:32:54] third child of any family in the\n[01:32:57] country.\" So now these parents are\n[01:32:59] speedrunning having kids so that their\n[01:33:01] child can be baptized by the equivalent\n[01:33:03] like you know the goat. He's like the\n[01:33:04] the the the like [ __ ] Avichi of uh of\n[01:33:08] of of pastas.\n[01:33:13] K-pop did the exact opposite. They had a\n[01:33:16] cultural intervention which showed a\n[01:33:18] nonp pro- family influence whereas\n[01:33:22] Georgia had this one that was a pro-\n[01:33:23] family influence. So, a cultural\n[01:33:25] intervention that South Korea could\n[01:33:27] easily implement would be to say the\n[01:33:29] only way that you can become a K-pop\n[01:33:31] star is to already have had a kid. Like,\n[01:33:35] we're only going to create boy bands and\n[01:33:37] girl bands out of people who have\n[01:33:39] already had families.\n[01:33:41] >> This kind of brings the conversation to\n[01:33:42] me and you because there's a lot of men\n[01:33:44] that listen to your show. There's a lot\n[01:33:45] of men that listen to my show. And I do\n[01:33:47] think in many respects we're modeling to\n[01:33:49] some respects to some people what it is\n[01:33:51] to be a good man.\n[01:33:54] by what we choose to do. You know, you\n[01:33:55] have a lot of influence. I've watched\n[01:33:56] the videos of people coming to you after\n[01:33:57] after your tours and they say to you\n[01:33:59] that you're their friend. They're like\n[01:34:00] they thank you for the fact that you\n[01:34:01] have been their their big brother or\n[01:34:02] their friend to look up to. And so I I\n[01:34:04] think about this a lot which is like\n[01:34:06] what am I modeling\n[01:34:07] >> as a as a podcaster? We're both in the\n[01:34:09] top 10 list of the global podcasts uh\n[01:34:12] according to Spotify. So do you think\n[01:34:14] about what you you model and do you\n[01:34:16] think about what a good man is? Do you\n[01:34:17] think about what you want your audience\n[01:34:19] to think of a man's responsibility is?\n[01:34:22] >> Yeah, very much so. That being said,\n[01:34:24] I've never claimed to be some shining\n[01:34:26] example of what people should do.\n[01:34:28] >> Uh I certainly know that I try my best\n[01:34:33] to\n[01:34:35] be the sort of guy that I would want to\n[01:34:39] be friends with. I I quite like me. I\n[01:34:42] quite like me. And I've worked really\n[01:34:44] hard. I didn't like me. And I worked\n[01:34:46] really, really hard to form myself into\n[01:34:48] a shape, a construction.\n[01:34:50] I feel big emotions, for instance. And\n[01:34:53] for a long time I was very ashamed of\n[01:34:54] them and I wouldn't get below the neck\n[01:34:55] and I would use intellect to like\n[01:34:58] protect myself from feeling my feelings.\n[01:35:00] And on stage anybody that's come to see\n[01:35:02] my live show I get tearary every night.\n[01:35:04] I get tearary telling the same story.\n[01:35:07] Okay. Well, I think that's like a a good\n[01:35:11] thing. I think it's a good thing for\n[01:35:13] guys who feel their emotions to show\n[01:35:15] that they feel their emotions. Right.\n[01:35:17] Suppression isn't the same thing as\n[01:35:19] strength.\n[01:35:20] and I've stopped suppressing. Wonderful.\n[01:35:24] I think that there is uh wonderful\n[01:35:28] upside in trying to conquer and trying\n[01:35:31] to achieve mastery, trying to really\n[01:35:32] drive yourself to go and do stuff. But\n[01:35:34] I'm not like [ __ ] your feelings, just\n[01:35:36] hustle and grind until your eyes bleed\n[01:35:38] either. So, I'm trying to show balance.\n[01:35:40] I think mindfulness is really important.\n[01:35:41] I think that a physical practice is\n[01:35:43] really important. All of this stuff kind\n[01:35:44] of appears in the exterior. Remember\n[01:35:47] what I said before? What's the\n[01:35:48] conversation we're prepared to have?\n[01:35:49] What's the one thing that you should be\n[01:35:51] doing? It's usually the big thing. The\n[01:35:52] big thing is probably going to be\n[01:35:54] something to do with have a [ __ ]\n[01:35:55] family, dude. Like, it's time for you to\n[01:35:57] have a family, but it's a uh\n[01:36:00] >> Is that scary for you? Be honest.\n[01:36:03] >> To have a family? No.\n[01:36:04] >> But the the sacrifice and commitment\n[01:36:06] >> It used to be.\n[01:36:07] >> It used to be.\n[01:36:08] >> Used to be. Yeah. Of course.\n[01:36:09] >> When did that change?\n[01:36:11] >> Two years ago.\n[01:36:12] >> Really?\n[01:36:12] >> Two or three years ago? Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:36:13] Yeah. And again, we are products of our\n[01:36:16] environment. like all of the the\n[01:36:20] cornucopia of different things that we\n[01:36:22] can do. Look at this paniply of options\n[01:36:24] that I could spend my life doing. And\n[01:36:26] you sort of get shiny object syndrome\n[01:36:28] and you chase after things and isn't it\n[01:36:30] going to be exciting and then you get to\n[01:36:35] where you thought you wanted to be and\n[01:36:37] you go\n[01:36:38] that might not be the answer.\n[01:36:41] That's why\n[01:36:43] having a bit of time to reflect, having\n[01:36:44] a little bit of time for quiet, fleeting\n[01:36:47] thoughts to come up. Like a busy\n[01:36:49] calendar is a hedge against existential\n[01:36:51] loneliness. Right? If you are always\n[01:36:53] needed by somebody, you don't have to\n[01:36:55] sit with your quiet thoughts. You don't\n[01:36:57] have to think, \"Oh, [ __ ] that deep\n[01:37:00] question that's been in the back of my\n[01:37:02] mind. I'm it's easy to push off if\n[01:37:03] people want me or I move from\n[01:37:05] caffeinefueled meeting to evening\n[01:37:07] dinner. I actually have to listen to\n[01:37:09] that.\" But if you sit with your thoughts\n[01:37:11] for a little bit, and this is why a lot\n[01:37:12] of people don't like sitting with their\n[01:37:13] thoughts, this stuff comes up. And\n[01:37:16] that's why the question, \"What emotions\n[01:37:17] are you unprepared to feel?\" is so good.\n[01:37:19] >> What changed two years ago that made you\n[01:37:21] change your perspective?\n[01:37:22] >> I don't know. I grew up. I just I guess\n[01:37:25] that's what growing up is called. Like\n[01:37:27] it wasn't some moment where the skies\n[01:37:30] opened and and things changed. I noticed\n[01:37:32] I used to think I used to think that\n[01:37:34] kids were super annoying. My business\n[01:37:36] partner uh had his first son when he was\n[01:37:39] 25. So I would have been 252, 25, 26\n[01:37:41] maybe. And I remember thinking, [ __ ]\n[01:37:44] like he just can't come out with me\n[01:37:45] anymore. Like he's busy. He's got all\n[01:37:47] this stuff to do. And then each kid that\n[01:37:50] he had, it was about two years apart,\n[01:37:52] each one. I noticed my relationship to\n[01:37:55] the child was different. I was like,\n[01:37:57] \"Oh, okay. Well, you know, they're kind\n[01:37:59] of kind of cute or whatever.\" And then\n[01:38:01] another one came along and I'm like,\n[01:38:02] \"Okay, like that's really.\" So, I saw\n[01:38:04] this sort of um sedimentary rock, this\n[01:38:06] like archaeological dig of myself\n[01:38:08] change, and now I'm godfather to uh my\n[01:38:12] best friend's daughter, beautiful\n[01:38:13] daughter who's like four months old, 5\n[01:38:15] months old. And I love going around and\n[01:38:16] seeing her. And yeah, I I don't know.\n[01:38:18] It's just growing up, dude. Growing up's\n[01:38:20] weird because something changes and you\n[01:38:23] kind of didn't choose it. Do you know\n[01:38:25] what I mean? Like, did you choose?\n[01:38:26] >> No. [ __ ] me. No, it's weird, man. It's\n[01:38:29] weird.\n[01:38:29] >> This belief climbs inside of you and\n[01:38:31] sort of wears you a little bit.\n[01:38:33] >> Yeah. And a lot of the time we're scared\n[01:38:35] of that and I understand why. But like\n[01:38:37] resisting the fact that that's there\n[01:38:40] like\n[01:38:42] I don't know it's kind of a denial of\n[01:38:43] this beautiful thing that's just been\n[01:38:45] given to you. There you go. There's like\n[01:38:46] something new and exciting that you can\n[01:38:48] move into. And I think a lot of friction\n[01:38:51] is in the resistance, right? Suffering\n[01:38:53] is in the resistance of the thing.\n[01:38:56] >> I've just finished writing my third\n[01:38:57] book. I haven't firmed up the title yet,\n[01:38:59] but I have started mocking up some\n[01:39:01] different designs. And I've been doing\n[01:39:03] this with Adobe Express, which is one of\n[01:39:05] our sponsors. What I love about Adobe\n[01:39:06] Express is that it makes it so easy for\n[01:39:08] me to obsess over the tiniest details.\n[01:39:10] The typography, the font, the color, the\n[01:39:12] text placement, the stuff that might\n[01:39:14] sound petty to most people, but actually\n[01:39:16] compounds to create something that\n[01:39:18] stands out, something that's one better\n[01:39:21] than the rest. And designing my cover\n[01:39:22] art has reminded me of how many creative\n[01:39:24] things I've learned over the year. But\n[01:39:26] it's also reminded me that there are so\n[01:39:27] many creative minds around me that are\n[01:39:29] also sitting on their own secrets. So\n[01:39:31] I've created the one better guide in\n[01:39:34] Adobe Express to bring those tips to\n[01:39:36] you. And in it, you'll find principles\n[01:39:37] from the very, very best in their\n[01:39:39] industry turned into quick and easy\n[01:39:41] practices for you to apply so you can\n[01:39:43] train yourself to create exactly like\n[01:39:45] the best performing teams in the world\n[01:39:46] do. Just head over to adobe.wet\n[01:39:50] to download Adobe Express now. And make\n[01:39:52] sure you visit the learn tab to discover\n[01:39:55] how you can become one better than the\n[01:39:57] rest. You know, every once in a while\n[01:39:59] you come across a product that has such\n[01:40:01] a huge impact on your life that you'd\n[01:40:03] probably describe as a gamecher. And I\n[01:40:07] would say for about 35 to 40% of my\n[01:40:11] team, they would currently describe this\n[01:40:13] product that I have in front of me\n[01:40:15] called Ketone IQ, which you can get at\n[01:40:17] ketone.com\n[01:40:19] as a game changer. But the reason I\n[01:40:21] became a coowner of this company and the\n[01:40:22] reason why they they now are a sponsor\n[01:40:23] of this podcast is because one day when\n[01:40:26] I came to work there was a box of this\n[01:40:27] stuff sat on my desk. I had no idea what\n[01:40:29] it was. Lily in my team says that this\n[01:40:31] company have been in touch. So I went\n[01:40:33] upstairs tried it and quite frankly the\n[01:40:35] rest is history in terms of my focus, my\n[01:40:38] energy levels, how I feel, how I work,\n[01:40:40] how productive I am. Game changer. So if\n[01:40:43] you want to give it a try, visit\n[01:40:44] ketone.com/stephven\n[01:40:45] for 30% off. You'll also get a free gift\n[01:40:48] with your second shipment and now you\n[01:40:50] can find Keton IQ at Target stores\n[01:40:52] across the United States where your\n[01:40:54] first shot is completely free of charge.\n[01:40:57] You mentioned a word earlier on. You\n[01:40:59] talked about the lonely chapter.\n[01:41:01] >> Uhhuh.\n[01:41:02] >> You you said the word briefly. I guess\n[01:41:04] this lonely chapter idea is a\n[01:41:06] consequence of what will happen when you\n[01:41:08] go in pursuit of a big goal. You want to\n[01:41:10] start the business. You want to quit the\n[01:41:11] job. Whatever. Explain to me what the\n[01:41:13] lonely chapter is. The lonely chapter\n[01:41:15] describes a time in your life where\n[01:41:17] you're so developed that you can't\n[01:41:20] really resonate with your old set of\n[01:41:21] friends, but you're not yet sufficiently\n[01:41:23] developed that you've built a new set of\n[01:41:24] friends.\n[01:41:25] >> Give me an example.\n[01:41:26] >> You have decided to stop drinking. Your\n[01:41:28] New Year's resolution is 6 months. I'm\n[01:41:30] going to stop drinking. You can go out\n[01:41:34] with your friends that want to go to the\n[01:41:35] pub on an evening time, but you feel a\n[01:41:37] little bit ostracized. They're having\n[01:41:38] digs at you and jibes at you. Oh, come\n[01:41:40] on, mate. Only one beer. Who do you\n[01:41:42] think you are?\n[01:41:43] Um, so your change is creating some\n[01:41:47] friction between you and them. Your\n[01:41:49] friends like to play Xbox on an evening\n[01:41:52] time and that's how they hang out, but\n[01:41:54] you want to start going to the gym, but\n[01:41:56] your friends don't go to the gym and\n[01:41:58] then when you do hang out with them,\n[01:41:59] you're talking about the gym because\n[01:42:00] that's your new thing and they're still\n[01:42:02] talking about Xbox. So there is a a\n[01:42:05] friction that happens as you try to grow\n[01:42:09] because if your friends don't grow at\n[01:42:10] the same pace as you, you don't speak\n[01:42:12] the same language. A friend referred to\n[01:42:14] it as changing your dialect so much so\n[01:42:16] that over time you and your friends\n[01:42:18] don't even speak the same language\n[01:42:19] anymore.\n[01:42:21] >> And it's very uncomfortable because it's\n[01:42:22] tempting to go back to the old life that\n[01:42:24] you're used to. The old patterns, the\n[01:42:27] old routines, the old friend groups, the\n[01:42:29] old everything. And you have to stop\n[01:42:31] doing the things that you know bring you\n[01:42:33] validation in the moment to start doing\n[01:42:36] the things that you have no idea about\n[01:42:39] whether it'll actually work. Like you're\n[01:42:41] going to tell me that I'm not going to\n[01:42:43] go out with my friends this weekend cuz\n[01:42:45] I'm going to keep my meditation streak\n[01:42:47] going. Who even knows if meditation\n[01:42:48] works, right? It's so much easier to\n[01:42:50] just stay in the routine that you were\n[01:42:52] previously doing the same sort of\n[01:42:53] things. for you to pull away from that,\n[01:42:55] you're going to have to do stuff usually\n[01:42:57] that makes you more different, more easy\n[01:42:59] to be mocked, and more alone.\n[01:43:02] And the initial sad reality is that on\n[01:43:07] your journey of personal growth, at some\n[01:43:09] point you may need to leave a group of\n[01:43:11] friends behind who aren't growing at the\n[01:43:13] same pace as you.\n[01:43:15] But the really sad reality is that if\n[01:43:17] you do it a lot, you may have to do this\n[01:43:20] multiple times throughout your life. And\n[01:43:23] it's not a value judgment about who's\n[01:43:24] better or who's worse. It's just a stark\n[01:43:26] reality of what happens when you start\n[01:43:28] to make changes in your life. And I for\n[01:43:31] instance, I met a million people on the\n[01:43:32] front door of nightclubs. Million people\n[01:43:34] in person had a handful of friends. I\n[01:43:36] worked with half of them. Million\n[01:43:38] people, handful of friends in internet\n[01:43:40] marketing speak. My friendship\n[01:43:41] conversion funnel ratio was not very\n[01:43:43] good. Million people, handful of\n[01:43:44] friends. And the only way that I could\n[01:43:47] work out who I was was to kind of follow\n[01:43:49] my own instincts and do some of the\n[01:43:51] personal development stuff. Like a\n[01:43:53] thousand days sober, 500 days without\n[01:43:55] caffeine, which is [ __ ] miserable.\n[01:43:57] Nine gratitude meditation journals with\n[01:44:00] no idea if any of it was going to work.\n[01:44:02] And this is the really important thing,\n[01:44:04] and it's a bit that all origin stories\n[01:44:08] miss. And I I wish that they paid more\n[01:44:10] attention to it.\n[01:44:12] Seems to me that on every hero's\n[01:44:15] journey, as soon as they make the\n[01:44:17] commitment to go from where they are to\n[01:44:19] where they want to be, their self-belief\n[01:44:21] never waver. Like, sure, there's ups and\n[01:44:24] downs in the journey and the progress,\n[01:44:27] but their conviction doesn't slip. It's\n[01:44:30] like at that moment, the clouds parted\n[01:44:32] and I was sure I was going to become a\n[01:44:33] UFC fighter. I was going to become a\n[01:44:34] businessman. I was going to get off\n[01:44:35] drugs, change my mindset, whatever. In\n[01:44:38] my experience, that's not the way it is\n[01:44:42] at all. Like your entire journey of\n[01:44:47] personal growth is just steeped in doubt\n[01:44:50] and self-pity and uncertainty and it\n[01:44:52] tarnishes the whole experience. It's not\n[01:44:54] sexy. It's not cool. You're like, \"This\n[01:44:57] is supposed to be my rocky cut scene.\n[01:44:59] It's three and a half minutes in the\n[01:45:00] movies, but it's been four years for me.\n[01:45:02] What's going on?\" There's not even the\n[01:45:04] promise that there's any glory on the\n[01:45:06] other side of it. And this\n[01:45:09] is exactly why it's so much easier to\n[01:45:11] just go back to your old patterns. Why\n[01:45:14] it's easier to just go back to doing the\n[01:45:15] old things that you used to do. People\n[01:45:17] make small changes. They do little\n[01:45:18] things. Lose 5 pounds or they change\n[01:45:22] companies. But how many people do you\n[01:45:23] know that have really changed their\n[01:45:25] mindset? Lost 50 or 100 pounds or change\n[01:45:27] careers or moved from the city that they\n[01:45:29] grew up in? It's rarer. And I think the\n[01:45:33] reason that I love this lonely chapter\n[01:45:35] idea is that it it names something that\n[01:45:40] a lot of people feel is a bug, not a\n[01:45:43] feature of personal growth, which is\n[01:45:45] this discordance with their old patterns\n[01:45:47] and their old friend groups and the fact\n[01:45:48] that they don't know whether the\n[01:45:51] uncomfortability is supposed to be\n[01:45:52] there. Is this discomfort right? Is my\n[01:45:54] self-doubt? Surely I should just believe\n[01:45:56] and see it, believe it, achieve it. Am I\n[01:45:57] not supposed to just be, you know,\n[01:46:00] single-mindedly going toward my goal?\n[01:46:03] This doubt is supposed to be there. I I\n[01:46:05] can promise you that every single person\n[01:46:08] who has gone from a place where they\n[01:46:09] didn't want to be to one where they did\n[01:46:12] has had to go through this lonely\n[01:46:14] chapter and deal with all of this. And\n[01:46:18] uh I think it resonates with people\n[01:46:21] because the sort of people who listen to\n[01:46:23] Modern Wisdom and your show are the sort\n[01:46:26] of people that this is about. It's the\n[01:46:29] kind of people who live in the UK and\n[01:46:31] want to do something themselves\n[01:46:34] who want to build a business, do\n[01:46:36] something that there isn't a\n[01:46:37] particularly good role model for. That's\n[01:46:39] presumably because they want to do\n[01:46:41] something. They want to become better.\n[01:46:42] They feel like they're built for more.\n[01:46:44] Uh, and this is what I meant when I said\n[01:46:46] before that you can just do things. Just\n[01:46:49] do it anyway. Do it tired,\n[01:46:52] do it sad, do it lonely, do it without a\n[01:46:54] role model because if you're waiting for\n[01:46:57] somebody to come along and give you that\n[01:46:58] helping hand, sometimes you're going to\n[01:47:00] be waiting too long.\n[01:47:02] >> It reminds me so much of um Jeff Bezos's\n[01:47:06] shareholder letter where he talks about\n[01:47:07] resisting the equilibrium. in his final\n[01:47:11] 2020 sharehold shareholder letter said,\n[01:47:13] \"Differentiation is survival and the\n[01:47:15] universe wants you to be typical.\" And\n[01:47:17] the way that this dubtails into what\n[01:47:18] you've said is your environment is very\n[01:47:20] very much holding you in place. And\n[01:47:23] actually in every facet of life, every\n[01:47:26] organism is currently expending a huge\n[01:47:29] amount of energy just to resist the pull\n[01:47:32] to be typical\n[01:47:32] >> regression to the mean.\n[01:47:33] >> Exactly. So if you were to like leave\n[01:47:35] your friendship group now, the the\n[01:47:37] amount of energy it's going to take to\n[01:47:39] stay untypical is tremendous. And he\n[01:47:41] says, \"This is my last annual\n[01:47:42] shareholder letter as the CEO of Amazon,\n[01:47:45] >> and I have one last thing of utmost\n[01:47:47] importance I feel compelled to teach. I\n[01:47:50] hope all Amazonians take it to heart.\n[01:47:52] Here is a passage from Richard Dawkins\n[01:47:54] book, The Blind Watchmaker. It's about a\n[01:47:56] basic fact of biology. Saving off death\n[01:47:59] is a thing that you have to work at.\n[01:48:00] Left to itself and that is what it is\n[01:48:03] when it dies. The body tends to revert\n[01:48:06] to a state of equilibrium with its\n[01:48:07] environment. If you measure some\n[01:48:09] quantity such as the temperature, the\n[01:48:11] acidity, the water content or the\n[01:48:12] electrical potential of a living body,\n[01:48:14] you will typically find that it is\n[01:48:16] markedly different from the\n[01:48:18] corresponding measure in its\n[01:48:19] surroundings. Our bodies, for instance,\n[01:48:22] are usually hotter than our\n[01:48:23] surroundings. And in cold climates, they\n[01:48:25] have to work hard to maintain that\n[01:48:27] differential. When we die, the work\n[01:48:29] stops. The temp temperature differential\n[01:48:31] starts to disappear and we end up the\n[01:48:33] same temperature as our surroundings.\n[01:48:35] Not all animals have to work so hard to\n[01:48:38] avoid coming into equilibrium with their\n[01:48:40] surrounding temperature. But all animals\n[01:48:42] do some comparable work. For instance,\n[01:48:44] in a dry country, animals and plants\n[01:48:46] work to maintain the fluid content in\n[01:48:48] their cells. They work against a natural\n[01:48:50] tendency for water to flow from them\n[01:48:52] into the dry outside world. If they\n[01:48:54] fail, they die. More generally, if\n[01:48:56] living things didn't work actively to\n[01:48:58] prevent it, they would eventually merge\n[01:49:00] into their surroundings and cease to\n[01:49:02] exist as autonomous beings. This is what\n[01:49:04] happens when they die. And what he's\n[01:49:06] talking about here is that to be\n[01:49:07] different in any context or environment,\n[01:49:10] work is being done. Like to stay\n[01:49:12] atypical, and I think about this as we\n[01:49:14] come into the new year, which is if\n[01:49:15] you're planning to be different, quit\n[01:49:17] the job, go and be the violinist in\n[01:49:18] Peru, start the cupcake business. It's\n[01:49:21] going to cost you so much energy to\n[01:49:23] resist the equilibrium that you better\n[01:49:25] going back to what you said about\n[01:49:27] subtracting things. You better save\n[01:49:28] energy somewhere else\n[01:49:30] >> because\n[01:49:31] you know I had a neuroscientist on the\n[01:49:33] podcast that was the neuroscientist that\n[01:49:35] discovered we have a biological budget\n[01:49:37] of energy and literally like a bank\n[01:49:39] account. And what tends to happen, I\n[01:49:41] think, and why the the New Year stats\n[01:49:42] are so horrific in terms of the amount\n[01:49:44] of people that stick to their goals is\n[01:49:46] we go in search of\n[01:49:48] a new state, a new life that's going to\n[01:49:51] cost us even more energy to resist the\n[01:49:54] our current environment without\n[01:49:56] budgeting for it by saving elsewhere.\n[01:49:59] And I think about this through the lens\n[01:50:01] of as a business owner because as a\n[01:50:03] company the dire of a co will become\n[01:50:05] like the mean the minute we stop the\n[01:50:07] fight.\n[01:50:07] >> The minute we stop experimenting the\n[01:50:09] minute we stop pushing the boundaries.\n[01:50:10] The minute you stop doing the big\n[01:50:11] digital screens the minute you give up\n[01:50:13] the fight you will become every other\n[01:50:16] show. That's what I meant when I said\n[01:50:17] problems are a feature of life not a\n[01:50:19] bug. Like there will be no day when you\n[01:50:22] don't have any problems. And uh railing\n[01:50:26] against it. Why is the flight delayed?\n[01:50:28] Because flights get delayed. Because\n[01:50:30] flights get delayed. That's why. And did\n[01:50:32] you think that there was going to be a\n[01:50:34] day when no flights were delayed? That\n[01:50:36] you're going to reach some escape\n[01:50:37] velocity where this was no longer an\n[01:50:39] issue? I love this analogy using escape\n[01:50:41] velocity. Imagine that we've got a uh\n[01:50:43] rocket ship here. So when this is taking\n[01:50:47] off on the launch pad is when it needs\n[01:50:48] the most energy. The inertia is the\n[01:50:50] highest, the resistance is the most. So\n[01:50:52] that's when you need to use whatever\n[01:50:53] fuel you've got. Use the chip on your\n[01:50:55] shoulder from the kids that bullied you\n[01:50:56] in school. Use your desperate desire to\n[01:50:58] be seen by that girl out there. Use your\n[01:51:02] need for validation from your parents,\n[01:51:04] whatever it is. And then what happens is\n[01:51:06] the old school style rockets, not the\n[01:51:07] new Falcon 9 ones. What happens when\n[01:51:09] this takes off?\n[01:51:11] This fuel source switches off and then\n[01:51:13] the booster rockets come on. That's as\n[01:51:15] you get to a different level of altitude\n[01:51:17] and now you're using a different sort of\n[01:51:18] fuel source and then this falls away,\n[01:51:21] the bottom falls off and it keeps on\n[01:51:23] going and then it gets into escape\n[01:51:25] velocity. Use what you have at the\n[01:51:27] start. And at the start, most people\n[01:51:28] have way more discontent than they do\n[01:51:30] love.\n[01:51:30] >> There's a I mean, even this ties right\n[01:51:32] back to New Year's resolutions because\n[01:51:34] if I am going to make a change and reach\n[01:51:36] escape velocity, then I'm going to need\n[01:51:38] to focus all my energy and therefore\n[01:51:40] save leakage, like save wasted energy in\n[01:51:43] this moment of time. And I've heard you\n[01:51:44] talk about this when you do your annual\n[01:51:46] review that again it goes back to what\n[01:51:48] we're saying like you do need to cut\n[01:51:50] some [ __ ] and you can't have it all at\n[01:51:52] the same time if you are going to change\n[01:51:54] your life.\n[01:51:56] This is one of the problems of\n[01:51:57] overcooking your goals for the next 12\n[01:51:59] months. I think you can probably do two\n[01:52:02] big things in 2026. Two big things. You\n[01:52:06] can probably lose 20 pounds and get a\n[01:52:10] boyfriend that you really, really love.\n[01:52:14] You can't do that and move cities and\n[01:52:16] start a new business and and learn to\n[01:52:18] play the piano. No. And that again is\n[01:52:21] why don't go into a buffet and assume\n[01:52:24] that however much food you put on the\n[01:52:26] plate, your stomach will just expand to\n[01:52:28] fit it in. Because what you're going to\n[01:52:30] guarantee is that you fail next year.\n[01:52:33] You can almost guarantee that you fail\n[01:52:34] at doing this thing. Is it great to set\n[01:52:36] your sights high? Yeah, that's real\n[01:52:37] cool. And maybe you've got lots of\n[01:52:38] things that you want to do, but just\n[01:52:40] what would have to happen by the end of\n[01:52:41] next year for you to look back on it and\n[01:52:43] consider it a success. And what if you\n[01:52:45] created a rankordered list and okay, I\n[01:52:47] need to kill one of these and you left\n[01:52:49] yourself with one or two. What's left?\n[01:52:50] You could only do one thing next year.\n[01:52:53] Cross that off. Cross that off. Cross\n[01:52:54] that. What am I left with?\n[01:52:57] I really want to lose the weight. There\n[01:52:59] we go. Now we can break that down into\n[01:53:00] individual steps. I need to get a gym\n[01:53:02] membership. I need to get some cool gym\n[01:53:03] wear that makes me feel good as I go to\n[01:53:04] the gym.\n[01:53:06] I've heard you talk, you know, you\n[01:53:07] mentioned that get getting a boyfriend\n[01:53:08] next year. One of the resolutions a lot\n[01:53:10] of people will have, even if it's not\n[01:53:12] directly, is to find a partner.\n[01:53:15] >> And I I heard you referencing\n[01:53:17] psychological stability as the thing we\n[01:53:20] should be looking for in a partner.\n[01:53:22] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:53:23] >> What do you mean by psychological\n[01:53:25] stability?\n[01:53:26] >> After some sort of emotional\n[01:53:27] perturbment, after something happens,\n[01:53:30] how long does it take for them to get\n[01:53:31] back to baseline?\n[01:53:32] >> Oh, okay. So, I'm looking for someone\n[01:53:34] who is just what? emotionally stable or\n[01:53:36] they they returned\n[01:53:38] >> the return to their emotional\n[01:53:39] equilibrium. Right? So, let's say that\n[01:53:41] we're going on holiday and uh the flight\n[01:53:45] is cancelled and it's a big deal because\n[01:53:48] their family is going out there. Is that\n[01:53:50] the sort of thing that happens and then\n[01:53:52] there is a reversion to baseline within\n[01:53:55] a few hours or is that the sort of thing\n[01:53:57] that blows up the entire trip of the\n[01:53:59] holiday with their family? M\n[01:54:02] >> something occurs that causes emotions to\n[01:54:04] be uh impacted. How long does it take to\n[01:54:07] get back to baseline? That's emotional\n[01:54:09] stability and it's very predictive of\n[01:54:12] relationship outcomes. Some other stuff\n[01:54:14] um conscientiousness.\n[01:54:16] Person's thoughtful. They think a lot\n[01:54:19] about you specifically and they care.\n[01:54:23] Agreeableness. Someone who's moderately\n[01:54:24] agreeable. You want somebody who when\n[01:54:27] you propose plans is a a yes and person\n[01:54:31] like huh yeah\n[01:54:34] and finally you want someone who's\n[01:54:36] moderately open in openness personality\n[01:54:40] trait. So there's three\n[01:54:42] conscientiousness agreeableness openness\n[01:54:44] to experience. You want someone who's\n[01:54:46] moderately open so that they're prepared\n[01:54:48] to go and do new things. As soon as you\n[01:54:49] get into high openness that's when\n[01:54:51] wandering eyes come in. This isn't to\n[01:54:53] say that personality traits are destiny,\n[01:54:56] rah,\n[01:54:57] but based on titro's work, this is\n[01:55:01] pretty reliable. I also like the\n[01:55:02] psychological stability thing. I think\n[01:55:04] that's really, really lovely. You want\n[01:55:06] somebody who feels like home. You want a\n[01:55:08] relationship that feels like a safe\n[01:55:10] harbor that you can wall yourself off\n[01:55:12] against all of the ills of the world.\n[01:55:14] Your business can fall apart. Your\n[01:55:16] health can decay. Your friends can\n[01:55:18] abandon you.\n[01:55:20] But you know that at home there's\n[01:55:22] someone who loves you for who you are,\n[01:55:24] not for what you do, and they've always\n[01:55:26] got your back. And I think\n[01:55:29] aiming for a relationship that feels\n[01:55:31] like a safe harbor is a really good\n[01:55:34] idea.\n[01:55:35] >> It's rough at the moment, isn't it? For\n[01:55:36] I just I just I'm so glad that I'm not\n[01:55:38] single because when I look out at the\n[01:55:40] dating landscape of like dating apps and\n[01:55:42] all this stuff, I'm so glad that I I'm\n[01:55:45] not out there in in that war zone. Mhm.\n[01:55:48] >> And when you, you know, there's a lot of\n[01:55:50] single people that follow you, men and\n[01:55:52] women. When you think about if you were\n[01:55:56] 30-year-old Chris, and you're a single\n[01:55:58] guy, you're not doing the podcast,\n[01:55:59] people don't know who you are.\n[01:56:01] >> If you were trying to solve the love\n[01:56:02] problem in your life, where would you\n[01:56:03] aim at first?\n[01:56:04] >> Like the love problem, that's cool. Um,\n[01:56:07] the first thing you need to do is say,\n[01:56:08] am I the sort of person who the sort of\n[01:56:11] person I want to date wants to date?\n[01:56:15] >> Yeah. If not, it's obvious where you\n[01:56:17] need to work. Work on yourself.\n[01:56:19] >> That's such an important question that\n[01:56:21] requires such honesty.\n[01:56:22] >> Yeah. And this again is why some time\n[01:56:24] away from the urgent in the importance,\n[01:56:26] some time to reflect, some time to\n[01:56:27] listen to your fleeting thoughts. You\n[01:56:29] know, you know that your wardrobe sucks.\n[01:56:32] You know that your wardrobe sucks and\n[01:56:33] you hate fashion and you've excused it.\n[01:56:35] It's like, I don't need to do that or\n[01:56:37] I'm not interested or whatever.\n[01:56:39] Hey, dude. I'm sorry.\n[01:56:41] Chicks care about how you look. Shock\n[01:56:43] horror. They care about what you wear.\n[01:56:45] probably need to go and update the\n[01:56:46] wardrobe. You got a female friend. You\n[01:56:48] watch a few YouTube videos online. Maybe\n[01:56:50] that's where you need to start. I'm a\n[01:56:52] bit overweight. I'm a bit skinny fat.\n[01:56:55] The gym is one of the most reliable ways\n[01:56:57] to increase your attractiveness. One of\n[01:56:58] the most reliable ways as a man to\n[01:57:00] increase your attractiveness. You need\n[01:57:02] to be a real super Chad to not need to\n[01:57:04] have any physical practice at all and\n[01:57:06] still be able to get the sort of woman\n[01:57:08] that you want. So, okay, maybe you're\n[01:57:10] going to start to go to the gym, but\n[01:57:12] let's assume that you have reached the\n[01:57:14] level that you need to be at in order to\n[01:57:18] be attractive to the sort of person that\n[01:57:19] you are. So, that's the first one,\n[01:57:20] right? Because if you're not, you're\n[01:57:21] permanently uh condemning yourself to\n[01:57:24] always pine after partners that aren't\n[01:57:26] going to want you back. Next step, where\n[01:57:29] do partners like the sort of person that\n[01:57:32] you want to date hang out? Where do they\n[01:57:35] go? Like if you love dance music, it's\n[01:57:39] probably a bad idea to go to a breath\n[01:57:40] work class. Like why not just go to\n[01:57:42] parties that have got dance DJs on? Or\n[01:57:44] if you're really into lectures and\n[01:57:46] philosophy, go to an Alex Okconor live\n[01:57:48] event or something and hang around\n[01:57:50] outside or like talk to the girl that's\n[01:57:51] next to you. If you really love sport,\n[01:57:54] like obviously go to the gym, pick up\n[01:57:56] pickle ball, like start doing that.\n[01:57:58] Where are the sorts of places inhabited\n[01:58:00] by the sort of person that you want to\n[01:58:02] be like? There's bonus points if you can\n[01:58:05] go and do a thing that you have a little\n[01:58:07] bit of a competitive advantage at,\n[01:58:08] especially as a guy. If you used to play\n[01:58:11] tennis in high school and you've got a\n[01:58:14] bit of hand eye coordination, you can\n[01:58:15] probably be one of the best pickle ball\n[01:58:17] players at a recreational court pretty\n[01:58:18] quickly and you're going to be that new\n[01:58:20] guy who's like a like you seem like I\n[01:58:21] want to play with him like he always\n[01:58:22] wins or whatever it might be. Like not\n[01:58:24] being manipulative, you're just playing\n[01:58:26] to your strengths.\n[01:58:27] >> What decision did you make in your life\n[01:58:28] that made you more attractive than any\n[01:58:30] other decision? going to the gym. Going\n[01:58:33] to the gym. Uh I started training when I\n[01:58:36] was 18 at the Center for Sporting\n[01:58:38] Excellence at Newcastle University. I\n[01:58:39] had no idea what I was doing and was\n[01:58:41] taking blueberry extract and unflavored\n[01:58:44] hydraized whey in a desperate attempt to\n[01:58:46] see if I could gain some size and I just\n[01:58:48] didn't stop. And um\n[01:58:51] I like it. It makes me healthier. It\n[01:58:53] makes me feel powerful. It it it added\n[01:58:56] to my frame. I had real hard gain. It\n[01:58:58] took [ __ ] ages to put weight. I\n[01:59:00] remember when I was 20 and I broke 70\n[01:59:04] kilos for the first time and I was like,\n[01:59:05] I'm [ __ ] huge. Um, and I just didn't\n[01:59:08] stop. And I think not only is it\n[01:59:11] something that's great for me, it's\n[01:59:12] something that really very reliably\n[01:59:15] makes you more attractive to women.\n[01:59:16] >> What about for women?\n[01:59:18] >> What do you think in your POV would\n[01:59:20] make?\n[01:59:22] >> Look, I would be tempted to go for the\n[01:59:23] gym thing too. And the reason that I\n[01:59:25] like it is that it is it's\n[01:59:28] uh you benefit on multiple levels. Like\n[01:59:31] even what you don't want to do is do\n[01:59:33] something that makes your life feel like\n[01:59:34] a performance for your future partner.\n[01:59:37] >> You want something that even if that\n[01:59:38] doesn't come along, you're still glad\n[01:59:39] you did it. And how many people say, \"I\n[01:59:42] went to the gym in an attempt to get\n[01:59:43] better legs because the guy that I want\n[01:59:45] to attract is kind of like into girls\n[01:59:46] that have got good legs and I want to\n[01:59:47] wear like nice dresses and look cute in\n[01:59:49] them and all the rest of it.\" But I\n[01:59:51] really hated the way that I my boyfriend\n[01:59:54] didn't come along and what I was I broke\n[01:59:56] myself trying to do I lost myself trying\n[01:59:58] to do that. No, you made yourself. You\n[02:00:01] won independently of whether or not that\n[02:00:04] person came along. And how wonderful is\n[02:00:05] that for you? So I I I mean this is just\n[02:00:08] me shamelessly shilling for everybody to\n[02:00:09] go to the gym and get jagged. Uh but I\n[02:00:12] think that would be good. One other\n[02:00:13] thing I think that is maybe a\n[02:00:17] slightly unusual strategy that women can\n[02:00:20] cultivate is receptiveness.\n[02:00:23] So I think especially in a postmeto\n[02:00:25] world, a lot of guys are very scared of\n[02:00:28] approaching. Guys have always been\n[02:00:29] scared of approaching women. But in a\n[02:00:31] postmeto world, they've been taught that\n[02:00:34] anything short of a hell yeah is a no\n[02:00:37] get away from me so that you don't make\n[02:00:39] the girl feel uncomfortable.\n[02:00:42] guys already were quite nervous going up\n[02:00:44] and talking to you. So, you have to\n[02:00:46] treat a man and his interest kind of\n[02:00:50] like slightly inexperienced golden\n[02:00:52] retriever. It needs to be very loud,\n[02:00:55] very obvious signals of interest from\n[02:00:57] you. So, in the middle ages or\n[02:01:00] aristocratic middle ages, ladies would\n[02:01:01] drop a handkerchief in front of a\n[02:01:03] gentleman. Oh, mom. Mom. Oh. In 2025 in\n[02:01:07] New York, there are women uh stealing\n[02:01:10] finance bros salads, finding their names\n[02:01:12] from the salad on Instagram, and then\n[02:01:14] messaging them and saying, \"Sorry, I\n[02:01:15] accidentally took your salad.\" Like,\n[02:01:17] that's the 2025 equivalent of dropping\n[02:01:18] the handkerchief. But receptiveness, I\n[02:01:20] think, is important. Like, hey ladies,\n[02:01:23] if you like that guy and he's not\n[02:01:24] approaching you, maybe assume that he\n[02:01:28] doesn't know that you like him and apply\n[02:01:31] a little bit more receptiveness. And\n[02:01:33] another the other side of this is if a\n[02:01:35] guy does come up to you and you're not\n[02:01:38] into him, don't mock him or make it like\n[02:01:41] uncomfortable to his face because you\n[02:01:44] are ruining the next girl's chances who\n[02:01:46] really does want him by making him feel\n[02:01:50] not enough for doing it. It's taken\n[02:01:53] a superhuman amount of strength to come\n[02:01:55] up and say, \"Hello, I just wanted to say\n[02:01:58] I thought you look really lovely today.\n[02:02:00] What's your name?\" That was the most\n[02:02:04] terrifying thing that that guy has done\n[02:02:05] that day. And if you don't, if you're\n[02:02:08] not receptive, even if you don't want\n[02:02:09] it, it kind of creates this culture of\n[02:02:12] men feeling broken and and like they\n[02:02:14] shouldn't do that more.\n[02:02:15] >> So,\n[02:02:16] >> yeah, there's some\n[02:02:17] >> What is um what is the most important\n[02:02:19] things we haven't talked about that we\n[02:02:20] should have talked about, Chris, as it\n[02:02:21] relates to this time of year?\n[02:02:23] >> The strivvers who want to make make\n[02:02:24] change, become someone else.\n[02:02:26] >> Stop taking life so seriously.\n[02:02:29] Like no one is getting out of this game\n[02:02:32] alive. Literally\n[02:02:35] in three generations, no one will even\n[02:02:38] remember your name.\n[02:02:40] And if that doesn't give you liberation\n[02:02:43] to just drop your [ __ ] problems for a\n[02:02:47] moment and find some joy, I don't know\n[02:02:50] what will. Like life is inherently\n[02:02:53] ridiculous and guaranteed to end sooner\n[02:02:56] or later.\n[02:02:59] So, you might as well enjoy the ride.\n[02:03:00] >> Do you know your great granddad's name?\n[02:03:02] >> Nope. Do\n[02:03:03] >> you?\n[02:03:03] >> No.\n[02:03:05] >> People don't like that idea. And I I I\n[02:03:07] get it. Maybe you will be remembered for\n[02:03:09] generations to come.\n[02:03:12] But just assume that you don't. This is\n[02:03:13] this deferred happiness syndrome thing,\n[02:03:15] dude. Like, don't wait. Life really is\n[02:03:19] happening right now.\n[02:03:22] There there is this belief that once\n[02:03:24] life's duties are out of the way, then\n[02:03:27] you can finally start doing the thing\n[02:03:29] you want to and fully living your life.\n[02:03:32] It's uh called the provisional life.\n[02:03:34] This sort of strange feeling that you're\n[02:03:36] not yet in your real life. For now,\n[02:03:38] you're doing this thing or that, but\n[02:03:40] there's always the fantasy that at some\n[02:03:41] point in future\n[02:03:43] the real thing will come about.\n[02:03:49] There is a kind of urgency that I think\n[02:03:51] we could all do with and uh that's not\n[02:03:54] to put pressure on people so that they\n[02:03:56] feel um like a failure if they fall\n[02:04:00] short.\n[02:04:01] It's not to deny the fact that people\n[02:04:03] have got real legitimate resource and\n[02:04:05] time constraints that mean that they\n[02:04:07] can't do a thing.\n[02:04:10] But don't wait.\n[02:04:11] This life really is happening right now.\n[02:04:13] And\n[02:04:16] I can't think of many times when you're\n[02:04:18] going to regret\n[02:04:22] trying\n[02:04:24] to make something happen. Now, I guess\n[02:04:26] one other thing, the sort of people that\n[02:04:29] have made it this deep into the episode\n[02:04:31] are the ones that this is about.\n[02:04:34] I think type A people have a type B\n[02:04:36] problem. So, insecure overachievers. Is\n[02:04:39] that type A?\n[02:04:40] >> Yep. Need to learn how to chill out and\n[02:04:42] relax. And lazy people need to learn how\n[02:04:44] to be motivated and work harder. But\n[02:04:47] given that someone is two hours into a\n[02:04:48] podcast between me and you, I'm going to\n[02:04:51] guess that they're probably type A. Some\n[02:04:53] version of a walking anxiety disorder\n[02:04:55] harnessed for productivity, as Andrew\n[02:04:57] Wilkinson says. And here's the thing\n[02:04:59] that you may have already realized,\n[02:05:01] which is type A people with type B\n[02:05:04] problems often get very little sympathy\n[02:05:07] because a miserable but outwardly\n[02:05:10] successful person always appears to be\n[02:05:12] in a much more preferential position\n[02:05:14] than a content being lazy but on the\n[02:05:17] verge of bankruptcy. One like one feels\n[02:05:22] like uh a a limitation and the other\n[02:05:25] feels like a choice. One is a systemic\n[02:05:28] imposition and the other is like a\n[02:05:30] bourgeoa luxury, right? I need someone\n[02:05:33] to teach me how to work harder and be\n[02:05:34] disciplined feels upward aiming, noble,\n[02:05:37] charitable. I need someone to teach me\n[02:05:38] how to switch off and relax feels\n[02:05:41] dopamineergic, transactional, like\n[02:05:43] opulent.\n[02:05:45] Every underdog movie ever has a scene of\n[02:05:49] some person down on their luck learning\n[02:05:51] how to work harder and pull themselves\n[02:05:52] up by their bootstraps.\n[02:05:55] None include a scene of a guy learning\n[02:05:57] how to log out of Slack at 6 PM or\n[02:06:00] finally enjoy a beach holiday.\n[02:06:02] >> And like I said before, maybe more\n[02:06:03] people do need David Gogggin screaming\n[02:06:05] in their face to go harder than need\n[02:06:07] Echart Tole whispering in their ear that\n[02:06:09] they're enough already.\n[02:06:11] But for a perhaps minority of people,\n[02:06:16] they actually need to hear the opposite\n[02:06:18] message. We need a a parasympathetic\n[02:06:20] Gogggins who's going to carry the TV\n[02:06:23] remote and the Cheetos. # rest harder\n[02:06:26] than me. We need to teach people to give\n[02:06:30] themselves a [ __ ] break. And this is\n[02:06:34] a an odd thing to hold in both our hands\n[02:06:37] at the same time. You do not want to\n[02:06:39] have a victim mindset. You want to have\n[02:06:40] agency on the world. You want to enact\n[02:06:42] stuff that's going on. You want to make\n[02:06:43] it and you're going to have to try\n[02:06:45] really hard.\n[02:06:46] And also,\n[02:06:48] you need to give yourself a break. You\n[02:06:51] have to know that if you nailed your\n[02:06:54] day, you don't just make it back to\n[02:06:56] zero. You got to plus 10.\n[02:06:59] There's no arbitrary minimum level of\n[02:07:00] productivity you have to achieve every\n[02:07:02] day in order to be worthwhile.\n[02:07:06] Are you religious? And I asked this\n[02:07:08] because you talked about the idea of\n[02:07:10] death and pursuit and you don't know how\n[02:07:12] long you've got left. M\n[02:07:13] >> and I think it probably has to be framed\n[02:07:14] in the context of what you think happens\n[02:07:17] thereafter.\n[02:07:19] >> Uh no, I wouldn't call myself religious.\n[02:07:21] Are you?\n[02:07:22] >> The way that I look at it is if you look\n[02:07:25] at our evolutionary history, we we're\n[02:07:26] meant to be part of something. But if\n[02:07:28] you look at the narrative of the last 20\n[02:07:30] years, that's given rise because of\n[02:07:31] social media. It's all about be your own\n[02:07:34] boss, remote work. I mean, we talked\n[02:07:36] about the whole kids thing, people\n[02:07:37] having less kids. So we're actually\n[02:07:38] swinging away from dependency to\n[02:07:41] independence and freedom. And it appears\n[02:07:44] to me that freedom and total\n[02:07:46] independence\n[02:07:47] >> will make you sick.\n[02:07:49] >> So naturally our masov needs going this\n[02:07:51] doesn't feel right. I need to I need\n[02:07:53] some I need to belong somewhere.\n[02:07:54] >> Think about this Maslo's hierarchy of\n[02:07:56] needs uh an existential crisis. You\n[02:07:59] asking yourself the question or anybody\n[02:08:00] that goes through this review process\n[02:08:02] chriswex.com/review.\n[02:08:03] Anyone that goes through that and\n[02:08:05] thinks, \"I don't know what to do with my\n[02:08:07] life.\" Think about how few people\n[02:08:10] throughout human history have ever had\n[02:08:11] to ask themselves that question.\n[02:08:13] >> Dayto-day, desperately just trying to\n[02:08:15] cling on to existence, unsure whether or\n[02:08:17] not the cold snap tomorrow is going to\n[02:08:20] come into the cave and kill them all.\n[02:08:24] An existential crisis is a luxurious\n[02:08:26] position to be in. And it feels\n[02:08:27] horrendous. How do you hold those two\n[02:08:29] things in your mind at one time? Yeah.\n[02:08:31] >> Like you're telling me I'm blessed\n[02:08:32] because I'm asking myself questions that\n[02:08:34] make me doubt the meaning of my life.\n[02:08:37] >> Yeah. And uh maybe that's where religion\n[02:08:40] is is stepping in now to try and give\n[02:08:42] people some guidance on that sort of\n[02:08:43] stuff. I saw a tweet that said um my\n[02:08:46] parents had the problem of survival and\n[02:08:48] I have the problem of\n[02:08:49] self-actualization.\n[02:08:50] And I think um sometimes\n[02:08:54] sometimes\n[02:08:56] some I got to be careful what I say\n[02:08:57] here, but I'm say you know they are both\n[02:09:00] they both come with their own challenges\n[02:09:02] I should say.\n[02:09:02] >> Absolutely. I mean and there's this idea\n[02:09:06] I had the other day of the the shame of\n[02:09:08] small fears which is what this is about.\n[02:09:10] So imagine explaining small fears to a\n[02:09:13] caveman. say, \"Uh, Grook, I worry about\n[02:09:19] sending this message.\" And Grrook would\n[02:09:21] respond,\n[02:09:23] \"Will the enemy try and see the\n[02:09:25] message?\" \"No.\" \"Will a saber-tooth\n[02:09:27] tiger smell the message?\" \"No.\" \"Will it\n[02:09:30] be etched on the wall for the rest of\n[02:09:32] time?\" \"No, it's a little small\n[02:09:34] rectangle.\"\n[02:09:36] \"Why are you worried?\"\n[02:09:38] uh in case somebody doesn't like me or\n[02:09:40] like what I say or I hurt their\n[02:09:41] feelings, he just laughs in your face.\n[02:09:43] And\n[02:09:45] we have to accept the fact that the sort\n[02:09:48] of fears we have in the modern world are\n[02:09:51] both uh smaller and more complex at the\n[02:09:55] same time. Yes, they're not about life\n[02:09:57] and death, but our nervous system has\n[02:09:59] been repurposed from bears to boundaries\n[02:10:03] and it does not know the difference. It\n[02:10:06] feels like you saying your truth,\n[02:10:08] saying, \"I don't think that this job's\n[02:10:10] working for me,\" or you said something\n[02:10:11] that doesn't land with me, and you you\n[02:10:13] crossed a line. That feels like you're\n[02:10:15] about to be rejected from the tribe,\n[02:10:17] even if the tribe is now just a WhatsApp\n[02:10:19] chat.\n[02:10:20] >> And this\n[02:10:22] repurposing of our nervous system\n[02:10:26] gives us the additional complexity of\n[02:10:28] the shame because now we feel shame.\n[02:10:32] Who am I to have this problem? Do I not\n[02:10:34] know that across the grand expanse of\n[02:10:36] history, this is nothing? My ancestors\n[02:10:38] would have dreamed to have had the\n[02:10:40] opportunity to have dealt with this\n[02:10:41] problem instead of the one that they do.\n[02:10:44] And yet, you can't deny the way that you\n[02:10:46] feel. It's like one of the biggest\n[02:10:47] lessons I've taken away from this year\n[02:10:48] is my emotions are legitimate. Like the\n[02:10:52] way that I feel is the way that I feel.\n[02:10:55] And denying myself that is not helping\n[02:10:59] anything at all. It's like you feel\n[02:11:01] scared before you go out on stage to go\n[02:11:03] and give this talk in front of a few\n[02:11:05] thousand people. You shouldn't be\n[02:11:06] scared. No one's going to come and kill\n[02:11:08] you. And you start shaming yourself for\n[02:11:10] your fear. And then you become anxious\n[02:11:12] about your shame about your fear and\n[02:11:14] then bitter about your anxiousness about\n[02:11:15] your shame about your fear. You've got\n[02:11:16] this infinite regress of mean emotions.\n[02:11:19] Like, huh?\n[02:11:22] The first one wasn't me. The first one\n[02:11:25] was the situation.\n[02:11:27] The second one was me. the third one,\n[02:11:29] the fourth one, and now I'm complicit in\n[02:11:31] my own suffering. I've made myself I've\n[02:11:34] made myself suffer unnecessarily. So,\n[02:11:36] and this is why the spit and sawdust and\n[02:11:40] caffeine and big dreams\n[02:11:43] really really important, but it has to\n[02:11:45] be married with some self- loveve. And\n[02:11:47] um maybe not in the beginning. Maybe if\n[02:11:49] you're trying to get the rocket ship off\n[02:11:50] the launch pad, use what you have,\n[02:11:52] including\n[02:11:54] your\n[02:11:56] self-hatred and your need for validation\n[02:11:58] from people and that chip on your\n[02:12:00] shoulder from the kids in school. But\n[02:12:01] after a while, you need to accept that\n[02:12:03] that is a toxic fuel if you use it for\n[02:12:04] too long. But when inertia is at its\n[02:12:07] greatest, I think you have to use what\n[02:12:08] you have.\n[02:12:09] >> I'm going to I'm going to ask you a\n[02:12:10] question, and this is a I just want to\n[02:12:12] try an experiment here. Can you think\n[02:12:14] out loud when you hear this question?\n[02:12:16] Okay.\n[02:12:18] So, I'm going to ask you immediately.\n[02:12:19] Think out loud. Okay.\n[02:12:22] Are you happy?\n[02:12:24] It's\n[02:12:24] >> complex question.\n[02:12:27] I have to work hard to be in a good mood\n[02:12:29] sometimes. And I don't like the fact\n[02:12:31] that I have to work hard to be in a good\n[02:12:32] mood. Uh it feels to me like I need to\n[02:12:35] stack the deck in my favor in order to\n[02:12:38] be able to do that. And I wish that I\n[02:12:40] didn't. And yet I'm really proud of all\n[02:12:44] of the things that I've done in order to\n[02:12:46] be able to make my my happiness\n[02:12:48] increase. I have a I have a set point. I\n[02:12:51] I had depression in my 20ies. I've had a\n[02:12:53] lot of anxiety as well and I'm really\n[02:12:55] proud of what I've done to overcome\n[02:12:57] that.\n[02:12:58] >> You have to work hard to be in a good\n[02:13:00] mood.\n[02:13:00] >> Yes.\n[02:13:00] >> Can you talk me through that? I've never\n[02:13:01] had this before from you.\n[02:13:03] >> Okay. Well, this year has been a\n[02:13:05] particularly difficult one for me\n[02:13:06] because I got kicked in the nuts by\n[02:13:08] health. America's a wonderful country,\n[02:13:10] but everything's trying to kill you. The\n[02:13:11] food system, the municipal water, the\n[02:13:13] building materials, the air quality, and\n[02:13:15] uh I lived in a house that had toxic\n[02:13:18] mold. I got mold poisoning, which a lot\n[02:13:20] of people in America have, and it's so\n[02:13:22] brutal. A ton of other stuff. And I\n[02:13:24] spent a long time, the best part of two\n[02:13:26] years, with two jobs. One was the show,\n[02:13:29] the other was trying to fix my health.\n[02:13:31] So after all of this, all this big\n[02:13:33] Modern Wisdom review thing, all I did,\n[02:13:36] my only two goals for this year at the\n[02:13:37] start of this year were don't let the\n[02:13:39] show drop and fix my health. That was\n[02:13:41] it. That was all I wanted. Nothing else.\n[02:13:43] Don't let the show drop and fix my\n[02:13:44] health. So I really was humbled, like\n[02:13:47] kicked in the nuts so many times that\n[02:13:48] they were two-dimensional. They turn\n[02:13:50] they disappeared if you looked at them\n[02:13:51] from the side. It felt like a cosmic\n[02:13:54] joke. It felt so\n[02:13:56] unfair. like working so hard to just\n[02:13:59] operate, going to bed at 7 o'clock at\n[02:14:02] night for six months, unable to sleep\n[02:14:04] because I was wired but tired because my\n[02:14:05] cortisol was inverted. Cortisol was\n[02:14:07] higher at night than it was in the\n[02:14:08] morning. So no matter how long I slept,\n[02:14:10] I was never able to feel rested in the\n[02:14:12] morning. and then dealing with it alone,\n[02:14:15] dealing with it on my own and trying to\n[02:14:17] go through complex environmental illness\n[02:14:20] doctors and treatments and all of this\n[02:14:22] stuff that really made me\n[02:14:25] face a lot of the fears of insufficiency\n[02:14:29] that I've had. I think every man knows\n[02:14:31] reflection when he's at his lowest and\n[02:14:33] I've been at some of my lowest points\n[02:14:35] over the last 12 months. So for me, the\n[02:14:38] happiness thing has been like I just\n[02:14:40] need to get through today. I just want\n[02:14:42] to perform well on the show. I can't\n[02:14:44] really think about the mood that I'm in\n[02:14:45] when I do it because the mood that I'm\n[02:14:47] in is just swimming in melancholy. I\n[02:14:50] don't feel very good. It felt like it\n[02:14:53] felt like my better self was slipping\n[02:14:55] through my fingers like it was being\n[02:14:57] ripped away from me due to\n[02:15:02] some thing that I hadn't done. It felt\n[02:15:05] so unfair, so comically unfair, like a\n[02:15:08] literally like a personal curse that had\n[02:15:10] been hit at me. And it was specifically\n[02:15:12] on the thing that I care about the most.\n[02:15:14] So mold does typically lots of things,\n[02:15:17] but three things. Uh energy, mood, and\n[02:15:19] cognition. So it makes you tired all the\n[02:15:21] time. It makes you low mood. And it\n[02:15:24] makes you forgetful. Like there was a\n[02:15:26] day when I looked down and I forgot how\n[02:15:28] to tie my shoes. Couldn't remember how\n[02:15:30] to put my shoelaces together in order to\n[02:15:32] tie my shoes. I was forgetting words.\n[02:15:34] forgetting the names of people that I'd\n[02:15:35] known, forgetting the names of like\n[02:15:36] friends, dogs and stuff that I'd spent\n[02:15:38] time with.\n[02:15:40] And um yeah, this year has not been a\n[02:15:42] year where I've been trying to maximize\n[02:15:43] my happiness. It's one where I've been\n[02:15:44] trying to sort of survive. And I did it\n[02:15:48] pretty much silently. I did a video\n[02:15:49] about it in maybe October time,\n[02:15:51] something like that. But again, my I\n[02:15:54] want to keep my private life private\n[02:15:55] thing was\n[02:15:59] important to me because I didn't want to\n[02:16:01] have other people\n[02:16:04] Being ill. Anybody that is dealing with\n[02:16:07] a an illness will know this.\n[02:16:11] Talking about your illness is kind of\n[02:16:12] like having a birthday that what you get\n[02:16:15] is inundated with lots of messages from\n[02:16:17] people who are all really well-wishing,\n[02:16:20] but what it results in is just a ton of\n[02:16:21] admin and a load of guilt if you don't\n[02:16:23] reply. So, I didn't I knew that if I\n[02:16:25] started talking about all of the stuff\n[02:16:27] that I was going through, it would be\n[02:16:28] great because it would make other people\n[02:16:29] that were dealing with it feel less\n[02:16:30] alone. But it would also be an\n[02:16:31] additional burden on me while I'm trying\n[02:16:33] to fix myself of trying to sift through\n[02:16:36] all of my friend knows how to do a\n[02:16:38] parasite cleanse using goat milk and you\n[02:16:40] can, you know, pray to the full moon.\n[02:16:42] Like, dude, I really appreciate you\n[02:16:43] caring about me so much that you've\n[02:16:44] tried to link me in with this person.\n[02:16:46] And sure enough, this documentary that I\n[02:16:48] put on the channel that people can go\n[02:16:50] and watch came out and that happened. It\n[02:16:53] mercifully I was a little bit further\n[02:16:54] through the journey. But yeah, man.\n[02:16:56] Like, how do I optimize my happiness is\n[02:17:00] a luxury that a lot of people aren't in\n[02:17:01] a position to do. And and that that was\n[02:17:03] me this year. I didn't have the spare\n[02:17:05] capacity to optimize my happiness.\n[02:17:07] >> And you still try hard to be you still\n[02:17:09] have to put significant effort in to be\n[02:17:11] content, happy.\n[02:17:13] >> Um yeah, at the moment, yeah. Uh I've\n[02:17:17] been working hard on it. You know,\n[02:17:20] happiness\n[02:17:21] really only exists when uncertainty\n[02:17:24] isn't there. It's very difficult to be\n[02:17:26] uncertain and happy at the same time.\n[02:17:28] You'd even make the argument that humans\n[02:17:30] never chase happiness directly. They\n[02:17:33] always chase certainty first because if\n[02:17:36] you don't know how the future is going\n[02:17:37] to pan out, how are you able to be h\n[02:17:40] especially if it's like chronic\n[02:17:41] uncertainty like you know severe\n[02:17:42] uncertainty, not just I don't know who's\n[02:17:44] going to win the sports game tomorrow.\n[02:17:46] And for me, I didn't know if I was going\n[02:17:50] to get escape velocity to get out of\n[02:17:52] this health stuff. And if that's the\n[02:17:55] case, where am I deriving my happiness\n[02:17:58] from? All I see is this endless stretch\n[02:18:00] of work and discomfort and fatigue and\n[02:18:03] tiredness and solitude. And I I I feel\n[02:18:07] bad for the guy that had to go through\n[02:18:09] that this year. Like I feel for him cuz\n[02:18:11] it wasn't it wasn't easy and it was\n[02:18:13] lonely. And I'm really proud. I'm really\n[02:18:17] really proud that\n[02:18:19] I kept showing up. I didn't give up on\n[02:18:22] myself. I hit dead ends with regards to\n[02:18:24] treatment, with regards to testing. It\n[02:18:27] was like months where\n[02:18:31] I was going to bed at 7:00 p.m., waking\n[02:18:33] up at\n[02:18:36] 8:00 a.m., still tired, sleeping\n[02:18:39] straight through.\n[02:18:39] >> There's something interesting here\n[02:18:41] because the three areas that you said\n[02:18:42] mold impacts are also the three areas\n[02:18:44] that everybody kind of knows you for,\n[02:18:46] right?\n[02:18:47] >> And that's kind of\n[02:18:47] >> why I said personal curse. It felt like\n[02:18:50] it felt like somebody had designed\n[02:18:53] a pathology just for me and it would hit\n[02:18:56] at all of the places that I took my self\n[02:18:58] worth from.\n[02:18:59] >> Does it leave a question then which is\n[02:19:01] if you take everything I value now that\n[02:19:03] gives me selfworth,\n[02:19:05] what remains?\n[02:19:06] >> Well, that was a question I had to ask\n[02:19:08] myself this year\n[02:19:09] >> and what did remain?\n[02:19:11] >> Somebody who's kind, somebody who's\n[02:19:14] genuinely kind and uh\n[02:19:18] sensitive. And I always thought that\n[02:19:20] sensitivity was a weakness, but it's\n[02:19:22] not. At least not for me. Somebody who\n[02:19:24] is resilient\n[02:19:26] in a very normal way. So boring\n[02:19:29] victories\n[02:19:31] is something that I've had to learn to\n[02:19:32] take pleasure from this year. You know,\n[02:19:35] is today\n[02:19:39] the grandest accomplishment of your\n[02:19:40] entire life?\n[02:19:42] No. but you went for a walk or you were\n[02:19:46] kind to that person at the supermarket\n[02:19:48] or you were gentle with yourself when\n[02:19:49] you became frustrated.\n[02:19:51] And I had to get over the shame of small\n[02:19:55] pleasures that somehow me feeling proud\n[02:19:58] about the way that I showed up in a tiny\n[02:20:00] minute way that nobody else saw was sort\n[02:20:03] of a comment of the smallness of my\n[02:20:05] life. Oh, you must not have a lot going\n[02:20:06] on. Like how feeble, how weak, how\n[02:20:10] minuscule must your life be? that that\n[02:20:14] seeing that golden retriever was the\n[02:20:15] best part of your morning.\n[02:20:18] And yet I realized that that was worth\n[02:20:23] being happy about and that denying\n[02:20:25] myself the opportunity to be happy about\n[02:20:27] something small is basically me holding\n[02:20:29] my happiness hostage. Like until the\n[02:20:31] bank deposit is sufficiently large, the\n[02:20:34] ledger doesn't kick in. Like I can't\n[02:20:36] pick up pennies. I can only pick up $100\n[02:20:38] bills. And um it really [ __ ] humbled\n[02:20:42] me, dude. Especially if you're flying\n[02:20:43] high, you know, two years ago, the show\n[02:20:46] is just vertical. And it, you know,\n[02:20:49] numerically it still is now, but it\n[02:20:51] really really felt like something had\n[02:20:53] just come in to bring my feet back down\n[02:20:55] to earth. And I feel different to the\n[02:20:59] person I was last year, but I'm much\n[02:21:01] more connected, I think, to a sort of\n[02:21:04] truth. Alander Boton says, \"The best men\n[02:21:06] are those who have been broken.\" And\n[02:21:08] this year has definitely broken me.\n[02:21:10] >> Are you doing better now?\n[02:21:11] >> I am. Yeah, I am. Um, it's if I was at a\n[02:21:14] three 12 months ago, I'm probably at a\n[02:21:17] seven to an eight now. So, don't let the\n[02:21:20] show drop and fix my health. Like, I got\n[02:21:22] close to doing both of those. We've got\n[02:21:24] to wrap up now, but I wanted to give you\n[02:21:26] the chance to end this with any closing\n[02:21:28] thoughts that you might have for the\n[02:21:30] listener that's gotten this far in this\n[02:21:31] conversation\n[02:21:32] >> and who is really at, you know, the\n[02:21:33] foothills of potentially a new version\n[02:21:35] of themselves.\n[02:21:36] Is there anything else,\n[02:21:38] >> Chris, that you wanted to say?\n[02:21:41] >> Well, first off, congratulations for\n[02:21:42] making it through all of this. There's a\n[02:21:44] lot of uncomfortable things to face with\n[02:21:46] conversations like this. It really\n[02:21:49] forces you to reckon with parts of your\n[02:21:52] direction. You're like, [ __ ] Like, I I\n[02:21:54] really don't want to have to have that\n[02:21:56] conversation. I really don't want to\n[02:21:57] face that thing. There's a great quote\n[02:21:58] from John Paul Sartra. He said, I've led\n[02:22:02] a toothless life. I have never bitten\n[02:22:04] into anything.\n[02:22:06] I was waiting. I was reserving myself\n[02:22:08] for later on. And I've just noticed that\n[02:22:11] my teeth have gone.\n[02:22:15] This idea of being shunted to the side\n[02:22:17] of your own life, of being a\n[02:22:21] an NPC, a non-playable character when\n[02:22:23] you should have been the main character.\n[02:22:27] uh\n[02:22:28] you can be in service of other people,\n[02:22:30] but you can still have some sort of\n[02:22:32] action that you take into the world.\n[02:22:33] This deferred life thing, waiting for\n[02:22:36] life to begin.\n[02:22:40] It's a great time of year to question\n[02:22:41] that assumption. What would have to\n[02:22:43] happen by the end of next year for you\n[02:22:44] to look back on it and consider it a\n[02:22:45] success? What would I do to make\n[02:22:46] 85-year-old me miserable? What would I\n[02:22:48] what would 85-year-old me wish that I\n[02:22:50] did more of? What are the emotions I'm\n[02:22:52] unprepared to feel? What are the\n[02:22:55] thoughts that I thought too many times\n[02:22:56] last year? If this was a movie and the\n[02:22:58] audience was watching, what would they\n[02:23:00] be screaming at the screen telling me to\n[02:23:03] do with my life?\n[02:23:05] They're cool questions and uh they\n[02:23:08] certainly helped me. They helped me find\n[02:23:10] direction. So, I hope they've helped\n[02:23:11] everyone else as well.\n[02:23:14] We have a closing tradition where the\n[02:23:15] last guest leaves a question for the\n[02:23:16] next, not knowing who they're leaving it\n[02:23:17] for. And the question left for you is\n[02:23:18] quite relevant. What is the most\n[02:23:21] important component of human joy and\n[02:23:24] endeavor that you believe must be\n[02:23:27] preserved in priority?\n[02:23:30] Oh, wonderful.\n[02:23:36] I think agency\n[02:23:38] I think the belief that you have\n[02:23:42] the ability to impact your surroundings.\n[02:23:45] Uh because the opposite of agency is you\n[02:23:47] basically holding your hands up and\n[02:23:48] saying, \"I'm at the mercy of the world.\n[02:23:51] You happen to life. Life doesn't happen\n[02:23:53] to you.\"\n[02:23:56] Chris, thank you. You are going on tour\n[02:23:58] and uh you're going on tour next year in\n[02:24:00] March, I believe. And you're going in on\n[02:24:02] tour in an area where I know we have\n[02:24:03] lots of listeners,\n[02:24:04] >> Australia, New Zealand, Bali.\n[02:24:05] >> So, I'm going to link below a link to\n[02:24:07] anyone that wants to come see you on\n[02:24:08] tour,\n[02:24:09] >> but also highly recommend people go\n[02:24:11] download the the modern wisdom annual\n[02:24:13] review template. So, I'm going to link\n[02:24:14] that below as well. Look in the\n[02:24:15] description. It's all there.\n[02:24:17] >> Is there anything else that if people,\n[02:24:19] you know, your channel, people should go\n[02:24:20] subscribe to your channel if they've\n[02:24:21] liked what they've heard today. Is there\n[02:24:22] anything else?\n[02:24:24] >> I had a conversation with Naval\n[02:24:25] Ravocant.\n[02:24:26] >> Oh my god, I love that.\n[02:24:27] >> It's the people always ask like, \"What's\n[02:24:29] the best conversation you've ever had?\"\n[02:24:30] And I say, \"It's like trying to choose\n[02:24:31] between a thousand children.\" Um, that\n[02:24:34] was really special. And for people who\n[02:24:36] know him, you should watch it again.\n[02:24:38] >> For people who don't know him, you\n[02:24:40] should go and check it out. So, we can\n[02:24:41] link that below. I highly recommend\n[02:24:42] that. Yeah. Honestly, the modern wisdom\n[02:24:45] manual review template, it's free. Copy\n[02:24:47] it, use it, and um that'll put you on my\n[02:24:50] mailing list for a once a week\n[02:24:52] newsletter, which is a lot of the\n[02:24:53] thoughts, a lot of the ideas that we've\n[02:24:54] gone through today. I wanted to uh say\n[02:24:57] something to you before we finished up\n[02:24:58] as well.\n[02:24:59] >> Um, no, it's a it's a thank you. So, uh\n[02:25:03] I think people often wonder about what's\n[02:25:04] going on behind the scenes or what\n[02:25:06] somebody's like behind the scenes. And,\n[02:25:08] uh I had a I needed some advice from\n[02:25:12] you. So, I messaged you on a Saturday\n[02:25:15] afternoon on WhatsApp and within 30\n[02:25:18] seconds, you rang me and then put me in\n[02:25:20] a group with like the guy that was able\n[02:25:24] to help with this thing and then\n[02:25:26] basically sort of carried us through\n[02:25:28] this process for the next couple of\n[02:25:30] weeks and kept checking in with me.\n[02:25:32] That was that was very very meaningful\n[02:25:34] and you didn't need to do it. And uh I\n[02:25:35] very much appreciate having you. I mean\n[02:25:37] you you in my phone book is like a\n[02:25:39] [ __ ] hidden weapon. you're kind of\n[02:25:41] like the jocker willing to be able to\n[02:25:42] get, you know, stuff sorted. But uh I\n[02:25:44] just wanted to say thank you for that\n[02:25:45] cuz it was it was really really kind and\n[02:25:47] um yeah, it's it's awesome to feel like\n[02:25:50] people have got your back and that made\n[02:25:52] me feel like that.\n[02:25:53] >> I appreciate that. Um yeah, you've\n[02:25:55] earned that because you you've done so\n[02:25:57] much for so many other people and you've\n[02:25:58] been so selfless in a way that I aspire\n[02:26:00] to be. Like I'm not very good at like\n[02:26:03] staying in touch and connecting and\n[02:26:05] replying and stuff like that, but in\n[02:26:06] those particular moments, you know, I\n[02:26:09] think we are a team.\n[02:26:11] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[02:26:13] >> So, uh, so I appreciate that. Thank you\n[02:26:16] so much.\n[02:26:16] >> Thank you, mate.\n[02:26:21] >> This is something that I've made for\n[02:26:22] you. I realized that the direio audience\n[02:26:25] are striv\n[02:26:28] goals that we want to accomplish. And\n[02:26:30] one of the things I've learned is that\n[02:26:32] when you aim at the big big big goal, it\n[02:26:34] can feel incredibly psychologically\n[02:26:37] uncomfortable because it's kind of like\n[02:26:39] being stood at the foot of Mount Everest\n[02:26:40] and looking upwards. The way to\n[02:26:42] accomplish your goals is by breaking\n[02:26:44] them down into tiny small steps. And we\n[02:26:47] call this in our team the 1%. And\n[02:26:48] actually this philosophy is highly\n[02:26:51] responsible for much of our success\n[02:26:52] here. So what we've done so that you at\n[02:26:55] home can accomplish any big goal that\n[02:26:57] you have is we've made these 1% diaries\n[02:27:00] and we released these last year and they\n[02:27:02] all sold out. So I asked my team over\n[02:27:04] and over again to bring the diaries back\n[02:27:05] but also to introduce some new colors\n[02:27:07] and to make some minor tweaks to the\n[02:27:09] diary. So now we have a better range for\n[02:27:13] you. So, if you have a big goal in mind\n[02:27:15] and you need a framework and a process\n[02:27:17] and some motivation, then I highly\n[02:27:19] recommend you get one of these diaries\n[02:27:21] before they all sell out once again. And\n[02:27:23] you can get yours now at the diary.com\n[02:27:25] where you can get 20% off our Black\n[02:27:28] Friday bundle. And if you want the link,\n[02:27:29] the link is in the description below.",
