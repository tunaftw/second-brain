  "transcript": "[00:00] You've written one of the best-selling\n[00:01] books in history about habits because\n[00:04] people always need more practical help\n[00:07] with implementing their habits. And I\n[00:09] have different strategies and different\n[00:11] tools to get habits to stick, including\n[00:13] one principle that is probably the\n[00:15] single most important for building\n[00:16] habits, but so much of it is about\n[00:18] mastering the art of getting started.\n[00:20] >> Let's get started then. James Clear is\n[00:22] one of the world's leading habit\n[00:24] experts. is educating millions to build\n[00:26] lasting habits, master goal setting, and\n[00:29] ultimately redesign their lives.\n[00:31] >> There are four different stages that\n[00:32] every habit goes through. Q, craving,\n[00:34] response, and reward. So, first, we want\n[00:36] to make it obvious. Easier it is to see\n[00:37] or get your attention, the more likely\n[00:39] you are to act on it. The second is\n[00:41] about the craving. It's all about making\n[00:42] it attractive. And the more engaging or\n[00:44] exciting it is, the more likely you are\n[00:45] to stick with it. The third is to make\n[00:47] it easy. The easier a habit is to\n[00:48] perform, the more likely it is to\n[00:50] happen. And then the fourth and final\n[00:51] one is to make it satisfying. And that's\n[00:53] about increasing the odds that you do it\n[00:55] next time. And there's some tools that\n[00:56] we can go through. But one of the big\n[00:58] takeaways from atomic habits is it's\n[01:00] easier to build a new habit if you stack\n[01:02] it on top of the habit you're already\n[01:04] doing. So let's say that your current\n[01:05] habit is you make a cup of coffee. And\n[01:07] the new habit that you want to build is\n[01:09] you want to start meditating. So then\n[01:11] you could say, \"All right, after I make\n[01:12] my morning cup of coffee, I will\n[01:13] meditate for 60 seconds.\" And you can do\n[01:15] it for anything. There's also a\n[01:17] framework that I call hats, haircuts,\n[01:19] and tattoos. the secret to winning,\n[01:20] habit shaping, and real lesson of\n[01:22] getting 1% better every day. And we can\n[01:24] talk about all of them.\n[01:25] >> But is there any frameworks, any\n[01:26] tactics? If you're trying to break a\n[01:28] habit, if you want to break a bad habit,\n[01:30] there's some things that you can do.\n[01:32] >> James, the book has shaped tens and tens\n[01:33] and tens of millions of lives, is there\n[01:35] anything you look back on that you\n[01:36] regret? If I could add something, I\n[01:38] would add this because if you really\n[01:40] want to make progress again and again,\n[01:41] if you want to get to the top and stay\n[01:43] at the top and you need to be able to\n[01:47] I see messages all the time in the\n[01:49] comment section that some of you didn't\n[01:50] realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you\n[01:52] could do me a favor and double check if\n[01:54] you're a subscriber to this channel,\n[01:55] that would be tremendously appreciated.\n[01:57] It's the simple, it's the free thing\n[01:59] that anybody that watches this show\n[02:00] frequently can do to help us here to\n[02:02] keep everything going in this show in\n[02:03] the trajectory it's on. So, please do\n[02:05] double check if you've subscribed and uh\n[02:07] thank you so much because in a strange\n[02:09] way you are you're part of our history\n[02:11] and you're on this journey with us and I\n[02:13] appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank\n[02:14] you.\n[02:22] >> James, you've written thousands and\n[02:25] thousands of things, but one particular\n[02:26] thing you wrote called Atomic Habits is\n[02:28] one of the bestselling books in history.\n[02:31] Um, it is rumored to be potentially\n[02:35] in the top 100 books that have sold in\n[02:37] history of all time, but also rumored to\n[02:39] be potentially the youngest book to make\n[02:41] the top 100 books in history. My\n[02:44] question is,\n[02:46] what has the success of Atomic Habits\n[02:48] taught you about the nature of humanity\n[02:51] and humans?\n[02:53] We all have habits. We all need habits.\n[02:55] You know, it's one of those really it's\n[02:57] an interesting concept because it is\n[02:59] both universal in the sense that we all\n[03:01] have them, we all need them, but it's\n[03:03] also highly individual. Your habits feel\n[03:05] like your habits, not mine, you know,\n[03:07] and so it's both universal and specific.\n[03:09] Uh, and that's that's an interesting\n[03:11] contrast, and I think it leads to one of\n[03:13] the reasons why people are so interested\n[03:15] in the topic. You know, we all have\n[03:17] them. We all need them. We all feel like\n[03:18] they're our own, and we want to come up\n[03:20] with our little version of them. But the\n[03:22] habit also is like an entrance ramp to\n[03:24] how you spend your time in other ways.\n[03:26] Like the habit of pulling out your\n[03:28] phone, that habit might only take two\n[03:30] seconds to do, but then it might dictate\n[03:32] what you do for the next hour. You know,\n[03:34] you're answering emails or browsing\n[03:36] social media or playing a video game or\n[03:37] whatever. And it was really the initial\n[03:39] habit of pulling out the phone that\n[03:41] shaped what that hour did. So the\n[03:44] influence of our habits is enormous. You\n[03:46] know, in a lot of ways, your your\n[03:49] results in life are kind of a lagging\n[03:50] measure of the habits that precede them.\n[03:52] You know, like your knowledge is a\n[03:54] lagging measure of your reading and\n[03:55] learning habits. Your bank account is a\n[03:58] lagging measure of your financial\n[03:59] habits. Even silly stuff like the amount\n[04:02] of clutter in your living room is the\n[04:03] lagging measure of your cleaning habits.\n[04:05] And so, we all so badly want our\n[04:09] outcomes to change, you know, we also\n[04:10] badly want our results to change, but\n[04:12] the results are not actually the thing\n[04:14] that needs to change. It's like fix the\n[04:15] habits and the results will fix\n[04:17] themselves. Change the inputs and the\n[04:18] outputs will shift automatically.\n[04:20] >> And it's funny because the book has\n[04:21] shaped tens and tens and tens of\n[04:23] millions of lives, but it also must have\n[04:24] shaped you in some ways.\n[04:25] >> Oh, of course. In a way, I had to learn\n[04:28] the concepts to write the book. Like I\n[04:30] had to build writing habits to write the\n[04:32] book. The fact that I have struggled\n[04:33] with habits and failed with them. The\n[04:35] fact that I've tried things and it\n[04:36] hasn't worked out. The fact that I have\n[04:37] eventually broken through and been able\n[04:39] to build habits. that all of that made\n[04:42] the book better because you realize how\n[04:44] hard it is to have something practical\n[04:46] to say. I actually think I have this\n[04:48] little theory that uh a lot of books are\n[04:50] branded as how-to books, but they're\n[04:52] actually what to books. They tell you\n[04:54] what to think. You should be confident.\n[04:55] You should believe in yourself. You\n[04:56] should take XYZ action, but they don't\n[04:59] actually tell you how to do those\n[05:01] things.\n[05:01] >> And in and in hindsight, is there\n[05:04] anything you look back on that you\n[05:05] regret about the book?\n[05:06] >> I don't think there's anything that I\n[05:08] regret. If I could add something, I\n[05:10] would add something. I would add this\n[05:11] simple question, which is, what would it\n[05:13] look like if this was fun? What would it\n[05:16] look like if your habits were fun? Like\n[05:18] the most common New Year's resolution is\n[05:19] to do some form of exercise. So, you\n[05:22] know, I feel like a lot of people are\n[05:23] going to the gym in January because they\n[05:25] feel like they should go to the gym or\n[05:27] society wants them to go to the gym, you\n[05:28] know, or there's some kind of social\n[05:30] pressure to go to the gym. But if we\n[05:33] were to come up with a list of what it\n[05:34] means to be active and fit, you know,\n[05:36] and healthy, we could come up with a\n[05:38] long list of things. Go to the gym and\n[05:40] lift weights. You could kayak, rock\n[05:42] climb, do yoga, pilates, what, like, you\n[05:45] know, we could probably sit here for\n[05:46] like 15 minutes and come up with a real\n[05:47] long list. And for most of your habits,\n[05:50] if it's an important habit to you, I\n[05:51] think it's worth it to take 10 minutes\n[05:53] and write that list out and then look at\n[05:55] it at the end and say, \"What would this\n[05:57] look like if it was fun? what's which of\n[05:59] these options is the most fun to me. And\n[06:02] that doesn't mean that your habits will\n[06:04] be like the most fun thing that you do\n[06:06] each day. You know, it's not like it's\n[06:07] always going to feel like going to a\n[06:08] concert or something, but it does mean\n[06:11] that pretty much any habit can be more\n[06:13] fun than the default, you know? So, you\n[06:15] might as well take a little bit of time\n[06:16] to figure out what is the fun version of\n[06:18] this. And ultimately, I think the reason\n[06:20] why this matters is that if you're\n[06:23] having fun, you're more likely to stick\n[06:25] with it. You're more likely to\n[06:26] persevere. The person who's having fun\n[06:28] is actually the person who's dangerous.\n[06:30] Like you don't want to compete with them\n[06:32] because they're having a good time. When\n[06:33] it gets difficult, they're way more\n[06:35] likely to stick with it. The person who\n[06:37] it felt like a hassle at the start was\n[06:39] kind of, you know, annoying. They sort\n[06:40] of have a negative frame around the the\n[06:42] behavior to begin with. Well, as soon as\n[06:44] it gets difficult, they didn't want to\n[06:45] do it in the first place. So, they're\n[06:47] much more likely to give up. David\n[06:49] Epstein, who's the author of uh Range\n[06:51] and Sports Genius, friend of mine, um he\n[06:53] told me once, \"Grit is fit.\" Grit is\n[06:55] fit. And what he means is that everybody\n[06:58] wants to be gritty. They want to\n[06:59] persevere. But the way that you display\n[07:01] that grit and discipline and\n[07:03] perseverance is in areas where you are\n[07:05] well suited, where it's a good fit for\n[07:07] you. If it's a good fit, if you're well\n[07:09] suited for it, if you're having fun, if\n[07:11] you're interested and engaged, then\n[07:13] you're way more likely to stick with it.\n[07:15] And so, in a lot of ways, I feel like\n[07:17] the biggest hurdle to clear, and this is\n[07:19] true maybe for life in general, but\n[07:21] definitely for habits, because everybody\n[07:22] wants to be consistent with their\n[07:23] habits. Everybody wants to stick to\n[07:25] them. The biggest hurdle to clear is are\n[07:27] you interested? Are are you engaged? Are\n[07:29] you having fun? And so the more that you\n[07:31] can get closer to that, the more fun it\n[07:33] can be, the more likely you are to\n[07:35] persevere and stick with it.\n[07:36] >> I was just thinking about this idea\n[07:38] actually the other day because I I was\n[07:40] writing when we hit a subscriber\n[07:42] milestone. I was writing to think about\n[07:43] what actually mattered the most. And one\n[07:45] of the first thing I wrote was creating\n[07:46] the conditions to out persist.\n[07:49] >> And what I mean by that is like create\n[07:50] the conditions so that you can do this\n[07:52] for long enough that things start\n[07:54] compounding in your favor. like learning\n[07:55] starts compounding in your favor like\n[07:57] the the returns like the the subscribers\n[08:00] or it could be your finances whatever\n[08:01] start compounding in your favor.\n[08:02] >> The question that you asked is very\n[08:04] similar to one that I ask myself a lot\n[08:06] which is am I creating the conditions\n[08:07] for success. So I had a really good\n[08:10] stretch of training in the gym and then\n[08:12] uh about two and a half years ago I was\n[08:14] in pretty good shape and then I had a\n[08:16] year where it was just like really\n[08:17] inconsistent. I missed a lot of workouts\n[08:18] things sometimes it would go well\n[08:19] sometimes it wouldn't whatever. And\n[08:21] after that year I was like okay I got to\n[08:23] change something. And on the surface,\n[08:25] you look at it and you think, I'm having\n[08:27] trouble with the workouts. You think\n[08:28] there's some problem with, you know,\n[08:30] exercise, but that was actually not the\n[08:32] problem. The problem was I wasn't\n[08:33] creating the conditions for success.\n[08:36] >> And so, there were lots of other things\n[08:37] that were intervening and like making\n[08:39] interrupting my day and making it easy\n[08:41] for me to miss. So, this last year, I\n[08:43] hired a trainer and he shows up at 11:00\n[08:45] a.m. every, you know, four days a week.\n[08:47] And when he gets there, every single\n[08:48] time it's a hassle because I'm in the\n[08:51] middle of something. Um, right? every\n[08:53] time I've got something going on and I\n[08:54] kind of am like annoyed by it that he's\n[08:56] there, but we're creating the conditions\n[08:58] for success and it makes sure that I get\n[08:59] down there and I do it and then every\n[09:01] time when I get done with the workout,\n[09:02] I'm like, I'm glad I took the time to do\n[09:04] that. Um, and so nothing really needed\n[09:07] to change with the workout. That was not\n[09:08] the problem. The problem was I didn't\n[09:10] have the right conditions to start the\n[09:12] workout. M\n[09:13] >> and so I think this actually reveals a\n[09:16] really deep and important thing about\n[09:18] habits which is\n[09:20] so much of it is about mastering the art\n[09:23] of getting started. It's making it easy\n[09:25] to start in a way like probably 70% of\n[09:28] what's in atomic habits are different\n[09:30] strategies and different ideas and\n[09:32] different tools that help you get\n[09:34] started or makes starting easier. This\n[09:36] trainer who I've been working with now\n[09:38] he he came over the other day and he\n[09:39] told me, \"Yeah, I had a class in the\n[09:41] morning. eight people were supposed to\n[09:42] come, but it was like it was a pretty\n[09:44] gross day. It was like rainy and wet and\n[09:46] kind of cold and only two people showed\n[09:48] up. And I was talking to him about it\n[09:50] and I said, \"What's interesting to me\n[09:51] about that is how little of an edge you\n[09:54] need to gain an advantage.\" You know,\n[09:56] really what we're talking about there is\n[09:58] you just need to be okay with being\n[10:00] inconvenienced or uncomfortable for like\n[10:02] 5 to 10 minutes getting dressed, getting\n[10:04] through the rain, getting into your car,\n[10:05] getting to the gym. The workout is the\n[10:07] same that it's always been. It's the\n[10:09] same. you're in the same gym that you\n[10:10] are in the summer or when the weather's\n[10:11] beautiful or whatever. So, it's really\n[10:13] can you handle that like five minutes of\n[10:15] inconvenience.\n[10:16] >> And so many things in life are like\n[10:18] that. Can you master that little moment?\n[10:19] And if you can and you can still get\n[10:21] started, that's when you gain an\n[10:24] advantage. Everybody works out on the\n[10:26] good days. But on the days when you feel\n[10:27] stressed and tired, on the days when the\n[10:29] weather's bad and it's kind of\n[10:30] inconvenient, on the days when you don't\n[10:32] really feel like it, can you show up?\n[10:34] even if it's in a small way. One of my\n[10:37] little mantras that I try to keep in\n[10:38] mind is reduce the scope but stick to\n[10:40] the schedule. So the normal scope might\n[10:44] be I write for 30 minutes and then you\n[10:46] look up at the clock and you're like I\n[10:47] only have 15. And sometimes what happens\n[10:49] in your head is you're like oh I don't\n[10:50] have enough time to write today. Or\n[10:52] you're like oh I was planning to work\n[10:53] out for 60 minutes and you look up and\n[10:54] you're like time got away from me. I\n[10:55] only have 20 minutes now. I don't have\n[10:57] time to go to the gym. It's easy to talk\n[10:58] yourself out of it but reduce the scope\n[11:02] but stick to the schedule. It's like,\n[11:03] well, I only got 20 minutes instead of\n[11:05] 60, so I'll just get in there and do a\n[11:06] couple sets of squats and that's it. And\n[11:08] I've had so many workouts that have been\n[11:09] like that where you're like almost, you\n[11:11] know, it's easy to be kind of\n[11:13] disappointed you weren't able to do the\n[11:14] whole thing that you wanted to do. But\n[11:16] you didn't throw up a zero. And if you\n[11:19] don't throw up a zero, you maintain the\n[11:21] habit. And if you maintain the habit,\n[11:22] all you need is time. And so the bad\n[11:25] days are more important than the good\n[11:26] days in that sense. You need to figure\n[11:28] out how do you show up even if when it's\n[11:29] not optimal.\n[11:30] >> And that first five minutes. Yeah, I was\n[11:33] thinking about all the the first five\n[11:35] minute battles that I've won over the\n[11:37] last week because I've, you know, I lost\n[11:38] track of my workout. I've been traveling\n[11:39] through Asia on this tour I've been\n[11:41] doing. Got back, fallen off. The\n[11:45] motivation doesn't seem to be quite the\n[11:48] same as it was before I left. So, it's\n[11:51] like I'm dragging myself there. The\n[11:52] workouts are like four out of 10. Um,\n[11:55] but I went.\n[11:56] >> Yeah.\n[11:57] >> And now I'm I think the momentum is\n[11:58] building. But that first 5 minute point,\n[12:01] is there anything that you've learned,\n[12:02] any frameworks, any tactics for for\n[12:05] making sure you you get past that first\n[12:06] 5 minutes so you can get into the the\n[12:08] flow of the habit?\n[12:09] >> Yeah, there's multiple things. So first\n[12:10] thing is try to prime the environment to\n[12:13] make the first action easy. Prime the\n[12:16] environment to make the first action\n[12:17] easy. So let's say writing for example.\n[12:19] I find that for myself the biggest point\n[12:21] of friction is choosing what to write\n[12:23] about. Once I've actually finally\n[12:25] settled, this is the thing I'm writing\n[12:27] today, then I can get into it and I'm\n[12:29] off and running. Um, but I'll sit there\n[12:32] for two hours just debating whether it's\n[12:33] the right thing to be focused on writing\n[12:35] or not. You know, should I work on this\n[12:36] chapter? Should I work on something else\n[12:37] or whatever. So, what I've started to do\n[12:39] is sometimes I will write the first\n[12:41] sentence of what I'm going to write and\n[12:42] just leave it on the Google doc right\n[12:44] there and then leave. And the next day\n[12:46] when I come back, I'm already in, right?\n[12:48] Like it's already the first sentence is\n[12:50] already written. So now I'm just writing\n[12:51] the next piece of what's coming rather\n[12:53] than trying to choose what to write\n[12:55] about.\n[12:56] >> Another one that I've done sometimes is\n[12:57] I will write sometimes I'll write the\n[12:59] topic or I'll write the sentence on a\n[13:00] post-it note and I'll put it on top of\n[13:02] the keyboard and so when I come into the\n[13:04] office it's right there in front of I\n[13:05] can't you know I got to pick it off the\n[13:07] keys to log onto the computer and so\n[13:10] it's like remember this is what you're\n[13:11] writing about right now you know so it's\n[13:13] just trying to make it easy to get in. I\n[13:14] have a bunch of readers who do stuff\n[13:16] like set their running out running\n[13:17] clothes out the night before, you know,\n[13:18] so they're right next to the bed. You\n[13:20] got your clothes and your shoes there. I\n[13:21] one woman I just talked to uh her at an\n[13:23] event. She came up afterward and she\n[13:25] said, \"I actually sleep in my running\n[13:26] clothes and just get out and get put her\n[13:28] shoes on and goes right out the door.\"\n[13:30] But you're trying to prime the\n[13:31] environment to make the action easy.\n[13:32] Okay. So, how can you set up the spaces\n[13:34] that you're in uh to prime those habits?\n[13:37] I think one really interesting question\n[13:38] to ask, walk into the rooms where you\n[13:41] spend most of your time each day, your\n[13:43] office, your living room, your bedroom,\n[13:45] and then look around and ask yourself,\n[13:47] what is this space designed to\n[13:49] encourage? What behaviors are easy here?\n[13:51] What behaviors are obvious here? And the\n[13:54] good habits that you say you want to\n[13:56] build, are those the path of least\n[13:57] resistance? Is that the obvious thing in\n[13:59] this environment? And if not, maybe you\n[14:01] can make some adjustments to try to make\n[14:02] the good habit easier and the\n[14:04] distractions maybe a little bit harder.\n[14:06] So that's first thing, prime the\n[14:07] environment to make the action easy.\n[14:09] Second thing is if there's like one\n[14:12] principle that is probably the single\n[14:14] most important for building habits, it's\n[14:15] make it easy. Just scale it down and\n[14:18] make it easy. I refer to it sometimes as\n[14:20] the two-minute rule. So take whatever\n[14:22] habit you're trying to work on, you\n[14:23] scale it down to something that takes\n[14:24] two minutes or less to do. Read 30 books\n[14:27] a year becomes read one page or do yoga\n[14:30] four days a week becomes take out my\n[14:32] yoga mat.\n[14:33] Sometimes I will mention this to people\n[14:35] and they resist it a little bit. You\n[14:36] know, they're like, \"Okay, buddy.\" Like,\n[14:38] I know the real goal isn't just to take\n[14:39] my yoga mat out. You know, I know I'm\n[14:41] actually trying to do the workout. So,\n[14:42] this is some kind of mental trick and I\n[14:44] know it's a trick. Then why would I fall\n[14:45] for it? Basically, but there's this guy,\n[14:48] I mentioned him in Atomic Habits, his\n[14:49] name is Mitch. And he went to the gym\n[14:52] and for the first six weeks, he had this\n[14:54] strange little rule for himself where he\n[14:56] wasn't allowed to stay for longer than 5\n[14:58] minutes. So, you get in the car, drive\n[15:00] to the gym, get out, do half an\n[15:01] exercise, get back in the car, drive\n[15:03] home. And you're like, \"This sounds\n[15:05] silly, right? Clearly, this is not going\n[15:07] to get the guy the results that he\n[15:08] wants.\" But what you realize is that he\n[15:11] was mastering the art of showing up,\n[15:13] right? He was becoming the type of\n[15:14] person that went to the gym four days a\n[15:16] week, even if it was only for five\n[15:17] minutes. And so, I think this is kind of\n[15:20] a deep truth about habits, which is a\n[15:23] habit must be established before it can\n[15:25] be improved. you know, has to become the\n[15:27] standard in your life before you\n[15:28] optimize and scale it up into something\n[15:29] more. There's that quote from Ed\n[15:32] Latimore where he says, \"The heaviest\n[15:34] weight at the gym is the front door.\"\n[15:36] There are a lot of things in life that\n[15:37] are like that. And so, by trying to make\n[15:40] it easy to master, to easy to get\n[15:42] started, um then you're in the game now.\n[15:45] You're in the arena. There's all kinds\n[15:46] of things you can improve from there. I\n[15:48] remember um Jordan Peterson saying\n[15:50] talking about his some of his clinical\n[15:52] um patients and referring to one in\n[15:54] particular who was in a room full of\n[15:56] junk and couldn't leave the room because\n[15:58] of a certain fear and certain\n[16:00] psychological problems he had. And\n[16:02] Jordan saying that day one they just\n[16:03] brought the Hoover into the room and\n[16:05] that was it. Day two they plugged the\n[16:07] Hoover in and that was it. And then by\n[16:09] day like 30 the guy is out of the room,\n[16:11] the room is clean and he's walking\n[16:13] around outside for the first time in in\n[16:14] months or years. And he goes on to say\n[16:17] that the reason why people don't get\n[16:18] started is because the first step is so\n[16:20] embarrassing. People think that it's not\n[16:22] worth it or that it's like shameful to\n[16:24] do. It's like almost like patronizingly\n[16:26] embarrassing. And um I've always kept\n[16:28] that in mind uh since then and when from\n[16:30] your work as well just that assume the\n[16:32] first steps are like embarrassingly\n[16:34] small.\n[16:35] >> There's this process called habit\n[16:36] shaping which is is basically like that.\n[16:39] Um, you know, like if you want to run a\n[16:40] half marathon, the first day the step\n[16:42] might be to put on your running shoes\n[16:44] and then the second day the step is to\n[16:45] like walk outside the front door and the\n[16:47] third day the step is to go around the\n[16:48] block. And you know, you're just like\n[16:50] gradually shaping into this this larger\n[16:51] habit. But there's this thing that\n[16:54] happens when people think about building\n[16:56] better habits. I think particularly\n[16:58] ambitious people, it's very easy to get\n[17:01] excited about all the changes you can\n[17:02] make. You start thinking, even if you\n[17:04] don't say this explicitly, you think\n[17:05] like, what would peak performance look\n[17:07] like? you know, if I could really get my\n[17:08] habits dialed in, what could I do? And\n[17:10] you start imagining five, six, seven\n[17:12] things that you would do and what all of\n[17:13] them would look like in their perfect\n[17:14] form and so on. And I think instead of\n[17:18] asking ourselves, what could I do on my\n[17:20] best day, it's better to start by asking\n[17:22] what can I stick to even on the bad\n[17:24] days? And that becomes your baseline.\n[17:26] That becomes the first step. And now\n[17:28] that you have this floor that is\n[17:30] achievable even when you're tired, even\n[17:32] when you're exhausted, even when you\n[17:33] don't have much time, now you can show\n[17:36] up and feel like you're succeeding, you\n[17:38] know, and then you can progress from\n[17:39] there. One of the most motivating\n[17:41] feelings to the human mind is a feeling\n[17:42] of progress. If you feel like you're\n[17:44] making progress, even if it's smaller\n[17:46] than what you ultimately hope to do, you\n[17:48] have every reason to move forward. But\n[17:50] often we become like a victim of our\n[17:51] expectations. We ex we spend all this\n[17:53] time optimizing the perfect plan and\n[17:55] then expect things to go perfectly out\n[17:57] of the gate and you had it so built up\n[17:59] in your mind that once you don't hit\n[18:01] that mark in the f first or second or\n[18:02] third day it falls apart.\n[18:05] >> And you talked earlier on about sitting\n[18:08] there for two hours thinking about what\n[18:10] to write. I I think I've learned through\n[18:12] through business and in the first\n[18:13] iteration of my career where I worked\n[18:14] with CEOs and executives that were\n[18:16] planning marketing campaigns that\n[18:18] actually in hindsight often the biggest\n[18:20] cost wasn't being wrong. It was the time\n[18:22] you waste making a decision. You see\n[18:23] this if you've ever you've interacted\n[18:25] with so many big corporations. Yeah.\n[18:26] Like they spend 18 months thinking about\n[18:29] >> get waiting for Joanna to come back from\n[18:30] annual leave to get procurement to sign\n[18:32] off the thing. And I worked with this\n[18:34] one particular founder during that\n[18:36] season of my life who where I was\n[18:37] working with his dad and him and his dad\n[18:40] would take nine months because the\n[18:41] company was so big. His son would\n[18:44] interrupt me halfway through the idea\n[18:45] and call us all in and say do it now.\n[18:48] And he taught me that actually in life\n[18:50] that the biggest cost is the time you\n[18:51] waste making the decision. And I think\n[18:53] about that with my own habits. I think\n[18:55] sometimes sitting around thinking about\n[18:56] whether I'm going to run today is\n[18:58] costing me much more than just [ __ ]\n[19:00] And do you think about how you kill that\n[19:02] mental debate? Like is that an effective\n[19:04] strategy to try and kill the debate and\n[19:05] not make a decision per se?\n[19:06] >> Yeah. So speed is perpetually\n[19:08] undervalued. That's for sure. Life is\n[19:10] short and so the sooner that you make\n[19:12] decisions, the sooner you get\n[19:13] information. Now, I will say I I have a\n[19:16] little framework that I call hats,\n[19:17] haircuts, and tattoos. And this is how\n[19:19] how I kind of think about it. So, a lot\n[19:22] of decisions are like hats. Just try you\n[19:24] try one hat. If you don't like it, take\n[19:25] it off. You can try another. It's just\n[19:27] real quick. You you know, you get some\n[19:28] information. Speed is most important.\n[19:30] Move quickly, get some information,\n[19:32] learn something. If it was wrong, it's\n[19:33] not that big of a deal. Just take it off\n[19:35] and put a new hat on. Haircut is a\n[19:37] little bit trickier. It's a It's a\n[19:39] decision that you have to live with for\n[19:41] a little bit. you know, like you're okay\n[19:42] if you get a bad haircut, but you're\n[19:44] gonna you're gonna have to live with it\n[19:45] for a month or two. You know, it's it's\n[19:46] going to take a little bit of time for\n[19:47] it to grow out. And so, it's probably\n[19:50] not a big deal to be scared of getting a\n[19:51] bad haircut. I think a lot of people\n[19:53] probably talk themselves out of it. It's\n[19:54] like, you'll be fine in a month. It's\n[19:55] it's fine. Tattoos are trickier. You\n[19:58] know, you get a tattoo, you got to live\n[19:59] with that choice. It's permanent. And\n[20:01] so, if a really what we're getting at\n[20:03] here is, is the choice reversible or is\n[20:05] the choice irreversible? If the choice\n[20:07] is easy to reverse, speed is most\n[20:09] important. You should move fast. If it's\n[20:11] hard to reverse and you got to live with\n[20:13] it, then you need to think carefully\n[20:14] before you make the call. Um, and I\n[20:17] think probably what you're seeing uh\n[20:18] through some of your experiences is that\n[20:20] most decisions in life are hats and\n[20:22] haircuts. It's very rare that you end up\n[20:24] with a tattoo,\n[20:24] >> but we treat them all like tattoos.\n[20:26] >> We Yeah, we uh I think in particular we\n[20:29] are we are scared, particularly the bad\n[20:32] haircuts. I think the ones that like\n[20:34] linger for just a little bit, but not\n[20:35] that long. It's like it's going to take\n[20:37] you a month to fix this if if you get it\n[20:38] wrong, but like that's fine. a month's\n[20:40] going to pass anyway. Um, and so it's\n[20:42] not that big of a deal, but we we act\n[20:44] like it's a bigger deal than it is.\n[20:46] >> Is there a particular case study or\n[20:47] story from a Atomic Habits community\n[20:50] member or someone that reads your\n[20:51] newsletter\n[20:53] that has been the most impactful for\n[20:54] you?\n[20:56] >> There's not a single one. There are lots\n[20:58] that I'm like proud of or really excited\n[20:59] by, ones I'm surprised by. Um, I heard\n[21:03] from a guy the other day, he was the\n[21:04] head coach at St. Olaf's University in\n[21:06] Minnesota and men's soccer. And when he\n[21:10] came in, their record was something like\n[21:11] five and 13 and they were, you know,\n[21:13] like near the bottom of the standings.\n[21:15] And he was like, I read Atomic Habits\n[21:18] right around the time I took this job.\n[21:19] And we came up with systems for\n[21:21] everything we did. We taught our players\n[21:22] systems for how they tie their shoes and\n[21:24] cleats to get ready for the game. We\n[21:26] taught them systems for how they prepped\n[21:28] for practice. We taught them systems for\n[21:29] their role on the field. And uh, you\n[21:31] know, gradually they improved each year,\n[21:33] five and 13. Then they went like eight\n[21:34] and eight. And then the next year after\n[21:36] that they won the conference. And then\n[21:37] the year after that they went to the\n[21:38] NCAA Sweet 16 and then five years later\n[21:40] they won the national championship. You\n[21:42] know, of course stuff like that's\n[21:43] awesome to hear about, right? You're\n[21:44] like they went from they went from five\n[21:46] wins uh in and then in five years later\n[21:49] they win the national title. But the\n[21:51] ones that matter to me the most are the\n[21:53] ones that I hear from somebody and they\n[21:56] say um I finally feel better. You know,\n[22:00] I feel different. I look in the mirror\n[22:01] and I'm like proud of who I am or uh my\n[22:03] kids tell me that they're excited to\n[22:05] see, you know, the change in me or\n[22:06] things like that. And that's what it's\n[22:08] always been about, you know, it's always\n[22:09] been about becoming the type of person\n[22:11] that you want to be. And so I think uh\n[22:13] anytime I I hear stories like that, I\n[22:15] think it's exciting.\n[22:16] >> So when this um was it a coach or was it\n[22:18] >> Yeah, Travis Wall is the head coach at\n[22:20] St. Olaf's. Um he's the head coach at\n[22:22] Kenyon. Uh now,\n[22:23] >> so he talked about systems there. Most\n[22:25] of us think about to-do lists and goals\n[22:27] and those kinds of things. What what is\n[22:29] the difference between a system and a\n[22:31] goal?\n[22:31] >> I was very goal driven for a long time.\n[22:33] I I mean, I probably still am. You know,\n[22:34] I don't think there's any way to get\n[22:36] around the fact that we all have goals\n[22:38] and think about the outcomes we want and\n[22:39] so on. But a goal is about the outcome\n[22:42] that you want to achieve and a system is\n[22:44] about the process for getting there. And\n[22:46] so your goal is the target, the outcome,\n[22:48] the thing you're shooting for. Your\n[22:50] system is the collection of daily habits\n[22:53] that you follow. And if there is ever a\n[22:55] gap between your goal and your system,\n[22:58] if there's ever a gap between your\n[22:59] desired outcome and your daily habits,\n[23:02] your daily habits will always win,\n[23:05] >> you know. And so almost by definition,\n[23:07] your current habits are perfectly\n[23:09] designed to deliver your current\n[23:11] results. You know, if you want to see\n[23:13] like where you're going to end up, just\n[23:14] follow the trajectory of your habits.\n[23:16] you know what's the process you've been\n[23:17] running for the last 6 months or year or\n[23:19] two years and they've carried you almost\n[23:21] inevitably to the outcomes that you have\n[23:23] right now I'm not saying that habits are\n[23:25] the only thing that matter in life right\n[23:27] like strategy matters luck randomness uh\n[23:30] those misfortune those things can\n[23:32] influence the outcome but by definition\n[23:35] luck and randomness are not under your\n[23:38] control\n[23:38] >> and your habits are and the only\n[23:40] reasonable rational approach in life is\n[23:42] to focus on the pieces that are within\n[23:44] your control so I think goals can be\n[23:47] good for setting a sense of direction.\n[23:48] They're good for clarity. You know,\n[23:50] especially if you have a team, get\n[23:51] everybody rowing in the same direction.\n[23:53] But once you've decided what the goal\n[23:55] is, you should basically set it on the\n[23:58] shelf, metaphorically speaking, and\n[23:59] spend the vast majority of your time\n[24:01] focused on building a better system. How\n[24:02] are the habits we're executing each day\n[24:04] moving us closer to this outcome that we\n[24:06] want? And so where I've come after\n[24:08] talking about this for five or six years\n[24:10] now since book's been out, where I've\n[24:12] come down on it is goals are best for\n[24:15] people who care about winning once.\n[24:16] Systems are best for people who care\n[24:18] about winning repeatedly. If you really\n[24:20] want to make progress again and again,\n[24:21] if you want to get to the top and stay\n[24:22] at the top, you need some process for\n[24:25] staying up there. Some collection of\n[24:27] habits that's going to keep uh this\n[24:28] machine running. So this is why, you\n[24:31] know, I say in the book, we don't rise\n[24:33] to level of our goals, we fall to level\n[24:35] of our systems. As you were talking, I\n[24:37] was thinking so much about about\n[24:38] business and founders and entrepreneurs\n[24:40] because they all have big goals. We want\n[24:43] to build the best AI app or the best I\n[24:46] don't know restaurant and we they stay\n[24:48] really focused on those. But the great\n[24:50] the greatest founders that I think I've\n[24:51] met and interviewed on this show are\n[24:53] actually really orientated on like what\n[24:54] you call in the book first principles\n[24:56] and systems. Mhm.\n[24:58] >> Is there a way to to become more\n[25:00] orientated towards systems and and\n[25:02] thinking about first principles like the\n[25:04] the habits that lead to the goal is or\n[25:06] is it just just so that some people have\n[25:08] it cuz like Elon Musk is always talking\n[25:11] about first principles and he thinks in\n[25:12] terms of building the system. I do think\n[25:14] some of it is personality and like what\n[25:16] you what's exciting to you to think\n[25:18] about like some people are very future\n[25:20] oriented and like thinking about what\n[25:21] the systems are and what that would lead\n[25:23] them to and and so on um or more\n[25:25] processoriented but there are a number\n[25:27] of questions that you can ask that can\n[25:29] help you figure out like what systems\n[25:31] you should be focused on you know so\n[25:33] like a couple of the ones I like one\n[25:35] question is can my current habits carry\n[25:37] me to my desired future so you have a\n[25:39] bunch of habits you're following right\n[25:40] now what what path are you on you know\n[25:43] can your current habits take you there?\n[25:44] And they could be either way. Like\n[25:46] sometimes the answer is yes. And what\n[25:48] you need is patience. You just need to\n[25:49] keep, you know, staying on the path. But\n[25:51] sometimes the answer is no. And then\n[25:53] obviously something needs to change. You\n[25:54] know, you're hoping for one outcome, but\n[25:56] then you're following a different\n[25:57] lifestyle.\n[25:58] >> So to want the outcome without the\n[25:59] lifestyle is to like torture yourself.\n[26:01] And what really matters is not do you\n[26:04] want the the result. Anybody would like\n[26:06] the result if you just hand it to them.\n[26:08] The question is do you want the\n[26:09] lifestyle? One of the little things I\n[26:11] try to do whenever I have a new business\n[26:12] project that I'm thinking about or\n[26:13] something I'm I'm excited about\n[26:14] potentially doing, the first question I\n[26:17] ask is how do I want to spend my days?\n[26:19] And so then you like draw a box and\n[26:21] inside that box, how can we make the\n[26:24] most money, reach the most people, make\n[26:26] the biggest impact, you know, make the\n[26:28] contribution that you want to make, but\n[26:29] not outside of it. And what happens a\n[26:31] lot of the time is people do that in\n[26:32] reverse. They start by asking how can we\n[26:34] make the most money or reach the most\n[26:36] people or make the biggest impact and\n[26:38] then they decide oh well this is what I\n[26:39] want to do but it's actually outside of\n[26:42] how they want to spend their days\n[26:43] >> and it's not going to work out well\n[26:45] because you know it goes back to our\n[26:46] point uh previously about is this fun\n[26:48] you know if the if they don't want to\n[26:50] spend their time that way you're just\n[26:51] grinding for a little while and\n[26:52] eventually it's not going to work.\n[26:53] That's the key for building systems that\n[26:56] really work is is this how you want to\n[26:57] spend your days. the person who wants to\n[26:59] live the lifestyle is much better\n[27:01] positioned to get the result.\n[27:03] >> You say that um there are multiple\n[27:05] problems with with goals as a I guess as\n[27:08] a rubric for thinking about what to do\n[27:10] or what to aim for. One of them is that\n[27:13] winners and losers have the same goals.\n[27:16] >> Everybody wants the results. Let's say\n[27:17] you have a 100 people apply for a job.\n[27:19] You got a new job opening.\n[27:20] >> Presumably, every candidate has the goal\n[27:22] of getting the job. The goal is not the\n[27:24] thing that determines the outcome. So\n[27:26] the person who wins and the 99 people\n[27:28] who lose, they have the same goals. You\n[27:29] look at the Olympic Games, presumably\n[27:31] any event, everybody who's competing has\n[27:33] the goal of winning the Olympic medal,\n[27:35] right? Of winning the gold. So the goal\n[27:37] is not the thing that makes the\n[27:38] difference. So again, winners and losers\n[27:40] have the same goals. So if they have the\n[27:42] same goals, they cannot be the thing\n[27:44] that make the difference in their\n[27:45] performance. It has to be something\n[27:46] else. Maybe having a goal is part of it.\n[27:48] Maybe it's necessary, but it's not\n[27:50] sufficient for the outcome that you\n[27:52] want. And for that, what you need is a\n[27:54] system. You need a collection of habits\n[27:55] that are going to make the difference um\n[27:57] and uh and accumulate into a bigger\n[27:59] outcome.\n[27:59] >> And you say goals restrict your\n[28:01] happiness.\n[28:02] >> There's some implicit promise internally\n[28:04] that once I get to this goal, then I'll\n[28:06] be happy. You know, once I write a New\n[28:08] York Times bestseller, then I'll feel\n[28:09] better about it. You know, once I\n[28:12] achieve this certain number on the\n[28:13] scale, then I'll be happy with my body.\n[28:15] Once I get to a million dollars in\n[28:17] revenue, then I'll be happy with the\n[28:18] business. And so you're kind of\n[28:20] constantly pushing happiness off to the\n[28:23] next milestone and thinking that once\n[28:25] you get there, then finally you'll be\n[28:26] satisfied. But I think in fact the\n[28:29] better way to do it is to fall in love\n[28:32] with the process, to fall in love with\n[28:33] the lifestyle, then you can be happy\n[28:35] along the way and still achieve the\n[28:37] goals as you go, still achieve the\n[28:39] milestones. For a long time, I wrestled\n[28:41] I had trouble with this question of do I\n[28:42] have to be dissatisfied if I want to be\n[28:44] driven?\n[28:45] >> Yeah.\n[28:45] >> Do you have to be dissatisfied to be\n[28:46] driven? Because to me, I felt like\n[28:50] there's where I'm at right now and\n[28:51] there's where I want to be. And so\n[28:53] there's this gap and there that gap is\n[28:55] dissatisfaction. That gap is, you know,\n[28:57] you're you want it to change. You want\n[28:59] it to close. And it's also what is\n[29:01] motivating and driving you is to try to\n[29:03] close that gap. And so the healthiest\n[29:07] answer, maybe the answer is yes, I don't\n[29:09] know. But uh the healthiest answer that\n[29:11] I've come up with is imagine like an\n[29:13] acorn falls from a tree. it manages to\n[29:15] take root, becomes a seedling and then a\n[29:17] sapling and eventually grows into this\n[29:19] mature oak tree. And at no point in that\n[29:22] process when it was just an acorn, it\n[29:23] wasn't criticizing itself for not being\n[29:25] a sapling. You know, it was just a\n[29:26] sapling, it wasn't criticizing itself\n[29:27] for not being an oak. Um, it wasn't\n[29:29] dissatisfied with where it was at. And\n[29:31] nobody came over and was criticizing it\n[29:33] for, \"Oh, I can't believe you're not a\n[29:34] full-grown tree yet.\" But it kept\n[29:37] growing the whole time. So\n[29:40] simultaneously you have this thing where\n[29:41] it was both perfect at each stage that\n[29:44] it was at. Nothing was wrong and yet it\n[29:46] continued to grow. And the reason is\n[29:48] because that's just what an oak tree\n[29:50] does. That's what it is encoded to do.\n[29:52] It is encoded for growth. And so when I\n[29:55] look at myself, I think if I put myself\n[29:57] in the right position, that's how I feel\n[29:59] about it. You know, I I am perfectly\n[30:02] happy with where I'm at at each stage.\n[30:04] And yet I'm encoded to grow, right? I'm\n[30:07] encoded to keep going. And so I can both\n[30:09] be driven and be satisfied. I can both\n[30:12] be appreciative of the moment and still\n[30:14] moving forward. And I think that works\n[30:16] best when you find that thing. Sometimes\n[30:18] we call it your strengths. Sometimes we\n[30:20] might say it's what you're encoded to\n[30:22] do. Uh but when you find that thing that\n[30:24] is well aligned for you and if you do\n[30:26] find that, then you can have both of\n[30:28] those.\n[30:28] >> I love that. I love that. And I think\n[30:30] with with age and maturity, I've gotten\n[30:32] closer to being in that region where I'm\n[30:34] well aware nothing is going to make me\n[30:36] happier at all. like no accomplishment\n[30:37] future nothing's going to change\n[30:38] anything\n[30:39] >> but at the same time I'm still striving\n[30:42] and that does feel like a contradiction\n[30:43] to some degree it feels like how can\n[30:45] those two things be true at the same\n[30:46] time that you're striving for things\n[30:47] that you know won't really move the\n[30:49] needle in any any way the difference I\n[30:52] see between like me and something in\n[30:55] nature is that I the thing in nature\n[30:58] probably isn't comparing itself on\n[30:59] Instagram to like\n[31:00] >> everyone else and I understand humans to\n[31:03] be like comparison machines kind of how\n[31:04] we understand the value of things like I\n[31:06] understand the value of the steak on a\n[31:08] menu by the the cheap steak and the most\n[31:10] expensive one. So I think the middle one\n[31:11] is probably right. Do you think much\n[31:13] about comparison as a motivating or\n[31:16] demotivating force in this picture?\n[31:18] >> I think it can be very helpful and also\n[31:20] it can also be very harmful. So it's\n[31:21] just sort of a a sense of how you use\n[31:23] it. I tend to find it better if you\n[31:25] compare small things. So if you compare\n[31:27] marketing strategies or squat form or\n[31:29] you know writing style or you know the\n[31:31] first sentence of each chapter like how\n[31:32] do I have a good intro? If you compare\n[31:34] tactics, then that can be really helpful\n[31:36] for building skills and for developing\n[31:38] your ability. If you compare big things,\n[31:40] marriage, net worth, you know, things\n[31:42] like that, it's like that's just kind of\n[31:44] a recipe for ending up unhappy. Um\n[31:46] because they as the scale gets bigger,\n[31:48] things get more vague. There's so many\n[31:51] things involved in marriage and so you\n[31:53] know, or net worth or whatever. You you\n[31:55] just see one little slice and you are\n[31:56] trying to compare these two big things,\n[31:58] but you don't even know what the full\n[31:59] picture is. Uh, and so comparison is\n[32:02] like the teacher of skills when it's\n[32:03] applied narrowly, but it's the thief of\n[32:06] joy when it's applied broadly.\n[32:08] >> That makes sense. Yeah.\n[32:09] >> Early on, when you said that, you know,\n[32:11] ambitious people, they have lots of\n[32:12] aspirations, lots of habits they want to\n[32:13] start. I was thinking about myself and\n[32:15] thinking there's probably 30 habits that\n[32:18] I would like to acquire. I'd want to be\n[32:19] better at writing. I want to be a\n[32:20] runner. I want to be better at speaking.\n[32:22] I want to be a better friend and be more\n[32:25] um attentive with my friends and make\n[32:27] sure I text them on their birthdays and\n[32:28] sh you know\n[32:29] >> all of these new habits that I want to\n[32:31] pursue. How does one know which one to\n[32:34] aim for first? Is there a framework for\n[32:36] knowing?\n[32:36] >> Yeah, there there's some things that you\n[32:38] can do. I don't think um to your point\n[32:40] earlier about uh sometimes the riskiest\n[32:43] things just take a long time making a\n[32:44] decision. You know, if you maybe you\n[32:46] should just pick one and work on it and\n[32:47] then you can get on to the next one. But\n[32:48] I do think there's some level of\n[32:50] strategy which is a good place to start\n[32:52] is by asking yourself which habits are\n[32:54] upstream from other good things\n[32:56] happening. So for example I know that if\n[33:00] you were maybe the maybe the question to\n[33:02] start with is when you live a good day\n[33:03] when you feel dialed in when things are\n[33:05] like rolling along well for you what\n[33:07] tends to be part of that day sleep. you\n[33:09] know, okay, great. So, that's, you know,\n[33:11] I would say for me, sleep, sleep is\n[33:12] definitely one. I would say, uh, getting\n[33:14] my workout in. And usually reading and\n[33:17] writing are a part of it, but I think I\n[33:18] could just boil it down to reading. If I\n[33:20] just read like 10 pages, that often\n[33:23] sparks the writing. So, like to me,\n[33:25] reading is like the fuel for writing for\n[33:26] me. So, so I could say get a workout in\n[33:28] and read for 5 minutes or 10 minutes.\n[33:30] Those are the two things that are part\n[33:31] of a good day. And what happens is\n[33:34] they're upstream from a lot of other\n[33:36] good things happening. For example, if I\n[33:37] get the workout in, yeah, I feel good. I\n[33:39] get the benefits of the workout, but I\n[33:41] also have a post-workout high for like\n[33:43] an hour or two. So, I my focus and\n[33:45] concentration is better. I sleep better\n[33:47] at night because I got the workout in.\n[33:49] Now, I'm tired.\n[33:50] >> I tend to eat better when I work out.\n[33:51] It's when I'm not working out that I eat\n[33:53] terribly. That's why I don't know. It's\n[33:55] kind of like I don't want to waste it or\n[33:56] something. So, at no point was I trying\n[33:59] to build better focus habits or sleep\n[34:01] habits or nutrition habits. those just\n[34:02] came kind of a na as a natural\n[34:04] consequence of getting the workout in.\n[34:06] >> So what are those things that you do\n[34:08] that are upstream from other good things\n[34:10] happening? I think those are good like\n[34:12] anchor habits to start and focus on.\n[34:15] >> But if I could add another one for\n[34:17] myself, I would say it's a little bit of\n[34:19] time. It's really just time to think,\n[34:20] but it's it's time to reflect and\n[34:22] review. There's this interesting thing\n[34:23] that happens if you if you have a really\n[34:25] good work ethic, if you have a strong\n[34:26] work ethic and working hard has gotten\n[34:28] you far in life. It kind of becomes a\n[34:32] crutch. You know, you for for a long\n[34:34] time I was like, if I ever had a\n[34:35] problem, I was like, well, I'll just\n[34:36] work my way out of it, you know? I'll\n[34:38] just just work harder on it until I\n[34:39] figure it out. And that that's great.\n[34:42] That's really powerful for a lot of\n[34:43] things. But at some point it breaks, you\n[34:46] know, like you can maybe if you really\n[34:47] try maybe you can work 10% harder or 20%\n[34:50] harder, but there's some limit. But if\n[34:52] you work on the right thing, well, you\n[34:54] could get 100x the result or thousandx\n[34:55] the result. And so if you just keep your\n[34:58] head down and work hard, it's very\n[35:00] unlikely that you'll be spending your\n[35:02] time in the highest and best way.\n[35:04] >> And the only way to figure that out is\n[35:06] to have time to reflect and review. Time\n[35:08] to think, you know, so you need enough\n[35:10] time to think to figure out what should\n[35:12] I be focused on next. And so I think\n[35:14] that is it's almost reflection and\n[35:17] review is almost like the meta habit\n[35:19] that is above all others because if you\n[35:21] give yourself time to reflect and review\n[35:23] then you can troubleshoot your habits\n[35:24] and figure out how to adjust them. I was\n[35:26] thinking as you were saying that that\n[35:27] that that time to reflect and review is\n[35:29] actually also a review of are my current\n[35:32] systems moving me closer because when\n[35:34] when when you're talking about that I\n[35:36] was thinking of times in my life where I\n[35:37] was so close to like the picture and I\n[35:39] was so in the trenches doing the thing\n[35:40] that I hadn't come up to even say\n[35:42] actually is there a system I could put\n[35:44] in place to solve this problem over the\n[35:46] next five or 10 years like for example\n[35:48] is there a person I need to hire so\n[35:50] actually should I go into the hiring\n[35:51] process versus be in there fixing the\n[35:53] problem myself should I spend 10 hours\n[35:55] this week hire on hiring a candidate to\n[35:58] do this or should I be doing it but\n[35:59] sometimes you get so caught up in the\n[36:01] trenches when especially when things are\n[36:02] tough and and difficult and moving very\n[36:04] quickly that you don't review your\n[36:06] systems and also when you're talking\n[36:07] about systems I thought about how\n[36:08] systems sometimes expire.\n[36:10] >> Sure. Yeah.\n[36:11] >> Because things change.\n[36:12] >> That's a great point and I think this is\n[36:14] probably one of the most overlooked\n[36:15] things with habits. A lot of the time\n[36:17] when someone sits down and they want to\n[36:18] build a new habit, they don't say this,\n[36:19] but what they kind of assume is what it\n[36:21] would mean to be successful with this\n[36:23] habit is that I do it for the rest of my\n[36:25] life, you know, and that if at some\n[36:27] point I'm not doing it, then that must\n[36:28] mean that I failed or I quit on it.\n[36:31] >> But that's not how it is at all. Like\n[36:33] things have a season, you know, and so\n[36:35] habits have to change shape over time.\n[36:38] >> Let's take my um my writing habit for\n[36:39] example. I the habit that launched my\n[36:42] career was I wrote a new article every\n[36:44] Monday and Thursday and I did that for\n[36:45] three years. So the first three years\n[36:47] 150 articles you know write twice a\n[36:49] week. That was a great habit. They were\n[36:51] like 2,000 word pieces or so. But then I\n[36:53] signed the book deal for Atomic Habits.\n[36:54] I didn't have the capacity to do that\n[36:56] and also write the book. So that had to\n[36:58] change. I wrote the book for like three\n[36:59] years and then the book came out and now\n[37:01] I write a newsletter once a week and\n[37:03] that's much shorter. But I kind of feel\n[37:06] like my writing habit is maintained that\n[37:08] whole time. It just changed shape. But\n[37:09] that's fine. It just needed to shift\n[37:11] based on the season. But I don't know,\n[37:12] people, they get so attached to one form\n[37:15] of a habit sometimes that they don't\n[37:17] realize that it's no longer serving\n[37:19] them.\n[37:20] >> And I think that's the one of the\n[37:21] trickier things to give up is a habit\n[37:23] that used to be good for you, that used\n[37:25] to work well, but no longer serves you\n[37:27] in your current season. It's I find that\n[37:29] I'm kind of a slow learner with that. I\n[37:31] guess parents can probably really relate\n[37:32] because they're forced to basically\n[37:34] change their goals and therefore their\n[37:36] systems would have to I mean you're a\n[37:38] father of three so you probably know\n[37:40] this much better than I do but have has\n[37:42] there been systems that you've had to\n[37:44] sort of\n[37:44] >> I think there's lots of uh inflection\n[37:46] points in life so having kids is one of\n[37:48] them uh starting a new job moving to a\n[37:50] new city you know it can be big stuff\n[37:52] like that I just talked to a mother who\n[37:54] her kids moved out so she's now an empty\n[37:56] neester you know she's like last 25\n[37:57] years I've been parenting all these kids\n[37:58] and now finally they're all out, but it\n[38:01] feels in some sense it almost feels like\n[38:03] a loss of identity. You know, you're\n[38:04] like, I I thought I was one thing and\n[38:06] now, you know, feels like things have\n[38:07] shifted. Um, but also it just signals an\n[38:10] inflection point in life and a new\n[38:11] season that you're in. And when your\n[38:12] seasons change, your habits often need\n[38:14] to change with it. And you talk about\n[38:16] this um four burners theory which I\n[38:18] guess dovetailes into what we're talking\n[38:19] about here where you you use this to\n[38:22] kind of think about what habits to\n[38:24] pursue in any season of life but also a\n[38:26] phrase that I've heard um so often\n[38:28] specifically from mothers on the show\n[38:31] comes to mind which is that you can't\n[38:33] have it all at the same time\n[38:34] >> and I've heard that I think four or five\n[38:36] times different mothers in particular\n[38:37] which is I mean says something about\n[38:38] society yeah have said to me that\n[38:40] they've had to realize that they can't\n[38:41] have it all at the same time\n[38:42] >> for sure. So this is not my concept.\n[38:45] This this idea that I came across. It's\n[38:47] called the four burners theory. And it\n[38:49] breaks life into these four burners on a\n[38:51] stove. So you have work and career as\n[38:53] one. You have family, friends, and then\n[38:55] personal health or you know uh yourself\n[38:58] basically as the other. The idea is that\n[39:00] for the burners to really be going well,\n[39:02] you can't have all four on at the same\n[39:04] time.\n[39:04] >> And burning stove.\n[39:06] >> The stove. Yeah. Yeah. The stove top. So\n[39:07] you you have you can choose you could\n[39:09] have three going on at kind of like a\n[39:11] mid level, but if you really want them\n[39:13] to do well, you can only have two on at\n[39:14] the same time. And you know, who knows?\n[39:17] I I don't know if it's true or not or\n[39:19] whatever, but it's an interesting idea.\n[39:20] And what it does is it gets you to\n[39:22] realize, yeah, a fundamental part of\n[39:24] life is trade-offs. And you cannot be\n[39:26] good at everything at the same time. So\n[39:28] this is true across projects. If you\n[39:30] choose try to do seven things at once,\n[39:31] spreading yourself thin in seven\n[39:33] different ways, very hard to be\n[39:34] excellent. For me, what I think about is\n[39:37] life has a series of seasons and life\n[39:40] has a series of sequences. So, let's say\n[39:43] it's not it's not always exactly 10\n[39:45] years, but let's say the big movements\n[39:47] in life are roughly 10-year buckets,\n[39:49] right? So, like for me, building my\n[39:50] first business, that was kind of like a\n[39:51] 10-year thing and eventually led to the\n[39:53] launch of Atomic Habits. You maybe get\n[39:55] five or six of those in your adult life.\n[39:57] Some of those things make sense to do in\n[39:59] a different order than others. Like if\n[40:02] you want to travel the world and see a\n[40:04] bunch of places and party in a visa,\n[40:05] you're probably not going to do that in\n[40:06] your 60s, you know? Like I mean, you\n[40:08] can. There's no nobody's saying you\n[40:09] can't, but some things are probably\n[40:11] better sequenced in other, you know, in\n[40:13] other spots. Obviously, there's, you\n[40:15] know, especially for women, there's a\n[40:16] certain limit on if you want to have a\n[40:17] family, what decades that happens in.\n[40:20] So, yeah, it's just uh it's just a\n[40:21] matter of sequencing and prioritization.\n[40:23] If you look at the like tapestry of your\n[40:25] life, what do you want the big movements\n[40:26] to be and where do those seasons need to\n[40:28] slot in? Um, yeah, it's a it's a that\n[40:32] there is no right answer, but it's\n[40:34] interesting. As soon as you realize it's\n[40:36] a finite number, and as soon as you\n[40:38] realize that trade-offs are always going\n[40:39] to be a reality,\n[40:41] >> you have to deal with that in some way.\n[40:42] Um, I've decided that right now while my\n[40:44] kids are young, like I'm I'm going to\n[40:46] turn the career burner down. And that's\n[40:47] fine. It's not going to be how it was\n[40:49] for the last 10 years. But that's okay\n[40:51] because they're only five once, you\n[40:52] know? They're only turning six once.\n[40:54] They only go to second grade once. And I\n[40:56] I want to be there for all that. So, um,\n[40:59] there are always trade-offs.\n[41:00] >> I think that that sequence point is\n[41:02] super super interesting. It got me\n[41:03] thinking because you're right, there are\n[41:04] sort of some constraints whether they're\n[41:06] biological constraints where in the case\n[41:07] of your kids like just natural\n[41:09] constraints that mean this this season\n[41:12] can only happen now here, right?\n[41:14] >> Yeah. There's also some things like um,\n[41:16] you know, both of us are fairly young\n[41:17] entrepreneurs. I'm so glad that I\n[41:20] started a business in my 20s rather than\n[41:22] my 50s. Um, doesn't mean you can't do it\n[41:24] in your 50s. There's no nobody's saying\n[41:25] you can't. It's just that it makes\n[41:27] things a lot easier for the next decade.\n[41:29] You know, it's easier for me to be there\n[41:30] for my kids now because I have control\n[41:32] of my time because I did the business\n[41:34] part in the previous decade. And so take\n[41:36] the risks.\n[41:37] >> Yeah. And and that doesn't mean it's\n[41:38] always going to work out or whatever. It\n[41:39] doesn't mean that you're going to be\n[41:40] able to perfectly plan it all, but you\n[41:43] just see how the sequences can um can\n[41:45] stack up in that way.\n[41:46] >> And how important do you think when\n[41:47] we're talking about habits, do you think\n[41:48] repetition is? because there's so many\n[41:50] of these sort of well-known concepts or\n[41:54] frameworks in habit formation. One of\n[41:56] them is that habits take roughly 66\n[41:58] days. One of them is that it's about\n[42:00] repetition. Does repetition really\n[42:02] matter?\n[42:02] >> It definitely does. I mean, repetition\n[42:04] is how habits form. Uh the 66 days\n[42:06] number comes from one study that came\n[42:08] out that found that on average it took\n[42:10] about 66 days to build a habit. If you\n[42:12] look at the study, the range is pretty\n[42:14] wide. So, if you pick something really\n[42:16] simple like drinking a glass of water um\n[42:18] at lunch each day, that might only take\n[42:21] two or three weeks to form. If you look\n[42:23] at something more complicated like um\n[42:25] going for a run after work every day,\n[42:27] that might take seven or eight or nine\n[42:28] months to form. And so, I don't know\n[42:30] that 66 days really tells you anything.\n[42:33] It doesn't it doesn't tell you that this\n[42:35] is how long it's going to take for your\n[42:36] habit to stick. I mean, it the range is\n[42:37] wide. Sometimes when people ask me how\n[42:40] long does it take to form a habit, my\n[42:42] answer is forever. Because if you stop\n[42:45] doing it, then it's no longer a habit.\n[42:47] And what I'm kind of getting at with\n[42:49] that is that habits are not a finish\n[42:51] line to be crossed. They're a lifestyle\n[42:53] to be lived, you know? And so we\n[42:55] approach our habits as if it's a finish\n[42:57] line. Oh, let me do this 30-day cleanse\n[42:58] and then I'll be healthy. Let me do this\n[43:00] 90-day sprint and then the product will\n[43:01] be shipped. I won't have to worry about\n[43:02] it anymore, you know? And it's like most\n[43:05] things in life, especially the big\n[43:06] important things, they're endless.\n[43:08] They're endless battles, you know. So,\n[43:10] just because you went to the gym\n[43:12] yesterday earns you no bo bonus points\n[43:14] for tomorrow. Like, you still have to\n[43:15] show up tomorrow. Just because you were\n[43:17] a good spouse yesterday earns you no\n[43:18] bonus points for tomorrow. You still\n[43:20] have to be loving and caring again. Um,\n[43:22] and so all the things that really matter\n[43:25] are endless battles. And it's not about\n[43:27] crossing a finish line. It's about\n[43:28] living that kind of lifestyle. And so,\n[43:30] yes, it is true that repetition matters.\n[43:33] And yes, it is true that the habits will\n[43:35] become more seamless and automatic and\n[43:38] maybe a little less effortful as you\n[43:40] repeat them more, but that doesn't mean\n[43:42] that you'll never have to think about\n[43:43] them or, you know, worry about them\n[43:44] again.\n[43:45] >> Do you think much about what's going on\n[43:46] in the brain when repetition occurs?\n[43:48] Like, what is it that's making it\n[43:49] easier? If I', if I've been on a on a\n[43:51] roll with the gym, I've been going for\n[43:52] 60 days in a row. Why does it feel\n[43:54] easier on day 61?\n[43:57] That's a tricky question because um if\n[44:00] you were to talk to an academic and they\n[44:02] would tell you like a habit is this\n[44:04] automatic non-concious behavior. Really\n[44:06] quick simple things like brushing your\n[44:08] teeth, tying your shoes, every time you\n[44:10] pick up a pair of barbecue tongs, you\n[44:12] got to tap them together twice, you\n[44:13] know, like stuff that you don't even\n[44:14] really think about. Okay, that's actual\n[44:17] habitual behavior. But if I were to ask\n[44:20] you, what are some habits you're trying\n[44:21] to build? you would say, \"I'm trying to\n[44:23] go to the gym four days a week or I'm\n[44:24] trying to write every morning or I'm\n[44:25] trying to meditate, you know, five days\n[44:27] a week or whatever.\" And I know what you\n[44:29] mean when you say that. You mean I want\n[44:31] it to be this routine, this practice\n[44:33] that I do consistently. But like writing\n[44:36] every day is never going to be mindless\n[44:38] the way that brushing your teeth is. You\n[44:39] know, going to the gym is not going to\n[44:41] be automatic the way that tying your\n[44:42] shoes might be. And so the things that\n[44:45] we there's a little bit of sloppiness in\n[44:47] the word habits and how we use it in\n[44:49] life. It's not they're not automatic\n[44:51] mindless routines most of the time. Most\n[44:53] of the things that we want to be habits\n[44:56] are not like reflexes. They're routines\n[44:58] and rituals that we do consistently.\n[45:00] >> So having said that, it is true that\n[45:03] after you've gone to the gym for a month\n[45:04] or two, it does start to get easier. And\n[45:06] I think there's a number of forces that\n[45:07] kind of work in your favor there. One is\n[45:10] you figured a lot out about uh what it\n[45:13] takes to get into the gym. What time am\n[45:15] I going? What route do I take? How do I\n[45:17] pack my bag? Do I need to bring a water\n[45:19] bottle or is there a water fountain at\n[45:20] the gym? Like all those sorts of things\n[45:22] are little one-time costs that you got\n[45:24] to figure out early on that once you're\n[45:26] into a pattern, you already know them.\n[45:28] >> You know, the water bottle thing sounds\n[45:30] like a small thing. I heard from someone\n[45:31] who said, \"I always forget to bring my\n[45:32] water bottle and they don't have water\n[45:33] fountains at this gym.\" So like I I\n[45:35] sometimes I skip the workout because of\n[45:37] that. You know, it's like it's\n[45:38] remarkable how little friction it takes\n[45:39] to pull us off course. Mhm.\n[45:41] >> And so figuring out all of those things\n[45:43] is something that once you're a month or\n[45:45] two in, you've crossed all you've, you\n[45:47] know, you've fought all those battles\n[45:48] and now you know how to do it. So that\n[45:50] makes it easier. The other thing is you\n[45:52] start to build friendships, start to\n[45:53] build connections, you start to know the\n[45:55] people there, you feel comfortable\n[45:56] there. There's this concept Steven\n[45:58] Presfield talks about where u you know\n[46:00] if you have a wolf and it's roaming\n[46:02] around uh eventually it starts to feel\n[46:04] like it has its territory and early on\n[46:07] in a process a creative process writing\n[46:09] a book or whatever you go into the\n[46:10] office the first time to write the first\n[46:11] chapter of the book and you kind of feel\n[46:13] uncomfortable it feels like it's not you\n[46:14] yet you go to the gym on the first day\n[46:16] you feel like people are judging you do\n[46:18] I look stupid I don't know how to do\n[46:19] this but after a while it becomes your\n[46:22] territory it's just like the wolf it\n[46:24] starts to feel like your home court and\n[46:26] so That familiarity I think also makes\n[46:28] it much easier to stick to the habits,\n[46:30] you know, once you start to feel\n[46:31] comfortable there and that takes a\n[46:32] little bit of time. And then the last\n[46:34] piece is identity. The more that you\n[46:37] start to follow this habit, the more you\n[46:39] repeat a habit, the more you reinforce\n[46:41] being that type of person, the more you\n[46:43] start to have that element of your\n[46:44] story. I think this is one of the most\n[46:46] important things for building habits and\n[46:48] getting habits to stick, which is how\n[46:50] your habits reinforce your desired\n[46:52] identity. We often start by asking what\n[46:55] do I wish to achieve? But I think what\n[46:56] we really should start with is who do I\n[46:58] wish to become? What are my actions\n[47:00] reinforcing? What are my actions taking\n[47:01] me closer toward? In a sense, every\n[47:04] action you take is like a vote for the\n[47:06] type of person you wish to become. So,\n[47:09] no, doing one push-up does not transform\n[47:11] your body, but it does cast a vote for\n[47:14] I'm the type of person who doesn't miss\n[47:15] workouts. And no, writing one sentence\n[47:18] does not finish a novel, but it does\n[47:19] cast a vote for I'm a writer. And no,\n[47:22] sending one bit of positive feedback\n[47:23] does not make you like the world's best\n[47:25] leader, but it does cast a vote for I'm\n[47:26] the type of leader who cares about their\n[47:28] teammates. And individually, those are\n[47:31] small things, but collectively you build\n[47:33] up this body of evidence for being that\n[47:35] kind of person.\n[47:36] >> It's a little bit different than what\n[47:37] you often hear. Like you often hear\n[47:38] people say something like um fake it\n[47:40] till you make it.\n[47:42] >> And I don't necessarily have anything\n[47:44] wrong with fake it till you make it.\n[47:45] Like it's um asking you to believe\n[47:46] something positive about yourself. But\n[47:49] behavior and beliefs are a two-way\n[47:51] street. And so what you believe\n[47:53] influences the actions you will take.\n[47:55] And the actions you take also influences\n[47:57] what you will believe. And my\n[47:59] encouragement, my suggestion is to start\n[48:02] with the action. To let the behavior\n[48:03] lead the way. To make one sales call or\n[48:06] meditate for one minute or do one\n[48:07] push-up and let that in that moment be\n[48:09] evidence that you were that type of\n[48:11] person. You know, if you go outside\n[48:12] today and you shoot a basketball for\n[48:14] five minutes, you don't instantly think,\n[48:15] \"Oh, I'm a basketball player.\" But if\n[48:18] you do it every day for next three\n[48:19] months or six months or a year, at some\n[48:21] point you cross this invisible threshold\n[48:23] where you have to admit, I guess playing\n[48:25] basketball is like kind of an important\n[48:26] part of who I am. You know, I guess it's\n[48:28] part of my identity. And once you adopt\n[48:30] a habit as part of your story, once it\n[48:32] becomes part of how you see yourself,\n[48:34] it's not just like I need to go for a\n[48:36] run. It's like I am a runner, you know,\n[48:37] I go I do this because this is part of\n[48:39] who I am. Then you'll fight to maintain\n[48:41] the habit, right? Like then then it\n[48:43] becomes easier for it to stick. And so\n[48:45] the connection between habits and\n[48:46] identity I think is ultimately how you\n[48:48] really get habits to stick for the long\n[48:50] run.\n[48:51] >> It reminds me of a study I was reading\n[48:52] recently that said if you speak to\n[48:54] someone in terms of giving them an\n[48:56] identity versus\n[48:59] using a word as an adjective the\n[49:00] behavior occurs. So an example would be\n[49:02] if I you do something for me and I say\n[49:04] do you know what James you are a kind\n[49:06] person\n[49:07] >> in the studies people become more kind.\n[49:09] But if I say that was kind\n[49:11] >> or that action was kind people are less\n[49:13] kind. So if I if I can give you feedback\n[49:16] that embodies your identity, then you're\n[49:18] more like likely for that behavior to\n[49:19] occur. So with my team, and this is\n[49:21] maybe giving a bit of the game away,\n[49:23] >> I will often refer to them as an\n[49:25] identity. I will say you are an\n[49:27] innovator.\n[49:28] >> You are an experimental because from the\n[49:30] studies I've read that increases the\n[49:31] probability that they embody that\n[49:33] identity.\n[49:34] >> There's another study that um did it for\n[49:36] voting. So people were more likely to go\n[49:38] and vote if you said like I am a voter.\n[49:39] You got them to identify as I'm a voter\n[49:42] rather than are you voting today? Um,\n[49:43] and so same same thing. There's an\n[49:45] example in Atomic Habits I talk about.\n[49:47] Imagine two people who are trying to\n[49:48] quit smoking, you know, and so the first\n[49:50] person gets offered a cigarette and they\n[49:52] say, \"Oh, no thanks. I'm trying not to\n[49:53] smoke.\" Um, and the second person gets\n[49:55] offered and they say, \"Oh, no thanks.\n[49:56] I'm not a smoker.\" And so the first\n[49:58] person is trying to resist something\n[50:00] that they still see themselves as, but\n[50:02] the second person no longer sees\n[50:04] themselves as the type of person who\n[50:06] smokes. And um yeah, some of the\n[50:08] evidence and research suggests that once\n[50:10] you adopt those identities, it's it's\n[50:12] easier for you to stick to the behavior.\n[50:13] >> Reminds me of the research from Leon\n[50:15] Festinger, the guy that came up with the\n[50:16] term cognitive dissonance.\n[50:18] >> The way that I understand the concept of\n[50:20] cognitive dissonance is that if I have a\n[50:21] perceived identity of myself and\n[50:23] something external threatens that or\n[50:24] challenges it, we're not good at living\n[50:27] in contradiction. I'm not good at So,\n[50:28] for example, I'm a an accountant right\n[50:31] now and I hear that AI is doing\n[50:34] accountancy work amazingly well. Now,\n[50:35] I've invested 10 years in that\n[50:37] accountancy degree. I see myself as a\n[50:39] great accountant.\n[50:40] My my my sort of initial reaction will\n[50:43] probably be to either dismiss my current\n[50:45] identity as a great accountant that\n[50:47] that's going to have a great career in\n[50:48] the future or to dismiss the AI. And he\n[50:52] talks, well, people that have studied\n[50:53] his work talk about how we're very poor\n[50:56] at being able to hold two contradictory\n[50:58] things to be true at the same time. So,\n[51:00] um we tend to protect our identity.\n[51:02] >> Yes. Um, there's something incredibly\n[51:04] powerful about this that also ties into\n[51:06] habits, which is that a lot of our\n[51:09] identity, not not the whole thing, but\n[51:10] large portions of our identity are tied\n[51:12] to our relationships. You know, I'm a\n[51:14] father, I'm a, you know, husband, I'm a,\n[51:16] you know, and so like it's the\n[51:17] connection that we have with others. Our\n[51:18] social bonds influence the picture that\n[51:21] we have of ourselves.\n[51:23] >> This is something that widely influences\n[51:25] our habits, you know. So, we are all\n[51:27] part of multiple groups. Sometimes that\n[51:29] group is large, like what it means to be\n[51:31] American or what it means to be British.\n[51:32] Sometimes that group is small, like what\n[51:34] it means to be a neighbor on your street\n[51:36] or a member of this family or a member\n[51:38] at the local CrossFit gym. But all of\n[51:40] the groups that you belong to, large and\n[51:42] small, have a set of shared expectations\n[51:45] for how you act. Have a set of social\n[51:47] norms for what you do in that group. And\n[51:50] when your habits go with the grain of\n[51:52] the expectations of the group, they're\n[51:54] pretty attractive. You know, like you\n[51:55] want to stick to them. You get praised\n[51:56] and rewarded for it. You fit in. And\n[51:58] when they go against the grain of the\n[52:00] expectations of the group, they're kind\n[52:02] of unattractive. You get criticized and\n[52:04] it doesn't feel good. And so if people\n[52:06] have to choose between, I have habits\n[52:09] that um I want, but I'm cast out, I'm\n[52:13] ostracized, I'm criticized, or I have\n[52:16] habits that I don't really love, but I\n[52:18] fit in, I belong, I'm part of something.\n[52:20] Most of the time, the desire to belong\n[52:23] overpowers the desire to improve. And so\n[52:26] you want to do something different, but\n[52:28] you also know you're going to be heavily\n[52:29] criticized for it or you're going to at\n[52:30] least add friction to your\n[52:32] relationships. And we don't want to live\n[52:34] with that dissonance. That dissonance of\n[52:36] I could have this, but I also create\n[52:39] friction here. One of the lessons I\n[52:41] think one of the big takeaways if you\n[52:43] want to build better habits and get\n[52:44] habits to stick particularly for the\n[52:46] long run is you want to join groups\n[52:49] where your desired behavior is the\n[52:51] normal behavior. join groups where you\n[52:53] can rise together, where the people that\n[52:55] you're surrounded by have the type of\n[52:57] habits that you want to have.\n[52:59] >> It reminds me of this um this thing that\n[53:02] appeared in Jeff Bezos's shareholder\n[53:04] letter about resisting the equilibrium.\n[53:06] >> H I I didn't know about this. Go ahead.\n[53:08] >> So, in Jeff Bezos's shareholder letter,\n[53:09] he writes to shareholders that when\n[53:11] referring to Amazon's ability and desire\n[53:14] and need to innovate through the future,\n[53:15] he says he makes a comparison to Richard\n[53:17] Dawkins book called the I think it's a\n[53:20] blind clock maker. Uh yeah the yeah\n[53:22] blind watchman\n[53:23] >> blind watchman. Yeah yeah yeah yeah and\n[53:25] says that essentially all living\n[53:26] organisms live in this constant battle\n[53:28] to resist their equilibrium and actually\n[53:29] death itself is when we become our\n[53:32] environment because right now me and you\n[53:34] have huge amount of energy expenditure\n[53:36] to be different from our environment in\n[53:38] terms of temperature in terms of acidity\n[53:40] etc. And he he's making the comparison\n[53:42] which sounded a lot what like what you\n[53:44] just said that if you want to that all\n[53:47] living organisms are in this constant\n[53:49] battle to be different from our\n[53:51] environment. Um and that the more\n[53:54] different our environment is the harder\n[53:56] the fight. So if I go to the desert my\n[53:58] body has to put put out even more energy\n[54:01] to be a different temperature to be a\n[54:03] different sort of acidity than the\n[54:04] environment. But if I want to make my\n[54:06] life easier and make that fight easier,\n[54:08] then go into an environment where my\n[54:10] environment is the same as my internal\n[54:12] my internal state.\n[54:13] >> That's great. The I think that punchline\n[54:14] of the more different your environment\n[54:16] is from the habits that you want to\n[54:18] build or from whatever equilibrium\n[54:20] you're trying to achieve, the harder you\n[54:21] will have to fight to maintain.\n[54:23] >> And that is a fight that you can do for\n[54:27] I don't know a day, a week, a month, but\n[54:29] it's some limited amount of time. At\n[54:31] some point it just is draining to try to\n[54:34] grind against the environment all the\n[54:35] time. Sometimes I view environment both\n[54:38] physical and social almost like a form\n[54:41] of gravity. You know, like the the\n[54:44] physical environment that we're in right\n[54:45] now, okay, that's always nudging you in\n[54:48] certain directions. Like I'm I'm sitting\n[54:50] in this chair right now talking to you.\n[54:51] I could be sitting anywhere else, but I\n[54:53] would have to sit on the floor, right?\n[54:54] The the environment of the chair is\n[54:56] ushering me to this spot. It's almost\n[54:58] like a form of gravity pulling me here\n[55:00] rather than getting me to go somewhere\n[55:01] else. When we leave this room, if I\n[55:04] wanted, I could try to do something\n[55:05] crazy and break through a wall or climb\n[55:07] through the ceiling or whatever, but I'm\n[55:08] going to go through the door because\n[55:09] that's where the environment is\n[55:11] naturally nudging me toward. It's the\n[55:13] where that behavior happens easily. And\n[55:15] all of our spaces are like that. You're\n[55:17] always being kind of pulled toward what\n[55:19] is natural and easy and consistent in\n[55:21] that environment. So, how can you prime\n[55:23] your environment to make those the\n[55:24] things you want to do? That's for\n[55:25] physical environment. Social environment\n[55:27] is the same. You know, it's all you're\n[55:29] always kind of being pulled toward what\n[55:31] the behaviors are that are natural\n[55:33] there. What are the social norms? What\n[55:34] are the things that people get praised\n[55:36] and rewarded for? What are what is the\n[55:37] culture typically calling you to do? And\n[55:41] that's where I think the answer is you\n[55:43] want to surround yourself with groups\n[55:46] who have the behaviors you want to have.\n[55:48] Join groups where your desired behavior\n[55:50] is normal. If it's normal in that group,\n[55:52] then you can rise together. So, I mean\n[55:54] that that must mean getting rid of\n[55:55] certain people in one's life. And\n[55:57] sometimes those people are hard to get\n[55:58] rid of because their families, their\n[55:59] moms, their dads.\n[56:00] >> Sure. And I, you know, I'm a little uh\n[56:03] sometimes you hear people say things\n[56:04] like, \"Fire your friends,\" you know, or\n[56:06] whatever. Like, and I I I'm not I'm not\n[56:08] all the way there. Uh I I think that\n[56:10] yes, it is true. Sometimes you have um\n[56:13] an extreme circumstance where it's a\n[56:15] particularly toxic person or something\n[56:16] like that. And yeah, like you know, you\n[56:18] probably maybe should not be around them\n[56:19] and that those can lead to very hard\n[56:21] decisions. But I would say for the\n[56:22] majority of life and the majority of\n[56:24] your relationships, what we're really\n[56:26] talking about here is not getting rid of\n[56:28] relationships. We're talking about\n[56:30] finding specific places where that habit\n[56:32] can thrive. So here are some examples.\n[56:35] There's a number of studies that have\n[56:36] shown that it tends to be easier to\n[56:38] build a new habit in a new environment.\n[56:40] So for example, if you Well, first let\n[56:43] me back up. There's an interesting way\n[56:45] to define what a habit is, which is that\n[56:47] it is a behavior that is tied to a\n[56:50] particular context. So, for example,\n[56:52] your habit of watching Netflix might be\n[56:55] tied to the context of your couch at 7\n[56:57] p.m. And whenever you walk into your\n[56:59] living room and you're by your couch and\n[57:01] it's in the evening, you're kind of\n[57:02] naturally being pulled toward picking up\n[57:04] the remote and doing that because that's\n[57:05] the context the habit happens in. So, if\n[57:08] you want to build a new habit, and\n[57:09] again, these studies have found that it\n[57:11] tends to be easier to build a new habit\n[57:13] in a new environment. Well, let's say\n[57:15] you want to start a habit of journaling.\n[57:16] Well, you walk into your living room in\n[57:18] the evening and you sit down on the\n[57:19] couch and you're like, I'm going to\n[57:20] start journaling. But you're naturally,\n[57:22] you know, your brain is kind of like,\n[57:23] well, it's time to pick up the remote\n[57:24] and turn on the TV. That doesn't always\n[57:27] mean that you need a brand new space,\n[57:29] like a new building or a new room to do\n[57:30] every habit in. But you could do\n[57:32] something like you could get a chair and\n[57:34] put it in the corner of the room and\n[57:35] that becomes the journaling chair and\n[57:37] the only thing that you do when you sit\n[57:38] in that chair is you journal for five\n[57:40] minutes. So now you have a new context\n[57:43] that is tied to the behavior that you\n[57:45] want to perform. And in the social\n[57:47] sense, so this is what we were talking\n[57:49] about previously. You want to be able to\n[57:50] create a space that is a safe place for\n[57:52] that envir for that habit to live or for\n[57:54] that habit to thrive. say um sometimes\n[57:58] there those spaces are ready made like\n[58:00] uh let's say you want to do yoga four\n[58:02] days a week but you look around your\n[58:04] family or your friends in your apartment\n[58:05] that you're living nobody else is\n[58:06] interested they don't want to do it too\n[58:08] you do it in the living room you kind of\n[58:09] get made fun of or you're stepping on\n[58:10] other people's space they're like I'm\n[58:12] trying to do stuff in here too you know\n[58:13] it's just kind of inconvenient well you\n[58:15] can go to a yoga studio and that's a\n[58:17] place where for that hour you can be\n[58:18] surrounded by a group where your desired\n[58:20] behavior is normal you don't have to\n[58:22] fire any of your friends um and you can\n[58:24] just go to the place where that happens\n[58:25] that can thrive. And I think each habit\n[58:28] likes to have that. It likes to have\n[58:29] somewhere where it can exist in a way\n[58:31] that it's going to be supported or in a\n[58:32] way where the environment makes it easy.\n[58:35] Sometimes the environment is readyade\n[58:37] like that. Other times it's not. So for\n[58:39] me, one of the most useful things that I\n[58:41] did in my entrepreneurial career, I had\n[58:44] I had no entrepreneurs in my family, no\n[58:45] authors. So I had this thing that I kind\n[58:48] of wanted to do, but I I didn't have\n[58:49] anybody close to me that I could like\n[58:51] look to. first six months that I was an\n[58:53] entrepreneur, I sent like 300 cold\n[58:54] emails just to other people that were\n[58:56] like a year or two ahead of me. Someone\n[58:58] who seemed like you're actually doing\n[58:59] this thing where, you know, you've got\n[59:01] this online audience and you're you're\n[59:02] writing about stuff you like. Um maybe\n[59:06] 30 people got back to me. I did like a\n[59:08] little, you know, Zoom call or whatever\n[59:09] and, you know, we chatted and connected\n[59:11] and then I met some of them at a\n[59:13] conference like six months later. So I\n[59:14] was six months in. I knew like maybe 10\n[59:16] people that I had met in person and I\n[59:18] had like 30 that I had reached out to.\n[59:20] So now it feels like okay at least I\n[59:23] know a couple people who have done this\n[59:24] thing and I started hosting these\n[59:25] retreats every once or twice a year I'd\n[59:28] get six or eight authors together and\n[59:30] I'd say let's just rent an Airbnb. We'll\n[59:32] split the cost and we can talk about how\n[59:33] to build an audience and how to grow\n[59:35] your you know email list and how to\n[59:37] write a book and launch it and you know\n[59:38] all the stuff that we were kind of\n[59:40] focused on. It was almost always like\n[59:42] the best six month uh best weekend of my\n[59:44] year. Um because I would have six months\n[59:46] worth of stuff that I need to execute on\n[59:48] after that was done.\n[59:50] >> That's kind of like going to a yoga\n[59:52] studio for yoga, but you had to create\n[59:54] the space. I was always worried that I\n[59:56] was going to look like some dork, you\n[59:57] know, and like invite everybody and they\n[59:58] would all say no or whatever. But\n[01:00:00] everybody wants the same thing. You\n[01:00:02] know, they're all waiting for somebody\n[01:00:03] to create the space for like-minded\n[01:00:04] people to get together. So sometimes you\n[01:00:06] need enough courage to create the space\n[01:00:08] yourself. But the punch line is the\n[01:00:10] same, which is you're trying to surround\n[01:00:12] yourself with people where your desired\n[01:00:14] behavior is the normal behavior.\n[01:00:17] I've had so many founders speak to me\n[01:00:19] and say, \"Why didn't this particular ad\n[01:00:21] that I ran on this platform work for\n[01:00:23] me?\" Maybe the copy wasn't good. The\n[01:00:25] creative wasn't strong. But usually the\n[01:00:26] problem is they're not having the right\n[01:00:27] conversation because that ad never\n[01:00:29] reached the right person. And if you're\n[01:00:31] in B2B marketing, that is much of the\n[01:00:33] game. And this is where LinkedIn ads\n[01:00:35] solves that problem for you. Their\n[01:00:37] targeting is ridiculously specific. You\n[01:00:39] can target by job title, seniority,\n[01:00:42] company size, industry, and even\n[01:00:44] someone's skill set. And their network\n[01:00:46] includes over a billion professionals.\n[01:00:48] About 130 million of them are decision\n[01:00:51] makers. So when you use LinkedIn ads,\n[01:00:53] you're putting your brand in front of\n[01:00:54] the right people. And LinkedIn ads also\n[01:00:56] drive the highest B2B return on ad spend\n[01:00:59] across all ad networks in my experience.\n[01:01:01] If you want to give them a try, head\n[01:01:03] over to linkedin.com/diary.\n[01:01:06] And when you spend $250 on your first\n[01:01:08] LinkedIn ads campaign, you'll get an\n[01:01:10] extra $250 credit from me for the next\n[01:01:14] one. That's linkedin.com/diary.\n[01:01:17] Terms and conditions apply.\n[01:01:20] I'm thinking about all the people that\n[01:01:21] um are currently sat in a in a job that\n[01:01:23] they don't like. They're sat in the a\n[01:01:25] job in the middle of a big city. They're\n[01:01:27] miserable. They want to go do something\n[01:01:28] else. They want to go be an author. They\n[01:01:30] want to go follow in your footsteps.\n[01:01:32] They want to build a business in a media\n[01:01:35] business for example, but they're so far\n[01:01:37] away from that. They're held in place by\n[01:01:38] their parents' expectations. They're\n[01:01:40] held in place by a mortgage and all the\n[01:01:42] things that you know, life when they get\n[01:01:44] home every day. They're tired. Really,\n[01:01:46] really tired. So, it's remained a dream.\n[01:01:49] You must have so many of those people\n[01:01:50] that write to you that message you um\n[01:01:52] because of what you've you've produced\n[01:01:54] and because of the the content that you\n[01:01:55] make. What do you say to those people?\n[01:02:00] Where where does one one such person\n[01:02:02] start?\n[01:02:02] >> One is I don't think it serves you in\n[01:02:05] any way to just like kind of wallow in\n[01:02:06] how hard it is or to talk about how\n[01:02:08] tough talking complaining about how hard\n[01:02:10] it is just makes it harder,\n[01:02:12] >> you know?\n[01:02:12] >> So the the act of complaining makes a\n[01:02:15] bad situation worse. The act of\n[01:02:17] emphasizing the things that are going\n[01:02:18] well or trying to take it's kind of this\n[01:02:21] endless game of trying to take your\n[01:02:23] current advantages and gain new\n[01:02:25] advantages. So like early on most people\n[01:02:29] don't have many advantages. Like I\n[01:02:30] didn't know anybody in the industry. I\n[01:02:32] didn't have any money. I didn't have any\n[01:02:33] experience. But the one advantage that I\n[01:02:35] did have was I had time. And so I could\n[01:02:38] use that time to try to gain new\n[01:02:40] advantages. So in my case, I used the\n[01:02:42] time to write two articles a week. And I\n[01:02:44] did that for two years. I did like kind\n[01:02:46] of freelance gigs on the side to pay the\n[01:02:48] bills and stuff. And eventually that's\n[01:02:50] how I built the audience. And then once\n[01:02:52] I had the audience two years later, then\n[01:02:54] I I had a new advantage, right? I not\n[01:02:55] only had time, I also had an email list.\n[01:02:58] Now I can go from there and I could get\n[01:02:59] a book deal and then I have a new\n[01:03:00] advantage. I have a book deal and then\n[01:03:01] you know you just kind of like\n[01:03:03] continually use your current advantages\n[01:03:04] to gain new advantages.\n[01:03:06] >> And um I just talked about this for\n[01:03:08] about 20 seconds. That was about seven\n[01:03:10] years of my life that the span of all\n[01:03:12] that, right? It goes it goes slower than\n[01:03:14] what you want. But um it's kind of just\n[01:03:16] that that endless game.\n[01:03:18] >> It goes slower than you would want.\n[01:03:20] Makes me think about this whole uh idea\n[01:03:22] of being 1% better every day.\n[01:03:24] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:03:25] >> What are the most sort of pertinent\n[01:03:26] parts of of understanding that graph?\n[01:03:29] >> Two things stand out. All right. So,\n[01:03:30] first is this is this charts showing\n[01:03:33] what this is showing is if you get 1%\n[01:03:35] better each day for a year. Okay? So,\n[01:03:37] 1.01 to the 365th power, you get 37\n[01:03:41] times better by the end of the year.\n[01:03:42] Right? So, that's this curve. If you get\n[01:03:44] 1% worse, 0.99 to the 3665th power, you\n[01:03:49] drive yourself almost all the way down\n[01:03:50] zero. Now a chart like this is just\n[01:03:53] compound interest, right? This is just a\n[01:03:55] compounding curve. And real life is not\n[01:03:57] exactly like compound interest. You\n[01:03:59] know, your habits are not exactly like\n[01:04:00] this mathematical formula. But I think\n[01:04:02] this chart does a good job of\n[01:04:04] encapsulating what the process of\n[01:04:06] behavior change feels like. You know\n[01:04:08] what it's like to try to get a little\n[01:04:09] bit better each day because two things\n[01:04:11] are true. These are the two things that\n[01:04:12] stand out. First, any compounding curve,\n[01:04:16] the hallmark of any compounding process\n[01:04:17] is all the greatest returns are delayed.\n[01:04:20] Right? you are 80% of the way through\n[01:04:22] this curve before it really starts to\n[01:04:23] take off. So all the greatest returns\n[01:04:25] are delayed. The early stuff doesn't\n[01:04:26] feel that impressive. The second is the\n[01:04:29] on day one the separation between 0.99\n[01:04:32] and 1.01 is very small, right? 1% better\n[01:04:36] or 1% worse is very minor.\n[01:04:39] >> So on any given day, it's very easy to\n[01:04:42] dismiss, you know, what is the\n[01:04:43] difference between eating something\n[01:04:44] healthy for lunch or eating something\n[01:04:46] unhealthy. Today, basically nothing.\n[01:04:48] Your body looks the same in the mirror\n[01:04:49] at the end of the night. The scale\n[01:04:50] hasn't changed. You know, there's no\n[01:04:51] evidence. What is the difference between\n[01:04:54] the person who reads for 10 minutes\n[01:04:55] today and the person who doesn't\n[01:04:57] basically nothing to reading for 10\n[01:04:59] minutes does not make you a genius. But\n[01:05:02] the person who always goes to bed a\n[01:05:04] little bit smarter than they were when\n[01:05:05] they woke up. The person who always\n[01:05:07] takes a little bit of time each day to\n[01:05:08] learn something new. Yeah. Two or five\n[01:05:10] or 10 years later, like that's a\n[01:05:11] meaningful difference in wisdom and\n[01:05:13] insight. And so you see this same\n[01:05:15] pattern again and again throughout life,\n[01:05:17] which is what starts out small and it's\n[01:05:19] pretty insignificant, easy to dismiss on\n[01:05:21] a daily basis, it compounds, it\n[01:05:24] multiplies, it improves over time. And\n[01:05:26] so the effects of your habits are\n[01:05:28] delayed. Time will magnify whatever you\n[01:05:31] feed it. So if you have good habits,\n[01:05:33] time becomes your ally. And every day\n[01:05:35] that goes by, you put yourself in a\n[01:05:36] stronger position. If you have bad\n[01:05:38] habits, time becomes your enemy. And\n[01:05:40] every day that goes by, you dig the hole\n[01:05:41] a little bit deeper. And so the real\n[01:05:43] lesson of a chart like this, the real\n[01:05:45] lesson of getting 1% better every day is\n[01:05:48] not to get wrapped up in the number.\n[01:05:50] It's not like, oh, is it a 1%\n[01:05:52] improvement or 1.6% or whatever. It's\n[01:05:54] not about that. It's an attitude. It's\n[01:05:56] an approach. It's a focus, an emphasis\n[01:05:59] on trajectory rather than position.\n[01:06:03] >> You know, there's a lot of discussion\n[01:06:04] about position in life. How much money's\n[01:06:06] in my bank account? What's the number on\n[01:06:08] the scale? What's the stock price? What\n[01:06:09] are the quarterly earnings? We have all\n[01:06:11] these measurements and metrics for\n[01:06:13] assessing our current position. And then\n[01:06:15] if the position isn't what we want it to\n[01:06:17] be, we get frustrated or we feel guilty\n[01:06:20] or we judge ourselves or we get annoyed\n[01:06:22] or whatever. And what I'm encouraging is\n[01:06:24] to say, listen, just for a minute, let's\n[01:06:26] stop worrying so much about our current\n[01:06:28] position and instead focus a little bit\n[01:06:31] more on our current trajectory. Am I\n[01:06:33] getting 1% better or 1% worse? Is the\n[01:06:36] arrow pointed up and to the right or\n[01:06:37] have we flatlined? So if you're on a\n[01:06:39] good trajectory, all you need is time.\n[01:06:42] >> This is this has almost become a\n[01:06:44] religious belief. I because I think for\n[01:06:46] everything you've said, it has to become\n[01:06:47] a religious belief because the results\n[01:06:49] are hard to see in the near term. But um\n[01:06:51] it is most certainly a religious belief\n[01:06:53] in our team.\n[01:06:54] >> I have multiple readers who got tattoos\n[01:06:55] of it, which I was not expecting. I drew\n[01:06:57] this on an index card and now it's on\n[01:06:59] somebody's body.\n[01:07:01] >> Yeah, that was that was definitely\n[01:07:03] surprising. And it needs that religion\n[01:07:05] because that first part where you you're\n[01:07:08] doing something and there's no progress,\n[01:07:10] there's no evidence of progress.\n[01:07:11] >> There is something tricky about this\n[01:07:12] that I think is important. So we all we\n[01:07:15] all have made this mistake before which\n[01:07:17] is you can make 1% improvements that\n[01:07:19] accumulate and you can make 1%\n[01:07:21] improvements that evaporate. Right? You\n[01:07:23] can spend your time time on trivial\n[01:07:24] stuff meaningful. You know see it can be\n[01:07:26] meaningful small changes or it can be\n[01:07:28] meaningless small changes. And so how do\n[01:07:30] you decide the difference between the\n[01:07:32] two? That's kind of tricky and I I don't\n[01:07:34] know that you can always get it\n[01:07:35] perfectly right, but to me the dividing\n[01:07:38] line is does this action accumulate into\n[01:07:40] something larger or not? You know, you\n[01:07:42] can you can spend your time doing all\n[01:07:44] small stuff, whatever day in and day\n[01:07:45] out, but are you building towards\n[01:07:46] something bigger?\n[01:07:47] >> And so, in a lot of ways, I think the\n[01:07:50] two time frames that matter most in life\n[01:07:52] are 10 years and one hour.\n[01:07:55] >> You know, 10 years is just shorthand for\n[01:07:57] like what's the big meaningful stuff\n[01:07:58] you're working toward. You think about\n[01:08:00] most of the stuff that people really\n[01:08:01] care, the meaningful movements in life,\n[01:08:04] most of them are multi-year things, you\n[01:08:06] know, build a business that you're proud\n[01:08:07] of, raising a successful family, you\n[01:08:10] know, having a a happy marriage, getting\n[01:08:12] in the best shape of your life, what\n[01:08:13] whatever it is, contributing to some\n[01:08:15] cause that you care about, like they're\n[01:08:16] usually big multi-year, sometimes\n[01:08:18] multi-deade things. So 10 years is\n[01:08:21] shorthand for that. But if you can do\n[01:08:23] one thing each day that's going to serve\n[01:08:26] you well in 10 years, if you can find\n[01:08:28] one hour sometime today to do something\n[01:08:30] that's going to pay off in a decade, you\n[01:08:32] usually don't even need to wait 10 years\n[01:08:34] for it to really start to show up. You\n[01:08:35] know, usually you get two or three or\n[01:08:36] four years into that and you're like,\n[01:08:37] \"Wow, I can't believe how this stuff's\n[01:08:39] accumulating already.\" And it makes me\n[01:08:41] think again about your idea of systems\n[01:08:42] versus goals because the most\n[01:08:44] exceptional founders I know they'll\n[01:08:46] think about what can I do in the next\n[01:08:47] hour so that in 10 years time we're in a\n[01:08:49] different place which again it sounds\n[01:08:52] I've said this a few times but one of\n[01:08:53] the most important things in business I\n[01:08:55] mean the definition of the word company\n[01:08:56] is hiring. So most I think all nearly\n[01:08:58] all problems I face in business are a\n[01:09:00] people problem.\n[01:09:02] >> It's like a people mistake that I have\n[01:09:03] or haven't you know made yet. So the\n[01:09:06] further I've got in my career, I've\n[01:09:07] started to think that actually most of\n[01:09:09] my the next hour of my life should be\n[01:09:12] working on people because that corrects\n[01:09:14] what happens in 10 years time. Like if\n[01:09:16] we want to go want my company to go\n[01:09:18] public in 10 years time, in the next\n[01:09:19] hour I should really be thinking about a\n[01:09:21] hiring process which will find the CFO\n[01:09:23] which will build the business.\n[01:09:24] >> And here you are talking to me,\n[01:09:25] >> right? No, but I'm learning. But and I'm\n[01:09:28] going to go take it out and I'm going to\n[01:09:29] go. No, but it's really it's really\n[01:09:30] useful speaking to you about this\n[01:09:31] because it's given me the wording to\n[01:09:36] which will create memorability which\n[01:09:37] will create the repetitions and the\n[01:09:38] habits if you know what I'm saying. Is\n[01:09:39] it on straight? And I I wasn't thinking\n[01:09:42] in terms of systems and goals. I was I I\n[01:09:44] always refer to it with people. I say\n[01:09:46] what's furthest upstream.\n[01:09:47] >> Yeah.\n[01:09:48] >> And this can also be what we're saying\n[01:09:49] about sleep. And I I see hiring for\n[01:09:51] example in business or actually\n[01:09:52] generally in your personal life\n[01:09:54] selecting people as the single most\n[01:09:56] important factor to everything that\n[01:09:58] happens downstream.\n[01:09:59] >> Relationships in general are probably\n[01:10:01] there it's obvious to everybody that\n[01:10:03] they matter and yet they still are\n[01:10:04] probably perpetually undervalued. Yeah.\n[01:10:06] >> So uh it's true in a business sense\n[01:10:09] which is what you're talking about here.\n[01:10:10] Like almost every business problem at\n[01:10:11] some level could be a people problem or\n[01:10:13] there's a person who could unlock it and\n[01:10:15] solve that problem. It's true in a\n[01:10:16] personal sense. the most important\n[01:10:18] decision you probably will make is like\n[01:10:20] whether or who you get married to. Uh\n[01:10:22] that you know that will dramatically\n[01:10:23] shape your life.\n[01:10:24] >> It's also true in like a just a luck\n[01:10:27] business life sense which is that\n[01:10:31] there is no such thing as an opportunity\n[01:10:33] that is not tied to a person, right?\n[01:10:34] Like opportunities come through people.\n[01:10:36] And so when you say, \"Oh, I wish I could\n[01:10:38] just like have some good luck or I wish\n[01:10:40] I could like catch my lucky break.\" what\n[01:10:42] you're probably talking about is there's\n[01:10:43] a person who carries that opportunity\n[01:10:45] with them that you need to interface\n[01:10:47] with or get to know and so in all of\n[01:10:49] these ways relationships dramatically\n[01:10:51] shape our lives and uh yeah people\n[01:10:54] people are probably the most important\n[01:10:55] thing in that sense\n[01:10:56] >> I think with with with age that becomes\n[01:10:59] more apparent for most people it becomes\n[01:11:01] more most apparent that the best\n[01:11:03] decisions I've made in my life were\n[01:11:04] people and the worst decisions I made in\n[01:11:06] my life were also people\n[01:11:08] >> but we don't think about that we think\n[01:11:09] I'll work Saturday and Sunday in the I\n[01:11:11] I'll have some great idea. If I read a\n[01:11:13] book, I'll have some great idea which\n[01:11:14] will make me lucky and successful.\n[01:11:16] Whereas um with time, I realize that the\n[01:11:19] smart work versus the hard work is\n[01:11:21] focusing much more on on people. How how\n[01:11:23] do you how does your work dovetail into\n[01:11:25] things like um self-esteem and\n[01:11:27] confidence and because everybody wants\n[01:11:29] to build confidence and for some people\n[01:11:32] they're in a bit of a downward\n[01:11:33] reinforcing confidence spiral which I\n[01:11:35] guess would look something like this.\n[01:11:36] you know, something happened in their\n[01:11:38] life, so they're less likely to raise\n[01:11:40] their hand or to step outside of their\n[01:11:42] zone zone of comfort. And even when and\n[01:11:44] if they do, they interpret it\n[01:11:45] negatively, and that knocks their\n[01:11:47] confidence. They see it, they're wearing\n[01:11:49] sunglasses that interpret the things\n[01:11:51] that are happening as negative, and\n[01:11:52] they're in this sort of downward\n[01:11:54] compounding spiral.\n[01:11:55] >> Mhm.\n[01:11:55] >> And there's other people that seem to be\n[01:11:57] going the other way. First is um I had a\n[01:12:01] high school basketball coach that told\n[01:12:02] me, \"Confidence is just displayed\n[01:12:04] ability.\" And what he meant was if you\n[01:12:07] want to feel more confident about like\n[01:12:09] your ability to make a free throw, go\n[01:12:10] out there and shoot for an hour and once\n[01:12:12] you knock down 10 in a row, you're going\n[01:12:13] to feel a lot better about it. And so\n[01:12:15] what you realize, this is true for\n[01:12:16] everything, which is once you have\n[01:12:18] started to display your ability in any\n[01:12:21] given area, you know, give a successful\n[01:12:23] speech or, you know, make a nice\n[01:12:24] presentation for work or whatever it is,\n[01:12:27] you feel better about it. And so what\n[01:12:29] you realize is you need reps. You know,\n[01:12:31] you need practice. Whatever the thing\n[01:12:33] is, you need you need enough repetition\n[01:12:35] to start to learn how to do the thing.\n[01:12:37] And so this is why sometimes I'll say\n[01:12:39] like motivation comes after starting,\n[01:12:41] not before. We think we need motivation\n[01:12:43] to get started, but in fact, you should\n[01:12:44] try to scale it down and make it so easy\n[01:12:46] that you'll do it even if you don't feel\n[01:12:48] that motivated about it and start get\n[01:12:50] some reps in and then once you've get\n[01:12:52] got and then once you have performed the\n[01:12:54] repetitions, you start to build up some\n[01:12:56] confidence because you know that you\n[01:12:57] have some evidence that you can do it.\n[01:12:58] So confidence is displayed ability.\n[01:13:00] Let's try to scale it down, make it\n[01:13:02] easy, start to display our ability, and\n[01:13:04] then the confidence comes as a side\n[01:13:05] effect. The second thing though, and\n[01:13:07] this this might even be the more\n[01:13:09] important piece. You mentioned this idea\n[01:13:10] of someone who interprets things in a\n[01:13:12] negative frame. You know, they they get\n[01:13:14] in the caught in this like downward\n[01:13:16] spiral. They see like evidence of things\n[01:13:17] working against them or the world is\n[01:13:19] tilted against them or like they're\n[01:13:20] emphasizing the pieces of the story that\n[01:13:22] aren't serving them that well. I had so\n[01:13:24] I played baseball for a long time. I\n[01:13:25] played through college. Um, and when I\n[01:13:27] was younger, uh, I was 10, 12, 14, after\n[01:13:30] each season, we would do this thing. My\n[01:13:32] dad and I would go out and sit on the\n[01:13:33] back deck and we would talk about like\n[01:13:36] the wins, the good parts of the of the,\n[01:13:38] you know, the biggest games that our\n[01:13:39] team won or like my best plays from the\n[01:13:41] year or just like things that I got\n[01:13:43] better at from the season before. And I\n[01:13:46] was never the best player on any team\n[01:13:47] that I was on. But you finish each\n[01:13:50] season with a sense of positivity, a\n[01:13:52] sense of confidence, this feeling of\n[01:13:54] like momentum going into the next year.\n[01:13:56] And I think I played for a long time\n[01:13:58] partially because of that, you know,\n[01:14:00] like we were it was a practice of\n[01:14:02] emphasizing your wins. And so I think\n[01:14:06] that's an interesting thing that like\n[01:14:07] more people should try is when you look\n[01:14:10] back on your last year, what are some of\n[01:14:11] the wins that you've had? And try to use\n[01:14:13] that, you know, tell yourself that\n[01:14:14] story, emphasize that story and use that\n[01:14:16] to move into the next moment. I was\n[01:14:18] talking recently. So, I have this I have\n[01:14:21] this publishing company that I\n[01:14:22] co-founded, Author's Equity, and we're\n[01:14:25] publishing this book from this guy named\n[01:14:26] Brandon Webb, who is a former Navy Seal.\n[01:14:29] He uh trained the Navy Seal sniper unit\n[01:14:31] in mental performance. And so, he he\n[01:14:35] would teach them all kinds of things. I\n[01:14:36] was talking to him about the book and\n[01:14:37] some of the strategies and I was trying\n[01:14:38] to learn like what they would do. And\n[01:14:40] two things stood out to me. The first\n[01:14:41] thing he said is a positive outlook no\n[01:14:43] matter the scenario. So the first thing\n[01:14:45] we train them on is positive outlook no\n[01:14:46] matter what situation or scenario\n[01:14:48] they're in. The second thing is\n[01:14:50] visualizing things going well. Okay. So\n[01:14:54] so one time a sniper came up to him and\n[01:14:56] said what's a good score on this uh\n[01:14:58] course like they would give them these\n[01:14:59] little courses to test like you know\n[01:15:00] they have to make eight or 10 or 12\n[01:15:02] different shots or whatever. And he said\n[01:15:04] a good score is 100%. And he was like\n[01:15:07] now in reality almost nobody gets 100%.\n[01:15:09] Um, but I wanted to set that standard,\n[01:15:12] right? To set that outcome in their mind\n[01:15:14] as the thing that they were shooting\n[01:15:15] for. And he had two guys he was\n[01:15:16] training. One of them got a 96, one of\n[01:15:18] them got 100. Um, anyway, the point is\n[01:15:20] that\n[01:15:22] in life, there are always things that go\n[01:15:24] well and things that go poorly. There\n[01:15:26] will always be days that things are\n[01:15:28] stacked against you and days when things\n[01:15:29] seem to go your way. And the question\n[01:15:31] is, which story are you telling\n[01:15:33] yourself? You know, which version of the\n[01:15:35] events are you emphasizing? Now, I'm not\n[01:15:37] suggesting that you should like ignore\n[01:15:38] reality. You know, if there's a problem\n[01:15:40] that needs to be addressed, then you\n[01:15:41] still need to address it. But as long as\n[01:15:43] you're not re ignoring reality, I feel\n[01:15:46] like the only thing that makes sense is\n[01:15:48] to emphasize the empowering version. You\n[01:15:50] know, to emphasize the wins, to sit down\n[01:15:52] and reflect on what you've done and\n[01:15:53] think about what the wins were and how\n[01:15:54] that feeds into your momentum going\n[01:15:56] forward and to visualize the next step\n[01:15:58] and how it's going to go well. It\n[01:16:00] reminds me of um something Sir David\n[01:16:02] Brford said to me who I know is the\n[01:16:04] prominent in the first chapter of your\n[01:16:05] book.\n[01:16:06] >> Um he was talking a lot about 1% gains\n[01:16:08] etc. And he says the thing that he\n[01:16:10] doesn't get to talk about enough is the\n[01:16:12] psychological momentum that's created\n[01:16:14] from\n[01:16:16] accomplishing these 1% gains and\n[01:16:18] celebrating them amongst the team. He\n[01:16:19] said to me that when he was in the\n[01:16:20] British cycling team and he went into\n[01:16:22] there and they were down and out and\n[01:16:23] depressed and kind of being ridiculed\n[01:16:24] for being this terrible team. He goes,\n[01:16:26] \"We started, you know, stacking up the\n[01:16:27] 1%s, etc.\" And the crazy thing that\n[01:16:30] happened is we started to quote feel\n[01:16:32] like we were going somewhere and people\n[01:16:34] stopped leaving the bike shop at 5:00\n[01:16:36] p.m. and started staying till 2:00 a.m.\n[01:16:39] because they felt like they were going\n[01:16:40] somewhere. It dovetails into your point\n[01:16:42] about progress, but also just the power\n[01:16:44] of being intentional about um\n[01:16:47] celebrating those wins and the\n[01:16:49] psychological momentum it creates in a\n[01:16:50] group of people and yourself.\n[01:16:51] >> That's great. I think you do need to be\n[01:16:53] a little bit more intentional about it\n[01:16:55] in the real world. So if you look if you\n[01:16:56] look at some of the most habit forming\n[01:16:58] technologies or some of the most habit\n[01:17:00] forming things like let's take video\n[01:17:01] games for example in a video game there\n[01:17:04] are continual constant forms of\n[01:17:07] progress. So your score is increasing in\n[01:17:09] like the top corner of the screen\n[01:17:11] whenever you pick up a weapon or a ruby\n[01:17:13] or a gem or whatever it's like a little\n[01:17:14] jingle or chime or some musical note.\n[01:17:16] Even the pitterpatter of footsteps as\n[01:17:18] you like run through the level is a\n[01:17:20] signal that you're making progress that\n[01:17:21] you're moving forward that you're going\n[01:17:23] somewhere. And so if you compare all of\n[01:17:25] that immediate feedback that you're\n[01:17:27] getting like all in the same moment when\n[01:17:28] you're playing this level\n[01:17:30] >> and then you walk outside and you think\n[01:17:32] about most of the things you're working\n[01:17:33] on in real life, you're like this\n[01:17:35] committee's been meeting every Friday\n[01:17:36] for six months. We still haven't shipped\n[01:17:38] this feature, you know, like I've been\n[01:17:39] running every day for the last month and\n[01:17:41] I still don't see a change in my body.\n[01:17:42] And so it's very hard to compare the\n[01:17:46] digital world and all the progress that\n[01:17:47] we get there through our screens to the\n[01:17:49] physical world and the habits that we're\n[01:17:51] trying to build and foster in our lives\n[01:17:52] and businesses.\n[01:17:54] >> And I think that's one reason why it is\n[01:17:56] nice to be more intentional about it to\n[01:17:58] try to think about what are the 1%\n[01:18:00] improvements or the small gains that we\n[01:18:02] can make today and then celebrating\n[01:18:03] those wins so that you have some feeling\n[01:18:05] of progress there because in the real\n[01:18:07] world progress is often delayed. You\n[01:18:10] know, my parents like to swim. Well, if\n[01:18:13] they were swimming for the change that\n[01:18:14] they're going to see in their body, it\n[01:18:16] takes two years, you know, like they the\n[01:18:18] problem is they jump into the water and\n[01:18:19] their body looks exactly the same when\n[01:18:21] they get out, right? And so, you need\n[01:18:23] something in the moment that gives you\n[01:18:24] some signal of progress. They use a\n[01:18:26] habit tracker. So, they have like a\n[01:18:28] little template where they just put a\n[01:18:29] little X on that day. But, you need\n[01:18:31] something that visualizes your progress,\n[01:18:34] that gives you some signal that you're\n[01:18:35] moving forward. I was reminded then of\n[01:18:37] the Harvard Business Review did the\n[01:18:38] study where they asked people what their\n[01:18:39] best day in work was and they asked them\n[01:18:40] to keep work diaries. I think it was\n[01:18:41] about a thousand people and the majority\n[01:18:43] of people pointed at a day in their work\n[01:18:45] diary in that week where they had a\n[01:18:46] feeling of progress even if it was tiny\n[01:18:48] >> as and this goes to your point about\n[01:18:50] making it fun as well. So highlighting\n[01:18:52] one's progress and celebrating it makes\n[01:18:54] it fun but also that psychological\n[01:18:55] momentum. And then also you can do this\n[01:18:57] stuff you can do the 1% better every\n[01:18:59] day. you put yourself in a position to\n[01:19:02] experience the feeling of progress if\n[01:19:04] you scale your habits down. So let's say\n[01:19:06] sometimes there in chemistry there's\n[01:19:08] this com um there's this concept of\n[01:19:09] activation energy how much energy it\n[01:19:11] takes to activate a reaction.\n[01:19:13] >> So you know if the activation energy is\n[01:19:15] high you have to put a lot of heat or a\n[01:19:17] lot of energy into the reaction to make\n[01:19:19] it occur.\n[01:19:20] >> I think habits kind of have an\n[01:19:21] activation energy too. So like let's say\n[01:19:24] that your habit is to do a 100 push-ups\n[01:19:26] a day. the activation energy for that's\n[01:19:28] kind of high on the first day when\n[01:19:30] you're really pumped about it. Maybe\n[01:19:31] you're doing sets of 10 all throughout\n[01:19:32] the day and you get to 100 and you feel\n[01:19:34] really good. Maybe you can do that for a\n[01:19:35] couple days or a week or whatever, you\n[01:19:37] know. Um but at some point you get to a\n[01:19:40] day where you're tired or you had a lot\n[01:19:42] to do at work or whatever and then you\n[01:19:43] turn around it's 9:30 and you're like, I\n[01:19:44] need to go to bed soon. Do I feel like\n[01:19:46] doing 100 push-ups? Um and then you skip\n[01:19:48] it. But if you're something much\n[01:19:50] smaller, like your goal is to do one\n[01:19:52] push-up or 10 push-ups, well, that is a\n[01:19:54] lot easier and the activation energy is\n[01:19:56] much lower. And so then you get to that\n[01:19:58] day eight or nine or 10 days in when\n[01:20:00] it's 9:30, you can still do 10 push-ups\n[01:20:02] before you go to bed, right? And so you\n[01:20:05] still get the feeling of progress. You\n[01:20:07] still get the feeling that you're moving\n[01:20:08] forward simply because you set the bar\n[01:20:10] lower to start. You know, if the bar is\n[01:20:12] perfect at the beginning, it's really\n[01:20:15] hard to maintain that for very long. But\n[01:20:17] if the bar is getting you in now, you\n[01:20:19] build momentum and you get the feeling\n[01:20:21] of progress and you get a month or two\n[01:20:22] months or three months in and you still\n[01:20:24] have a streak going and you feel pretty\n[01:20:26] good about yourself. And at some point\n[01:20:28] you start doing it enough that you\n[01:20:30] realize, okay, there will probably be a\n[01:20:32] day in here where I miss, but I still\n[01:20:34] feel good about who I am and how much\n[01:20:36] I've shown up here and like you've\n[01:20:37] proven a lot to yourself. And so I I\n[01:20:39] think sometimes scaling it down and\n[01:20:41] making it easy gives yourself a better\n[01:20:43] opportunity to feel progress. two words\n[01:20:46] you said in in the last couple of\n[01:20:47] minutes. One of them was your parents\n[01:20:48] use a habit tracker and the other one\n[01:20:49] was use the word streak.\n[01:20:51] >> Yeah.\n[01:20:52] >> Do you understand the context of this\n[01:20:53] jar that was in front of me with with\n[01:20:54] paper clips? Could you explain to me\n[01:20:56] habit tracking and streaks and why why\n[01:20:58] they matter?\n[01:20:59] >> So when I was working on atomic habits,\n[01:21:01] I came across this guy named Trent\n[01:21:02] Durstman and he was uh he had an\n[01:21:05] interesting story. He's an entrepreneur\n[01:21:07] now, but early in his career um he had\n[01:21:10] this job where he was a stock broker in\n[01:21:12] Abbottzford, Canada. and Abbottzford,\n[01:21:14] this is like in the '90s time was like\n[01:21:15] pretty small town, like it it wasn't,\n[01:21:17] you know, some big uh city. And he was\n[01:21:21] supposed to just drive more business,\n[01:21:23] but like, you know, they didn't have a\n[01:21:24] lot of advantages. It wasn't like he was\n[01:21:25] in New York or whatever. He had this one\n[01:21:27] simple habit that he used to end up\n[01:21:30] becoming the top performer in the firm\n[01:21:32] and building the biggest book of\n[01:21:34] business there over like the next couple\n[01:21:35] years. And it was this simple strategy\n[01:21:37] of paper clips. So all he did, a lot of\n[01:21:40] his stockbroker friends who were like\n[01:21:42] also working in this job, they would\n[01:21:44] read analyst reports, they would look at\n[01:21:46] the news, they would try to analyze\n[01:21:48] company's financial statements. They\n[01:21:49] were doing all this other stuff. And he\n[01:21:50] said, \"I'm not going to do that. All I'm\n[01:21:52] going to do\n[01:21:53] >> is I'm going to make a sales call and\n[01:21:55] whenever I make a call, see how tight\n[01:21:57] anybody put these on. Um, whenever\n[01:21:59] whenever I make a call, I'm going to\n[01:22:01] make a sales call and then I'm going to\n[01:22:02] take one paperclip and I'm going to move\n[01:22:04] it over. And then I'm going to make\n[01:22:06] another sales call. I'm going to take\n[01:22:08] another paper clip and move it over. And\n[01:22:10] he had a hundred paper clips in the jar.\n[01:22:12] And his goal every day was to move a\n[01:22:14] hundred from one jar to the next. And\n[01:22:16] that was all he did. And with that one\n[01:22:18] simple habit, he ended up building this\n[01:22:20] huge book of business. Two things about\n[01:22:22] this. One, obviously, he has a visual\n[01:22:25] marker of the progress that he's making,\n[01:22:27] right? So moving paper clips to the\n[01:22:29] other jar is a way to see that he's\n[01:22:31] progressing throughout the day. It also\n[01:22:32] makes it a little bit into like a little\n[01:22:34] game, you know? It's like, okay, how how\n[01:22:36] quickly can I move the paper clips over?\n[01:22:37] How much, you know, progress am I\n[01:22:39] making? Do I have 50 over by the time\n[01:22:40] lunch rolls around? You know, you can\n[01:22:42] start to see how you you have a little\n[01:22:44] bit of a uh this these progressive\n[01:22:46] markers throughout the day.\n[01:22:47] >> But the other thing that I think is\n[01:22:49] interesting about it is he boiled it\n[01:22:50] down to just what was the one thing that\n[01:22:52] really moved the needle, you know, and\n[01:22:54] he just focused on that. And there are\n[01:22:56] so many things in life that it's really\n[01:22:58] easy to get focused on the optimization.\n[01:23:00] It's so if you are so focused on finding\n[01:23:03] the perfect sales strategy, the best\n[01:23:05] business plan, the ideal diet to follow,\n[01:23:08] you're so focused on optimizing, you're\n[01:23:09] like, \"Okay, how about sometimes people\n[01:23:11] will come to me and they'll say they\n[01:23:12] want to build an audience and they like\n[01:23:13] ask about all the tactics and the\n[01:23:15] strategies and I say just write an\n[01:23:18] article every week for the next two\n[01:23:19] years and then get back to me like that.\n[01:23:21] Let's not skip that part. Can we start\n[01:23:22] let's start there or like let's not miss\n[01:23:24] a workout for two years and then like we\n[01:23:26] can talk about whether the program is\n[01:23:27] working or not, you know?\" And it's like\n[01:23:29] that. So I think this helps you focus on\n[01:23:32] what is the big thing that's really\n[01:23:33] moving the the needle.\n[01:23:35] >> I was thinking it about it through the\n[01:23:36] frame of the habit cycle as well because\n[01:23:39] as I look at this habit cycle I'm seeing\n[01:23:41] reward being hit. I'm seeing uh a desire\n[01:23:44] for an outcome as well.\n[01:23:46] >> Yeah. Yeah. This is interesting. So\n[01:23:47] there um we haven't talked about this\n[01:23:48] yet so let me just break it down real\n[01:23:50] quick. So if you're building a habit\n[01:23:52] there are roughly four different stages\n[01:23:54] that every habit goes through. So I call\n[01:23:56] them in the book in atomic habits I call\n[01:23:57] them Q, craving, response and reward.\n[01:23:59] Right? So the Q is just something that\n[01:24:01] you notice. So let's say for example you\n[01:24:03] see a plate of cookies on the counter in\n[01:24:04] the kitchen. That's a visual cue. The\n[01:24:07] craving is the prediction that your\n[01:24:09] brain makes about what that Q means. So\n[01:24:11] you see the plate of cookies, your brain\n[01:24:12] predicts, oh that'll be sweet, sugary,\n[01:24:14] tasty, enjoyable. So that favorable\n[01:24:16] prediction motivates you to take the\n[01:24:18] response. That's the third step. You\n[01:24:20] walk over, pick it up, and take a bite.\n[01:24:22] And then finally, the fourth step is the\n[01:24:24] reward. Oh, it is in fact sweet, sugary,\n[01:24:26] tasty, enjoyable. So, Q, craving,\n[01:24:28] response, reward.\n[01:24:31] These steps are basically what every\n[01:24:33] habitual behavior is going through. Even\n[01:24:35] even really automatic stuff like let's\n[01:24:37] say you walk into a room and the lights\n[01:24:39] are off. So, Q, it's dark. Craving, I\n[01:24:42] want to be able to see. Response, I flip\n[01:24:44] on the light switch. Reward, the lights\n[01:24:46] come on. Now, it's it's visible out\n[01:24:48] there. So even really fast stuff like\n[01:24:51] turning on a light switch is going\n[01:24:52] through those four steps. So pretty much\n[01:24:54] every habit follows that cycle. And you\n[01:24:56] can see that you know this uh paperclip\n[01:24:58] strategy does kind of play into this a\n[01:25:00] little bit. Q you have the paper clips\n[01:25:02] on the desk, right? So like not only do\n[01:25:04] you want to make the sales calls for a\n[01:25:05] business standpoint, but you also have\n[01:25:07] these staring at you every morning when\n[01:25:08] you come into your desk. And so it's a\n[01:25:09] little bit of a visual reminder, reminds\n[01:25:11] you, prompts you to think, okay, all\n[01:25:13] right, I do want to make these calls and\n[01:25:14] try to drive more business or, you know,\n[01:25:16] build build up the um make another\n[01:25:18] successful sales call. That craving gets\n[01:25:19] you to pick up the phone, the actual\n[01:25:21] response. And then the reward is I get\n[01:25:23] to move the paperclip over and now I\n[01:25:25] feel like yeah, you get the little\n[01:25:27] >> ting jingle in your ear of the paperclip\n[01:25:29] hitting and you know, it just get it\n[01:25:32] adds to the reward effect. What I think\n[01:25:34] is most interesting is how do we take\n[01:25:36] this how do we take these four steps\n[01:25:38] that basically all behaviors go through\n[01:25:40] and then translate it into something\n[01:25:42] that we can use and apply in daily life\n[01:25:45] and work. So I call this the four laws\n[01:25:47] of behavior change. So there's one for\n[01:25:49] there's one for each step. Yeah, you got\n[01:25:51] them right here.\n[01:25:52] >> I'll give them to you.\n[01:25:54] >> So I call these the four laws of\n[01:25:55] behavior change, right? So for the Q,\n[01:25:58] the first law is you want to make it\n[01:25:59] obvious. All right? You want the cues.\n[01:26:01] You want the cues of your good habits to\n[01:26:03] be obvious, available, visible, easy to\n[01:26:06] see. Easier it is to see or get your\n[01:26:08] attention, the more likely you are to\n[01:26:09] act on it. So, a lot of that's about\n[01:26:11] environment. It's about making things\n[01:26:12] obvious, but it's the Q gets your\n[01:26:14] attention, something you notice.\n[01:26:16] >> So, let's put this in the context of me\n[01:26:18] wanting to make sure I have my\n[01:26:19] supplement routine every day.\n[01:26:20] >> Sure.\n[01:26:21] >> Because that's something I think about.\n[01:26:22] Yeah.\n[01:26:22] >> I want to have my creatine every day.\n[01:26:23] >> So, it's like, where's the creatine in\n[01:26:25] the kitchen? you know, is it is it\n[01:26:26] tucked up in a high shelf and it's\n[01:26:28] behind like a cabinet door and you don't\n[01:26:29] really see it or is it like out on the\n[01:26:31] counter? It's one of the first things\n[01:26:32] that you see. So there, you know, there\n[01:26:33] are varying degrees of what you want to\n[01:26:35] do here and like what you want to place\n[01:26:36] out, but you're just trying to make the\n[01:26:38] good habit obvious. You want to make it\n[01:26:39] easy to notice. Reminds me of when I\n[01:26:41] started DJing and the DJing equipment\n[01:26:43] was upstairs in the spare room out the\n[01:26:45] way and I had a conversation with my\n[01:26:46] girlfriend who's through there and I was\n[01:26:47] like, I really want to learn DJing. So,\n[01:26:49] can I put it on the kitchen counter for\n[01:26:50] the next year?\n[01:26:52] >> Because then I'll be walking past one\n[01:26:53] day and go, \"Oh, DJ.\" you know, and then\n[01:26:54] I put it on the kitchen counter and I\n[01:26:55] started DJing.\n[01:26:56] >> I have a a reader who he would go to his\n[01:26:58] guitar lessons and he would practice\n[01:27:00] with his teacher and then he'd give him\n[01:27:01] some homework to practice certain scales\n[01:27:03] or whatever and then he would come back\n[01:27:05] and he would take his guitar, put it in\n[01:27:07] the case at the end of each um at the\n[01:27:09] end of each session and put it in the\n[01:27:11] closet. Well, he'd forget it was there\n[01:27:12] for a week and then, you know, the next\n[01:27:13] week would roll around. He'd pick it out\n[01:27:15] and go to practice and he'd be like,\n[01:27:16] \"You weren't, you know, you didn't do\n[01:27:17] this throughout the week.\" So, he bought\n[01:27:19] a guitar stand and put it in the center\n[01:27:20] of the living room. Now he passes it 30\n[01:27:23] times a day. Much more likely to pick it\n[01:27:25] up and play for 5 minutes. So it's just\n[01:27:27] making making your habits obvious. The\n[01:27:29] second law is about the craving and it's\n[01:27:31] all about making it attractive. And this\n[01:27:33] is where um I mentioned earlier like\n[01:27:35] that question of what would this look\n[01:27:36] like if it was fun. You want your habits\n[01:27:38] to be fun, compelling, attractive,\n[01:27:40] interesting to you. And the more\n[01:27:42] engaging or exciting it is, the more\n[01:27:44] likely you are to stick with it. So,\n[01:27:45] like I had one woman who she wanted to\n[01:27:48] stop going out to eat for lunch at work\n[01:27:50] every day and start bringing her lunch\n[01:27:52] in because she felt like it would be\n[01:27:53] healthier, but the idea of making like a\n[01:27:55] salad for lunch wasn't that exciting to\n[01:27:56] her. So, she came up with this phrase of\n[01:27:58] a party in a bowl. And so, she in the\n[01:28:01] beginning she would do all kinds of\n[01:28:02] stuff. She would like take potato chips\n[01:28:04] and crumble them up and put them in\n[01:28:05] there or she would like chop up Snickers\n[01:28:07] bars and put them in with the salad or\n[01:28:08] whatever. She was just trying to find a\n[01:28:10] way to make it fun. And then once she\n[01:28:12] was already bringing lunch in every day,\n[01:28:14] you know, after she did this for a month\n[01:28:16] or so, then she was like, \"All right,\n[01:28:17] I'm in the habit of bringing lunch in.\n[01:28:18] How can I start to make lunch\n[01:28:20] healthier?\" So, find a way to make your\n[01:28:21] habit attractive.\n[01:28:23] >> The third law is to make it easy. This\n[01:28:26] is all about making it simple,\n[01:28:28] frictionless, easy to do. The more\n[01:28:30] convenient or frictionless your habits\n[01:28:32] are, the more likely they are to occur.\n[01:28:34] We've talked about this a lot already,\n[01:28:36] but it's, you know, scaling your habits\n[01:28:37] down. It's using the two-minute rule to\n[01:28:39] make it, you know, as easy as you can.\n[01:28:40] But the easier a habit is to perform,\n[01:28:42] the more likely it is to happen. Daniel\n[01:28:45] Conorman, the famous psychologist, I\n[01:28:47] think he once said that if you were to\n[01:28:49] boil behavior down to like a single\n[01:28:51] principle, a single thing that drives\n[01:28:53] human behavior, it's convenience. It's\n[01:28:55] ease. You know, what is the what is the\n[01:28:56] easy thing to do? We are biological\n[01:28:58] organisms and we expend energy to live.\n[01:29:02] And it is in your best interest to try\n[01:29:04] to conserve energy whenever you can. And\n[01:29:06] so the more your brain is wired for it,\n[01:29:08] you're always looking for it. In fact,\n[01:29:10] many of the largest businesses in the\n[01:29:12] world basically just take a human desire\n[01:29:15] that we already want to do and try to\n[01:29:17] make it even more convenient. Like Door\n[01:29:19] Dash is just like, you need food, just\n[01:29:21] tap a couple times with your thumb and\n[01:29:22] we'll give it to you. I mean, in fact,\n[01:29:24] the whole arc of human history and how\n[01:29:26] we get food is just been one long path\n[01:29:28] of making it more and more convenient.\n[01:29:30] It used to be that we were hunter\n[01:29:32] gathers and had to kill our food or\n[01:29:34] forage for berries in the bush. And then\n[01:29:36] we started growing it so it was right\n[01:29:37] next to our house and we didn't have to\n[01:29:39] move. We could just harvest the corn or\n[01:29:40] the beans or whatever and eat it. And\n[01:29:42] then we started just shipping it to\n[01:29:44] grocery stores. Now you don't even have\n[01:29:45] to grow it yourself. You'll just come\n[01:29:47] over here and you can buy it and take it\n[01:29:48] home. And then we said, \"Forget it. You\n[01:29:50] don't even need to drive to the grocery\n[01:29:52] store anymore. We'll just deliver it\n[01:29:53] through Instacart or grocery delivery or\n[01:29:55] whatever.\" And now we say, \"You don't\n[01:29:57] even have to cook it in your own house\n[01:29:58] anymore. We'll just you can just order\n[01:29:59] it on Door Dash. You just tap with your\n[01:30:01] thumb and we'll bring it readymade to\n[01:30:02] you right here and you can just eat it.\n[01:30:04] It's all just one continual long arc of\n[01:30:06] making it easier and easier. And the\n[01:30:09] more that you can make your habits more\n[01:30:10] convenient, the more likely it is that\n[01:30:12] you're going to stick to it and and\n[01:30:14] follow through.\n[01:30:15] >> And then the fourth and final law is to\n[01:30:17] make it satisfying. The more satisfying\n[01:30:20] your habits are, the more likely you are\n[01:30:21] to stick to them in the future and\n[01:30:23] return to them again. The first three\n[01:30:25] laws, make it obvious, make it\n[01:30:27] attractive, and make it easy, are all\n[01:30:31] about making your habit more likely to\n[01:30:34] occur this time.\n[01:30:35] >> Mhm.\n[01:30:36] >> Make it satisfying is about increasing\n[01:30:38] the odds that you do it next time.\n[01:30:41] Because by the time you get to this\n[01:30:42] step, the habit's already occurred,\n[01:30:43] right? It's already over now. But was it\n[01:30:45] rewarding or not? Was it beneficial or\n[01:30:47] not? Did it serve you in some way? If it\n[01:30:49] serves you, if you feel like it benefits\n[01:30:51] you somehow, that marks the experience\n[01:30:54] in your brain and says, \"Hey, this was\n[01:30:56] useful. Let's come back to this next\n[01:30:58] time.\" Next time you're in a similar\n[01:31:00] situation, let's repeat this again. And\n[01:31:02] so, make it satisfying. The reward is\n[01:31:05] kind of it closes the feedback loop of\n[01:31:07] learning. You know, it increases the\n[01:31:09] odds that you're going to follow through\n[01:31:10] on it. And I use that word learning\n[01:31:12] intentionally. We're talking about\n[01:31:14] building habits, but in a way, what\n[01:31:17] we're really talking about is the\n[01:31:18] process of learning. It's the process of\n[01:31:20] how your brain and body learn what to do\n[01:31:22] as you go through life. You know, you go\n[01:31:25] throughout life and you experience\n[01:31:26] different things and you come across\n[01:31:28] different strategies and you try them\n[01:31:30] out. You know that at some point there's\n[01:31:31] the first time that you take a bite of a\n[01:31:33] pancake and then you're like, \"Oh,\n[01:31:34] that's kind of tasty. Maybe I should\n[01:31:36] take another bite.\" And other times you\n[01:31:38] try things and you're like, \"I don't\n[01:31:39] really like that that much.\" Or it\n[01:31:40] didn't really do anything. It was kind\n[01:31:41] of neutral. and your brain's like,\n[01:31:42] \"Well, maybe try something different\n[01:31:43] next time.\" So, the behaviors that are\n[01:31:45] rewarded, the behaviors that are\n[01:31:47] satisfying, the behaviors that are enjoy\n[01:31:49] enjoyable are likely to stick. And I\n[01:31:51] guess there's lots of different ways one\n[01:31:53] can make it rewarding. I was thinking\n[01:31:54] about our fitness group, which we have\n[01:31:56] on WhatsApp, where it's called Fitness\n[01:31:58] Blockchain, and every month, one person\n[01:31:59] is evicted. Every day that you go to the\n[01:32:01] gym, you take a screenshot of your\n[01:32:02] workout and drop it in there. And then\n[01:32:04] someone who's like a a freelance data\n[01:32:07] science person just kind of compiles it\n[01:32:09] all into a document and send screenshots\n[01:32:11] every day with our combined workouts.\n[01:32:12] The whole game is consistency. So it\n[01:32:13] doesn't matter how hard you worked. It's\n[01:32:14] just like did you go and that has kind\n[01:32:17] of made I don't know where that appears\n[01:32:18] on this cycle, but I think of it as like\n[01:32:20] accountability. It also makes it fun. Um\n[01:32:22] but where is that sort of social pact\n[01:32:24] element on this cycle? Is that the part\n[01:32:26] of the reward of it?\n[01:32:27] >> I think it influences all of the\n[01:32:29] behaviors, you know. So the fact that\n[01:32:30] you see other people working out is a\n[01:32:32] cue, right? So like you might get a text\n[01:32:34] of somebody else's screenshot phone.\n[01:32:36] You're like, \"Oh,\n[01:32:36] >> yeah,\n[01:32:37] >> I need to get my workout in today. I\n[01:32:38] don't want to forget.\" So that's a cue\n[01:32:39] that triggers the behavior.\n[01:32:41] >> There's something attractive about being\n[01:32:43] part of it as a group. You know that\n[01:32:44] once you post your screenshot that other\n[01:32:47] people are going to see it and like you\n[01:32:48] might get kind of rewarded for it or\n[01:32:50] like you did your thing. So that's kind\n[01:32:52] of exciting and feels motivating that\n[01:32:53] like motivates you to show up and do it.\n[01:32:56] Um sometimes you may work out with\n[01:32:57] somebody,\n[01:32:58] >> right? And so that like that there's\n[01:33:00] something there that's improving the\n[01:33:01] response. It's more it's more fun to do\n[01:33:03] it together, but it also gets you\n[01:33:04] moving. And then finally, there's the\n[01:33:06] reward of, you know, sticking to the\n[01:33:08] streak or being part of it or not\n[01:33:09] getting\n[01:33:10] >> we get the rewards. We actually there's\n[01:33:11] actually a big metal belt, a physical\n[01:33:13] belt every that's handed out every year,\n[01:33:14] but every week there's, you know, every\n[01:33:15] month there's a winner that get gets the\n[01:33:17] display picture as their face. And\n[01:33:19] >> I want the belt. That sounds cool.\n[01:33:21] >> It's got my name engraved in it. It's\n[01:33:22] like a wrestling belt.\n[01:33:24] >> That's awesome.\n[01:33:25] >> How does this work if you're trying to\n[01:33:26] break a habit? So for each of these\n[01:33:29] there are there are many ways to do each\n[01:33:32] of these things. You know there's many\n[01:33:33] ways to make habits obvious. There are\n[01:33:35] many ways to make them attractive and so\n[01:33:36] on. And what I'm giving you is just kind\n[01:33:39] of the overview of how to build a good\n[01:33:41] habit or how to install a new behavior.\n[01:33:44] If you want to break a bad habit then\n[01:33:46] you just invert these four. So rather\n[01:33:49] than making it obvious make it\n[01:33:50] invisible.\n[01:33:51] >> Okay?\n[01:33:51] >> Unsubscribe from emails. Don't keep junk\n[01:33:53] food in the house. Reduce exposure to\n[01:33:54] the queue. Rather than making it\n[01:33:56] attractive, make it unattractive. That's\n[01:33:58] the hardest one. We can talk about that\n[01:33:59] in a second. Rather than making it easy,\n[01:34:02] make it difficult. So, increase\n[01:34:03] friction, add steps between you and the\n[01:34:06] behavior. I find like here's two\n[01:34:08] examples for me. I've tried this new\n[01:34:09] thing where I keep my phone in another\n[01:34:11] room until lunch each day. So, usually\n[01:34:14] it's like 9 to 11 or so in the morning.\n[01:34:17] My phone is down the hall. It's in a\n[01:34:18] different room and I'm in my office. And\n[01:34:21] it's just a chance for me to work on my\n[01:34:23] own priorities rather than whatever's,\n[01:34:24] you know, coming in through the phone.\n[01:34:26] I'm like everybody else. If my phone is\n[01:34:28] right next to me, I will check it every\n[01:34:29] 3 minutes just because it's there. But\n[01:34:31] if it's down the hall, it's only 30\n[01:34:32] seconds away, but I never go get it. And\n[01:34:35] I always think that's interesting. You\n[01:34:36] know, it's like, did I want it or not?\n[01:34:38] In the one sense, I wanted it badly\n[01:34:40] enough that I would check it every 3\n[01:34:42] minutes when it was right by me, but I\n[01:34:43] never wanted it so bad that I'd go work\n[01:34:45] 30 seconds to go get it.\n[01:34:47] >> And I found that a lot of habits are\n[01:34:48] like that. if you just introduce a\n[01:34:50] little bit of friction, they kind of\n[01:34:51] curtail themselves to the desired\n[01:34:53] degree. So, beer is another one. I I\n[01:34:56] don't think this would work if you like,\n[01:34:58] you know, actually have an addiction or\n[01:34:59] something. But, I've noticed that if I\n[01:35:00] get like a six-ack of beer and I put it\n[01:35:02] in the front of the fridge and I open it\n[01:35:03] up and it's like right there and I can\n[01:35:05] see it. I'll have one at dinner just cuz\n[01:35:06] it's there. But, if I put it like on the\n[01:35:08] lowest shelf in the fridge, like all the\n[01:35:09] way in the back, I kind of got to bend\n[01:35:11] down to even see it. Sometimes I'll\n[01:35:13] forget. I'll have it. It'll be there for\n[01:35:14] two weeks. I won't even remember that\n[01:35:16] it's in there. Um, and so I think that's\n[01:35:19] all about like, you know, inversion of\n[01:35:20] the first law, make it invisible, and\n[01:35:22] inversion of the third law, make it\n[01:35:23] difficult. The the less likely you are\n[01:35:25] to see it, the harder it is to do, the\n[01:35:27] more steps that are involved, the less\n[01:35:28] likely it is to occur. And then the\n[01:35:30] final piece is the inversion of the last\n[01:35:32] law, which is rather than making it\n[01:35:33] satisfying, make it unsatisfying. So\n[01:35:36] layer on some kind of cost or a\n[01:35:37] consequence. And I in atomic habits, I\n[01:35:39] call this the cardinal rule of behavior\n[01:35:41] change. It's like so pervasive of a\n[01:35:43] teacher, which is behaviors that get\n[01:35:46] immediately rewarded get repeated. And\n[01:35:49] behaviors that get immediately punished\n[01:35:50] get avoided. And so obvious, but you\n[01:35:54] have to ask yourself, do you have a good\n[01:35:56] feeling when you do the thing that\n[01:35:57] you're you want to do, the habit that\n[01:35:59] you want to build? Are you getting\n[01:36:00] immediately rewarded for that? And if\n[01:36:02] you have a habit you're trying to avoid,\n[01:36:03] what is the cost? What is the\n[01:36:05] consequence? Is there something that you\n[01:36:06] know feels like a punishment there? If\n[01:36:08] so, then you're more likely to avoid it.\n[01:36:10] If not, it gets tricky.\n[01:36:12] >> It's hard, isn't it, with like there's\n[01:36:13] cookies on the counter out there. You\n[01:36:14] might have noticed them as you walked in\n[01:36:15] that you've got them on a little plate.\n[01:36:16] Loads of\n[01:36:17] >> No, but I'm going to grab one on the way\n[01:36:18] out.\n[01:36:19] >> But but I was just thinking about that\n[01:36:20] like if I have the cookie now, I'm not\n[01:36:22] going to get an immediate punishment.\n[01:36:25] The only sort of immediate punishment is\n[01:36:26] a bit of guilt that I might start to\n[01:36:28] feel that I'm now one step further away\n[01:36:30] from the goals that I've set myself in\n[01:36:31] terms of fitness. Is there any way to\n[01:36:34] bring forward the the punishment in\n[01:36:36] areas not the punishment but the the\n[01:36:38] lack the downside\n[01:36:40] >> yeah the cost of your good habits is in\n[01:36:43] the present the cost of your bad habits\n[01:36:45] is in the future and so for a lot of\n[01:36:48] your quote unquote bad habits it feels\n[01:36:50] good in the moment you know like eating\n[01:36:52] a donut feels great now playing the\n[01:36:53] video game feels great now doing you\n[01:36:55] know whatever like it's only later that\n[01:36:57] you realize oh there was a cost\n[01:36:58] associated with this even something like\n[01:37:00] the classic bad habit of smoking Maybe\n[01:37:02] you get to stand with friends outside\n[01:37:03] and socialize or maybe you reduce stress\n[01:37:05] in the moment after a long day of work.\n[01:37:07] It's only, you know, five or 10 or 20\n[01:37:09] years later that you have this\n[01:37:10] consequence. So, um, a lot of the game\n[01:37:15] of building better habits is finding\n[01:37:17] ways to pull the rewards of your good\n[01:37:20] habits into the present moment so you\n[01:37:21] feel good now. You don't have to wait\n[01:37:23] three years for it to happen. M\n[01:37:25] >> and pulling the consequences of your bad\n[01:37:27] habits into the present moment so that\n[01:37:29] you feel a little bit of the pain right\n[01:37:30] now and you realize this isn't actually\n[01:37:31] serving me.\n[01:37:33] >> Which I guess is why they put the uh the\n[01:37:34] photos of people's lungs on the\n[01:37:35] cigarette packets.\n[01:37:36] >> That's yeah like one of the things it's\n[01:37:38] trying to do right.\n[01:37:39] >> What about this um habit scorecard over\n[01:37:41] there? Is that what your parents use\n[01:37:42] with for swimming?\n[01:37:44] >> So the habit scorecard just a this is\n[01:37:46] just a simple like assessment. The\n[01:37:47] insight behind this practice is that\n[01:37:50] intentional behavior change starts with\n[01:37:52] self-awareness, right? So you will you\n[01:37:56] will change your habits all the time\n[01:37:57] whether you think about them or not.\n[01:37:59] You're you're building habits whether\n[01:38:00] you focus on it or whatever. Like your\n[01:38:02] your brain and body is built for it. Now\n[01:38:05] the more interesting question is can you\n[01:38:06] design your behavior? Can you shape your\n[01:38:09] habits in the way that you want? And\n[01:38:11] that's where self-awareness comes in.\n[01:38:12] It's very hard to shape your habits\n[01:38:14] without being aware of them. And so\n[01:38:16] there have actually been some studies\n[01:38:17] that have found that just the act of\n[01:38:19] becoming more aware of a behavior will\n[01:38:21] change it on its own. For example, there\n[01:38:23] was one study that looked at people who\n[01:38:24] journaled about their they created food\n[01:38:26] journals for what they were eating. No\n[01:38:28] tracking of anything. There's no they\n[01:38:30] were not on a diet. They're not trying\n[01:38:31] to eat certain way. They don't care\n[01:38:33] about how many calories you have.\n[01:38:34] There's no tracking or anything. All\n[01:38:36] they did was simply write down what they\n[01:38:38] ate each day. And just the act of\n[01:38:39] journaling about it changed what people\n[01:38:42] ate and reduced the the number of\n[01:38:44] calories that they had and so on just\n[01:38:46] because they were aware of what was\n[01:38:47] happening. Um and so\n[01:38:50] this is true for most habits which is\n[01:38:52] once you start to notice them then you\n[01:38:54] start to notice ways that you could\n[01:38:55] improve them or ways that you could\n[01:38:56] refine them or ways that maybe you want\n[01:38:58] to do things differently. You're not\n[01:38:59] operating as on autopilot in quite the\n[01:39:01] same way. So the habit scorecard is just\n[01:39:03] a simple way to do this. It's very it's\n[01:39:05] very simple. You just write down all the\n[01:39:06] habits that you're doing each day. So\n[01:39:08] you can start usually there's like a\n[01:39:10] package of behaviors in the beginning\n[01:39:11] and maybe around lunch and then like a\n[01:39:12] power down routine at the end of the\n[01:39:14] day. But you know it could be something\n[01:39:15] like wake up, drink a glass of water,\n[01:39:17] take a shower, you know, check my phone,\n[01:39:20] get dressed, whatever. Like you just,\n[01:39:21] you know, go through the list of what\n[01:39:22] your normal day looks like. And then\n[01:39:24] once you have the behaviors written\n[01:39:25] down, you give them a score. And the\n[01:39:27] score is just uh if it's a good habit or\n[01:39:30] a habit that you like that's\n[01:39:30] contributing to your life, you put a\n[01:39:32] plus sign. If you it's a habit that you\n[01:39:33] feel like you want to get rid of. Um\n[01:39:35] like maybe say I wake up and then I\n[01:39:37] scroll on my phone for 10 minutes before\n[01:39:38] I get out of bed. You're like, well, do\n[01:39:40] I really want to be doing that? Maybe\n[01:39:41] not. I'll give a minus sign. And then\n[01:39:43] some stuff's just neutral, you know,\n[01:39:44] like get dressed, you know, sure,\n[01:39:46] whatever. Just put a put an equal sign.\n[01:39:48] And the idea is not to judge yourself\n[01:39:51] for it. It's more like sometimes I tell\n[01:39:52] people it's almost like imagine when you\n[01:39:54] like go to the zoo and you like, you\n[01:39:55] know, look at the lions and you're like,\n[01:39:56] \"Oh, wow. How interesting that they\n[01:39:57] would do that.\" You kind of like do that\n[01:39:59] with yourself and you're like, \"Oh, how\n[01:40:00] interesting that I spend my time that\n[01:40:01] you know, you're not like trying to\n[01:40:02] judge yourself or analyze it. It's just\n[01:40:04] let me see what I'm actually spending my\n[01:40:06] time on. And then once you have that\n[01:40:08] list, I think the and this is like later\n[01:40:11] in the book, but there's um it becomes\n[01:40:13] very useful for building habit stacks\n[01:40:15] for for layering your new habits on top\n[01:40:17] of the things that you're already doing.\n[01:40:19] And so some of it self-awareness, some\n[01:40:21] of it is priming for habit stacking.\n[01:40:23] >> Habit stacking.\n[01:40:25] >> Yeah.\n[01:40:25] >> What is a habit stacking?\n[01:40:27] >> Look at this. I like these props. This\n[01:40:30] is great. All right. So, first let me\n[01:40:32] let me uh just unpack the idea. Habit\n[01:40:34] stacking is this concept that came from\n[01:40:36] Stanford professors named BJ Fog. And\n[01:40:38] his insight, which I think is great, is\n[01:40:41] that it's easier to build a new habit if\n[01:40:44] you layer it or stack it on top of an an\n[01:40:47] old habit, a habit you're already doing.\n[01:40:49] Um he calls it the tiny habits recipe, I\n[01:40:51] think. But it's the insight is just that\n[01:40:54] we all have habits that we're performing\n[01:40:57] each day and those can become anchors.\n[01:40:59] they can become cues that prompt the new\n[01:41:02] behaviors that we're going to perform.\n[01:41:04] So let's say that your current habit is\n[01:41:05] you make a cup of coffee, right? So\n[01:41:07] you're already doing this. You're going\n[01:41:08] to start each day. You're going to make\n[01:41:09] a cup of coffee. And the new habit that\n[01:41:11] you want to build is you want to start\n[01:41:13] meditating. So then you could say, \"All\n[01:41:15] right, after I make my morning cup of\n[01:41:17] coffee, I will meditate for 60 seconds.\"\n[01:41:19] So that this is just like a basic habit\n[01:41:21] stack, right? So you start you start\n[01:41:23] with coffee and then you meditate after.\n[01:41:25] Now, once you get good at this, you can\n[01:41:26] start to chain them together. So, for\n[01:41:28] example, you could say after I make my\n[01:41:30] morning cup of coffee, I will write my\n[01:41:32] to-do uh I will meditate for 60 seconds\n[01:41:34] and then I will write my to-do list for\n[01:41:35] the day. After I write my to-do list for\n[01:41:38] the day, I will prioritize them and\n[01:41:39] start working on, you know, my first\n[01:41:41] task or whatever. And now you have this\n[01:41:42] little stack that you do the same way\n[01:41:44] each morning each time. And it just is a\n[01:41:46] way to like build simple momentum and\n[01:41:48] get you in. I have I've got readers who\n[01:41:50] have made like all kinds of habit\n[01:41:52] stacks. The one of the funny ones that I\n[01:41:53] remember is one guy um he was really\n[01:41:56] into working out and he was always\n[01:41:57] drinking protein shakes, but he his\n[01:42:00] finances were kind of a mess. And so\n[01:42:02] anytime that he would make a protein\n[01:42:03] shake, he would like check his finances\n[01:42:05] and check his budget for the day. He\n[01:42:06] would like when I make a protein shake,\n[01:42:08] I fill out my daily budget. That was\n[01:42:10] like his habit stack. Um but you can do\n[01:42:12] it for anything, right? And the idea is\n[01:42:14] that you want to find a good place for\n[01:42:18] this new habit to live. You know,\n[01:42:20] sometimes like let's say let's take the\n[01:42:22] meditation example.\n[01:42:24] As a general rule, as a as a very\n[01:42:26] broadstroke rule, it tends to be better\n[01:42:28] to do habits earlier in the day rather\n[01:42:30] than later because the later it gets in\n[01:42:32] the day, the the less your day is under\n[01:42:35] your control, right? Like more things\n[01:42:37] interrupt. There's just, you know, you\n[01:42:38] run lower on time, lower on energy, and\n[01:42:40] so on.\n[01:42:41] >> So I Yeah, I like in general, I like the\n[01:42:43] idea of maybe doing meditation in the\n[01:42:45] morning. So you make your cup of coffee\n[01:42:46] and then you meditate. But if you have\n[01:42:48] like three little toddlers that you're\n[01:42:50] chasing around, you're trying to get\n[01:42:51] pants on your kids, then maybe that's\n[01:42:52] not a good time to meditate, right? It's\n[01:42:54] not it's not a good space for that habit\n[01:42:56] to live. So, I think once you've done\n[01:42:58] that habit scorecard and you have like\n[01:43:00] all of your normal habits laid out\n[01:43:02] there, you can start to think about the\n[01:43:04] new habit that you want to build and\n[01:43:05] look at that list and then say, \"Okay,\n[01:43:06] what's the appropriate place to insert\n[01:43:08] this this new habit? Where should that\n[01:43:10] new habit stack live? What's a good\n[01:43:12] trigger for that new behavior to occur?\"\n[01:43:15] And so you create these little stacks\n[01:43:16] and then it just eventually it doesn't\n[01:43:18] take that long but eventually you get\n[01:43:19] used to just doing in the same order\n[01:43:20] each time. You know like I have one\n[01:43:22] woman who she's like every day I walk\n[01:43:24] into my office, I hang up my purse, I\n[01:43:25] hang up my jacket, I go fill up my water\n[01:43:27] bottle, I sit down the desk and I answer\n[01:43:29] the first email and that's like she just\n[01:43:30] does that sequence every time she comes\n[01:43:32] in.\n[01:43:32] >> I have one I think that's kind of\n[01:43:33] related which is um and this sounds very\n[01:43:35] strange to people think I'm weird but\n[01:43:36] whatever. um is I wanted to learn how to\n[01:43:39] meditate, but in my day, the way that my\n[01:43:41] day was currently constructed, there was\n[01:43:44] no great opportunity where I'm alone for\n[01:43:46] like 10 to 20 minutes and I'm\n[01:43:49] uninterrupted and I'm and I'm in that\n[01:43:51] position. And so what I started doing is\n[01:43:53] I started meditating in the shower.\n[01:43:55] >> I'm there anyway getting clean. So it's\n[01:43:58] great. It's private, not long showers.\n[01:44:00] >> Yeah, long showers. My girlfriend's\n[01:44:02] like, \"What the [ __ ] is going on in\n[01:44:04] there sat on the floor?\" Um, but no, I\n[01:44:06] started just meditating in the shower\n[01:44:07] and it was it was really it was in the\n[01:44:09] morning alone. I'm going to do it\n[01:44:11] anyway.\n[01:44:12] >> Mh.\n[01:44:13] >> So, that really helped for me. And then\n[01:44:15] when that started to stick and I started\n[01:44:16] to get a bit of progress and see the\n[01:44:17] benefits, I can move out of the shower,\n[01:44:19] per se.\n[01:44:19] >> That's great. I had uh you're reminding\n[01:44:21] me I had a woman who came up to me after\n[01:44:23] a talk one time and told me that uh she\n[01:44:25] when she brushes she wanted to work on\n[01:44:27] her balance. She's getting older. is\n[01:44:28] getting into her 60s and she said um any\n[01:44:32] each day when I brush my teeth I brush\n[01:44:34] on one leg and I do like 10 like little\n[01:44:36] kind of half squats on that leg and then\n[01:44:38] I switch to the other leg and I do 10\n[01:44:40] more on that and she was like I'm my\n[01:44:41] balance is better my legs are stronger\n[01:44:43] and my teeth are very clean\n[01:44:46] takes a while but yeah you can pair it\n[01:44:47] up in all kinds of ways. On that point\n[01:44:49] of um doing things in the morning and\n[01:44:51] generally having less energy later in\n[01:44:53] the day, do you do you think much about\n[01:44:56] h how to manage your own energy? It's I\n[01:44:58] spoke to Dr. Lisa Feldman who's a\n[01:45:00] neuroscientist who came up with this\n[01:45:02] concept of like the the body budget that\n[01:45:04] we have this finite amount of energy.\n[01:45:06] And since then it's really had a big\n[01:45:07] impact on me because I start in so many\n[01:45:09] ways that we've talked about. One of\n[01:45:10] which is I try I try to not try and take\n[01:45:13] on too much because if in a world where\n[01:45:14] my energy on a daily basis is finite I\n[01:45:17] don't want to get to the end of my body\n[01:45:18] budget but also the order of things like\n[01:45:21] do I put my most important tasks today\n[01:45:23] >> at the beginning of the day etc etc\n[01:45:26] >> I would layer so yes I do think about\n[01:45:27] this a little bit uh and I've heard this\n[01:45:29] like you want energy management not time\n[01:45:31] management you know construct\n[01:45:32] >> the other thing that I would add to it\n[01:45:34] that I don't know that I've ever heard\n[01:45:35] anybody talk about is control so the Um,\n[01:45:40] the standard thing that everybody says\n[01:45:41] is, \"Oh, we all only have 24 hours in a\n[01:45:43] day.\" Which obviously is true, but if\n[01:45:45] you were to break that into like 24\n[01:45:47] 1-hour chunks and just look at your day\n[01:45:49] laid out that way, you have different\n[01:45:51] levels of control over certain 1 hour\n[01:45:54] chunks than others. Um, so for example,\n[01:45:56] the, you know, what I said a minute ago,\n[01:45:57] like if you have a bunch of kids and\n[01:45:58] you're getting them dressed from like\n[01:46:00] 7:00 to 8 a.m., that hour isn't that\n[01:46:02] much under your control. It's not a good\n[01:46:03] time to meditate. It's not a good time\n[01:46:05] to work out. There's other\n[01:46:06] responsibilities that tend to happen in\n[01:46:07] that hour. And so I think that's an\n[01:46:09] interesting thing too is to map your day\n[01:46:11] out and look at this and say, \"All\n[01:46:12] right, which hours are is my energy the\n[01:46:15] best and which hours are most under my\n[01:46:18] control?\" And then you can start to see\n[01:46:20] like where you're ultimately what I\n[01:46:22] think you're getting to is what are the\n[01:46:24] good hours for me? You know, like where\n[01:46:26] do those live throughout the day? And\n[01:46:28] then the next step is to ask what is\n[01:46:30] getting my best hours and what's getting\n[01:46:32] my leftovers. And I I have had a couple\n[01:46:35] different times where I've looked at\n[01:46:36] things and said, \"I say this is\n[01:46:39] important to me, but really it's only\n[01:46:40] getting my leftover hours.\" And so then\n[01:46:42] you're like, \"Okay, something might need\n[01:46:43] to change.\" So I I think about all of\n[01:46:45] that. I think about where's uh how much\n[01:46:47] time do I have in general? Where are the\n[01:46:49] pockets where I have the most energy or\n[01:46:51] the best energy? Um and then also where\n[01:46:53] are the pockets where I have the most\n[01:46:54] control? And then you try to figure out\n[01:46:56] how to slot stuff in. And theoretically,\n[01:46:57] you'd want to put the new hard habits\n[01:47:00] you're trying to form in areas where you\n[01:47:01] have the highest degree of control\n[01:47:02] versus like 11 p.m. at night.\n[01:47:04] >> Uh, right. I Yeah, I think I think in\n[01:47:06] general, that's right. It's it's so\n[01:47:07] tricky when you have multiple things\n[01:47:09] that really matter to you. You know,\n[01:47:11] it's it's like, all right, you're\n[01:47:12] choosing between family, you're choosing\n[01:47:14] between work, you're choosing between\n[01:47:15] personal pursuits and these new habits\n[01:47:16] you're trying to build. Like,\n[01:47:17] everything's got to kind of work\n[01:47:19] together. And so, it's a balance of of\n[01:47:21] shaping all of that.\n[01:47:24] So many of us are pursuing passive forms\n[01:47:26] of income and to build side businesses\n[01:47:28] in order to help us cover our bills. And\n[01:47:30] that opportunity is here with our\n[01:47:32] sponsor Stan, a business that I co-own.\n[01:47:35] It is the platform that can help you\n[01:47:36] take full advantage of your own\n[01:47:38] financial situation.

Yeah, I remember hearing about\n[01:48:18] that\n[01:48:18] >> which which um was a total nightmare.\n[01:48:20] So, I'm glad that we now use one\n[01:48:21] password.\n[01:48:22] >> What actually is it, Steve?\n[01:48:23] >> It's called um one password and they're\n[01:48:26] the sponsor of the podcast now. And they\n[01:48:27] have this feature called enterprise\n[01:48:28] password manager which means that if any\n[01:48:30] of our passwords across the team are\n[01:48:32] compromised or leaked then it notifies\n[01:48:34] us and obviously if that were to be the\n[01:48:36] case we're at huge risk across the\n[01:48:37] entire team. through one password EPM,\n[01:48:39] you can also store all of your sensitive\n[01:48:41] information and it's helping us to move\n[01:48:43] closer towards pass keys, which means\n[01:48:45] eventually everybody will be able to log\n[01:48:47] in to pretty much everything without\n[01:48:49] ever having to put a password in.\n[01:48:50] >> Sounds like a good addition.\n[01:48:51] >> Yeah, I think it's like the single most\n[01:48:53] impactful security addition you can make\n[01:48:55] to your team, especially if your team\n[01:48:56] has tons of passwords that are all like\n[01:48:58] hidden in Excel files and stuff. To my\n[01:49:00] listeners, if you want to secure your\n[01:49:01] business, head to onepass.com/doac.\n[01:49:05] One password is a game changer. It's the\n[01:49:07] future that I always wished would be the\n[01:49:08] case as someone that has, you know, 20,\n[01:49:10] 30 different passwords for 20, 30\n[01:49:12] different applications.\n[01:49:14] The first time we made our little\n[01:49:16] fitness group on WhatsApp, it was about\n[01:49:17] how many calories you could burn.\n[01:49:19] >> And that was what awarded you the points\n[01:49:21] and won the competition. Didn't last\n[01:49:22] long.\n[01:49:24] >> Didn't last long for a number of\n[01:49:26] reasons. Kind of toxic, unfair, because\n[01:49:28] I have I weigh more than anyone in the\n[01:49:29] group, so I burn more calories just by\n[01:49:31] standing up. Um, and then it moved to\n[01:49:32] this this idea of consistency. How do\n[01:49:34] you think about what is better? Is it\n[01:49:36] better to be consistent or is it better\n[01:49:37] to be something else?\n[01:49:40] >> I feel like there there's this story\n[01:49:41] that people tell themselves a lot which\n[01:49:43] is they want to do the big impressive\n[01:49:44] thing, you know, like you want to do um\n[01:49:46] you want to run a marathon, you want to\n[01:49:48] do a week-l long silent meditation\n[01:49:50] retreat, you want to, you know, write\n[01:49:51] the bestselling book, whatever. And I I\n[01:49:53] think about it as this balance between\n[01:49:55] consistency and intensity. So intensity\n[01:49:59] is a good story. It's I I ran the\n[01:50:02] marathon. I did the silent meditation\n[01:50:03] retreat. consistency actually makes\n[01:50:06] progress. You know, it's I meditate for\n[01:50:07] five minutes each day. I run, you know,\n[01:50:09] three days a week or whatever. And so,\n[01:50:11] people need consistency more than they\n[01:50:13] need intensity. And in fact, what I\n[01:50:16] would say is\n[01:50:18] consistency enlarges ability.\n[01:50:20] Consistency enlarges ability. It's the\n[01:50:23] act of showing up consistently that\n[01:50:25] builds your capacity to do something,\n[01:50:28] that fosters the skill development and\n[01:50:30] growth that you want. And so showing up,\n[01:50:33] even if it's just in a small way, is the\n[01:50:35] way that you actually create the\n[01:50:37] opportunity to do something more intense\n[01:50:39] or more impressive down the line.\n[01:50:42] I also think that there's this\n[01:50:45] deep important lesson that comes from\n[01:50:48] appreciating consistency and what's\n[01:50:50] required there. Consistency\n[01:50:54] is often adaptability. It's flexibility.\n[01:50:57] There's this there's this story about\n[01:50:58] like mental toughness and being discip\n[01:51:00] like being a disciplined person that um\n[01:51:03] that we tell ourselves that's something\n[01:51:04] like you know I grind to make sure this\n[01:51:06] happens. I will I will you know make it\n[01:51:08] happen no matter what the circumstances\n[01:51:10] like that the mentally tough person\n[01:51:12] pushes through regardless of what they\n[01:51:14] face. But I think that in real life a\n[01:51:16] lot of the time consistency is actually\n[01:51:18] being flexible. It's being adaptable.\n[01:51:19] You know if you don't have enough energy\n[01:51:21] you do the easier version. If you don't\n[01:51:22] have enough time you do the short\n[01:51:23] version. You find a way to not throw up\n[01:51:25] a zero that day. you find a way to show\n[01:51:27] up even if it's not ideal. And that is\n[01:51:30] actually being very mentally tough. And\n[01:51:32] so the the adaptable person is the one\n[01:51:36] that um what's that line? It's uh when\n[01:51:39] the storm came, the oak tree fought it\n[01:51:40] and broke, but the willow bent and\n[01:51:42] survived. And so it's like you need a\n[01:51:44] way to manage the storms of life and\n[01:51:46] bend with them while still showing up.\n[01:51:49] If you purely fight against it, you\n[01:51:51] think that you'd think that being tough,\n[01:51:53] that being mentally tough is like, I'm\n[01:51:55] gonna make sure this happens. But it\n[01:51:57] actually makes you somewhat brittle. You\n[01:51:59] know, you need it to be a certain way.\n[01:52:01] And when you need life to be a certain\n[01:52:03] way to succeed, you become held hostage\n[01:52:06] by the situation.\n[01:52:08] >> You know, you need it to be just like\n[01:52:09] that. But if in fact you can be\n[01:52:11] adaptable and you can be flexible, now\n[01:52:13] you are actually more resilient. Um, and\n[01:52:15] so I think there's a a balance to strike\n[01:52:17] there. and it it feeds into the\n[01:52:19] consistency that will ultimately uh\n[01:52:21] enlarge your ability.\n[01:52:22] >> I think this is such an important point\n[01:52:24] that I don't often hear people talk\n[01:52:25] about. It reminds me of my friend. My\n[01:52:27] friend, one of my best friends, he has a\n[01:52:29] tendency to feel like he's cracked\n[01:52:31] fitness. And what tends to happen is\n[01:52:33] he'll work out and go to the gym for\n[01:52:35] like 3 months and he'll then announce\n[01:52:36] that he's finally cracked it like the\n[01:52:39] consistency, the motivation. And the\n[01:52:40] minute he does that is like 30 days\n[01:52:43] before he falls off again because I\n[01:52:44] think I think he gets complacent. Life\n[01:52:46] is going to happen. And I remember\n[01:52:47] saying to him one one year, I mean, I've\n[01:52:48] known him for 15 years now. I was like,\n[01:52:50] um, the thing I've come to learn about\n[01:52:52] the gym and fitness is that you never\n[01:52:54] crack it. And actually, the mindset that\n[01:52:55] every single day I could fall off and\n[01:52:58] that life happens has helped me be\n[01:53:01] consistent. Whereas a version of me in\n[01:53:03] 2017 set this ridiculous goal, which was\n[01:53:06] I was going to go to the gym every\n[01:53:07] single day without fail. And then five\n[01:53:09] months in where life happened and I\n[01:53:11] missed a day, my motivations was gone\n[01:53:13] and I fell off. You see this a lot with\n[01:53:16] top performers in in many different\n[01:53:17] domains, which is it's not that they\n[01:53:19] don't make mistakes or they don't slip\n[01:53:21] up. Everybody slips up, but they tend to\n[01:53:23] get back on track quickly. And so really\n[01:53:26] what you need is not a perfect plan or\n[01:53:29] like a system that never fails. What you\n[01:53:31] need is a good plan for getting back on\n[01:53:32] track. You need if the reclaiming of a\n[01:53:35] habit is fast, the breaking of it\n[01:53:37] doesn't matter that much. You get to the\n[01:53:38] end of the year and it's just like a\n[01:53:39] little blip on the radar, but you need a\n[01:53:41] good plan for getting back on track\n[01:53:43] quickly. So, I I think that uh some of\n[01:53:45] the balance, some of the some of the\n[01:53:47] strategy is actually knowing what to do\n[01:53:49] when you fail.\n[01:53:50] >> Yeah.\n[01:53:51] >> Um and if you if you figure that out,\n[01:53:53] then uh you're in a good position to\n[01:53:54] bounce back quickly.\n[01:53:55] >> Funnily enough, when I fail, when I fall\n[01:53:57] off my gym workout or whatever, what I\n[01:53:59] do is I I set the display picture on my\n[01:54:01] iPhone to red. And I guess this is a\n[01:54:03] point of self-awareness. It just reminds\n[01:54:05] me that we've currently fallen off. That\n[01:54:06] means every time I look at my phone,\n[01:54:07] it's a reminder that this is code red.\n[01:54:10] >> Wow, that's great. What a strong visual\n[01:54:12] sign. Yeah. And that I need to start\n[01:54:14] doing the small steps, doing the [ __ ]\n[01:54:15] workouts again,\n[01:54:17] >> you know. So, I have this um I have this\n[01:54:18] little theory that the secret to winning\n[01:54:21] is actually learning how to lose. It's\n[01:54:22] that the secret to winning is knowing\n[01:54:24] how to lose. Um and what I mean is that\n[01:54:26] it's knowing how to handle a loss. It's\n[01:54:29] knowing how to rebound and bounce back\n[01:54:31] from that. I think that I learned it\n[01:54:34] through sports. I don't think sports is\n[01:54:35] the only way you can learn it. I think\n[01:54:36] probably anything that you do with some\n[01:54:38] level of public visibility could teach\n[01:54:40] you. you know, musical performance or\n[01:54:41] being in a fitness group with your\n[01:54:42] friends or there's lots of ways you do\n[01:54:44] it, speaking publicly.\n[01:54:45] >> But one thing about sports is that\n[01:54:48] you're going to fail in front of the\n[01:54:49] rest of the team, you know, like the\n[01:54:51] ball will come to you'll start make the\n[01:54:52] strikeout to end the game or like you\n[01:54:54] know, you go uh into the gym and work\n[01:54:56] out with the team and like you miss a\n[01:54:57] lift or you're the weak one or whatever.\n[01:54:59] Like that doesn't feel good, but then\n[01:55:00] you realize life moves on and you got to\n[01:55:02] go on to the next set and you have to\n[01:55:03] show up again the next time. And each\n[01:55:05] little instance where there's like a\n[01:55:07] little failure like that is practice for\n[01:55:10] you to bounce back again. And I think\n[01:55:12] it's important to have something in life\n[01:55:14] that's like that that's teaching you how\n[01:55:16] to respond to failure. That you're\n[01:55:18] learning how to lose and how to bounce\n[01:55:20] back from a loss so that you can\n[01:55:21] ultimately win. I got to the point at\n[01:55:23] the end of my career um my senior year\n[01:55:26] where I was basically like listen I\n[01:55:28] don't want to lose but if we're going to\n[01:55:30] lose I'd rather it be me. I'd rather be\n[01:55:32] out there. Give it put it on my\n[01:55:33] shoulders. I can take the loss, you\n[01:55:34] know, I can I can handle it. I I'll give\n[01:55:36] you everything I have to try to get us\n[01:55:37] to win, but if we lose, like, I'll be\n[01:55:39] able to bounce back from it. And I think\n[01:55:41] that that ended up serving me really\n[01:55:42] well in my entrepreneurial career\n[01:55:44] because stuff is never going to go your\n[01:55:46] way all the time. Um, and you need to be\n[01:55:48] able to try, be willing to try things\n[01:55:51] and be willing to sometimes look foolish\n[01:55:53] because of them and still find a way to\n[01:55:56] show back up the next time.\n[01:55:57] >> Reminds me of watching Roger Fedra's\n[01:56:00] commencement speech. He's arguably the\n[01:56:02] best tennis player of all time. And\n[01:56:03] shockingly, in his commencement speech,\n[01:56:04] I don't know if you saw it, he talks\n[01:56:06] about how in his career he's missed\n[01:56:09] something like 47% of the points. So,\n[01:56:11] he's the best to ever do it. And he's he\n[01:56:14] only in his career has won 53% of the\n[01:56:18] points, which means that half the time\n[01:56:20] he's taking L's. But the difference is\n[01:56:22] what he does when he takes the L and not\n[01:56:25] allowing that L that that missed point\n[01:56:27] to compound into what his next shot. M\n[01:56:29] and I was in LA with my friends for my\n[01:56:31] birthday. My friend Ash, who's had the\n[01:56:33] most paddle training. We were playing\n[01:56:35] paddle. We do, that's what we do\n[01:56:36] basically all the time when we see each\n[01:56:37] other, our group of friends. He'd had\n[01:56:39] the most paddle training. He's been in\n[01:56:41] Spain with a coach. But when he lost a\n[01:56:45] point, he would then start losing easy\n[01:56:47] points. And there's this photo of me\n[01:56:48] watching him play and I'm like, \"What\n[01:56:49] the hell's going on with him?\" Like,\n[01:56:50] he's the best. He's meant to be the best\n[01:56:51] player. He's got the most practice, most\n[01:56:53] repetitions. But when he loses a point,\n[01:56:55] this downward spiral takes place where\n[01:56:57] he just starts missing easy shots. So\n[01:56:58] when he sat down, I told him about Rod\n[01:57:00] Roer Fedra's thing. And I gave him this\n[01:57:02] little idea in his head to to handle the\n[01:57:04] loss. And I said to him, when you lose\n[01:57:06] the point, say in your head, that point\n[01:57:08] doesn't matter. I'm going to win this\n[01:57:10] game anyway because I am the better\n[01:57:12] player. And I still get goosebumps when\n[01:57:14] I say it because he went from being the\n[01:57:16] fifth best in our group of five to\n[01:57:18] beating all of us\n[01:57:19] >> immediately.\n[01:57:21] >> And there's there's it's so funny cuz my\n[01:57:23] girlfriend and everyone here knows like\n[01:57:24] he was like dancing through the house\n[01:57:25] the same day. He beat all of us. I had\n[01:57:27] never been beaten by him. I have a pal\n[01:57:28] in my garden. Like he beat me\n[01:57:30] immediately. And all it was was was\n[01:57:33] making sure that when he took an L, he\n[01:57:35] didn't spiral into his emot the\n[01:57:37] emotional center of his brain and start\n[01:57:38] catastrophizing which he's susceptible\n[01:57:40] to if you know him. He went straight\n[01:57:42] back into the prefrontal cortex, the\n[01:57:43] rational center of his brain. And he and\n[01:57:44] he said he and you know he's posted\n[01:57:46] about it online and I actually part of\n[01:57:47] my Asia tour recently was I showed all\n[01:57:49] the videos and all the WhatsApp messages\n[01:57:50] of this whole thing happening. But it\n[01:57:52] just goes to show that actually it's how\n[01:57:53] you take the L.\n[01:57:55] >> I love those mindset shifts. It's just a\n[01:57:57] it's living life with a next play\n[01:57:59] mentality,\n[01:58:00] >> you know? It's like you don't let the\n[01:58:01] last play dictate you or like ruin you.\n[01:58:03] It's we have to move on and make the\n[01:58:05] next best choice now. We have to we have\n[01:58:06] to live for the next play. Um\n[01:58:08] >> and how much emotion just like ruins our\n[01:58:10] training.\n[01:58:11] >> Sure.\n[01:58:11] >> You know.\n[01:58:12] >> Yeah. I feel like a lot of this is\n[01:58:13] there's a great book Inner Game of\n[01:58:15] Tennis um that came out many many years\n[01:58:17] ago. Might even be 50 at this point. Um\n[01:58:19] but it's basically all about this. It's\n[01:58:21] about not getting in your head. And it's\n[01:58:23] it's specifically for tennis, but it\n[01:58:25] applies to life, you know. It's it's\n[01:58:27] just about um yeah, it's moving on and\n[01:58:29] having this next play mentality.\n[01:58:30] >> So David Braford said that to me as well\n[01:58:32] about one of his main objectives when he\n[01:58:34] had the cycling team was to get them not\n[01:58:35] to think about the race while they were\n[01:58:38] on the race. And he said, I think it was\n[01:58:39] Chris Chris Hoy or someone. He said my\n[01:58:41] entire training with Chris Hoy was\n[01:58:43] getting him to stop thinking about the\n[01:58:45] current race he was in. and that when\n[01:58:47] Chris was hit his personal bests, he\n[01:58:49] would get off the the bike and have no\n[01:58:51] recollection of cycling.\n[01:58:53] >> He goes to the point that it was like he\n[01:58:55] was asleep on the bike because when the\n[01:58:57] alternative meant that Chris would start\n[01:58:58] thinking about his time and then cycling\n[01:59:00] too hard and exhausting himself and fall\n[01:59:02] out of his his training. So, fascinating\n[01:59:04] fascinating um you talk about daily\n[01:59:06] mental mindsets as well. Is it important\n[01:59:09] to adopt a particular daily mental\n[01:59:10] mindset? Well, I um I had this thought\n[01:59:13] that uh\n[01:59:15] one time I had this thought that it\n[01:59:16] would be cool to be able to hire a\n[01:59:17] mental performance coach who just did\n[01:59:19] one thing. So you you hire this coach\n[01:59:21] and then they call you up each morning\n[01:59:22] like 8 a.m. or something and they give\n[01:59:24] you like a five minute pep talk, you\n[01:59:26] know, or just they give you like a five\n[01:59:28] minute mindset shift, just something\n[01:59:29] little kind of like what you said to\n[01:59:30] your friend, you know, and just like you\n[01:59:32] get this little mindset shift to reset\n[01:59:34] your day and go into it with momentum\n[01:59:36] and they hang up and you just go do your\n[01:59:38] thing. Um, and you know, I I couldn't\n[01:59:40] find anybody who, you know, could do\n[01:59:42] that, but I've been working on this\n[01:59:43] little project where I've been trying to\n[01:59:44] figure out how to do it. And so, I came\n[01:59:46] up with, it sounds almost kind of silly,\n[01:59:48] but I'm really excited about it. I came\n[01:59:49] up with this Atomic Habits daily\n[01:59:51] calendar. And the idea is just, it's\n[01:59:54] actually like a blend of Atomic Habits,\n[01:59:55] Principles, and 321, which is my weekly\n[01:59:57] newsletter. And I just have like one\n[01:59:59] little mindset shift that's on each\n[02:00:01] page. And it's just one page for each\n[02:00:02] day of the year. You just look at it,\n[02:00:04] read that page, boom, go into your day.\n[02:00:06] And like it's just intended to be a\n[02:00:07] little mindset shift. Anyway, it's a\n[02:00:08] it's just a small thing, but I like I\n[02:00:10] like the idea of priming yourself to\n[02:00:12] start the day in the right way. And um I\n[02:00:15] don't know. I didn't think that I would\n[02:00:16] be excited about a calendar, but I'm I'm\n[02:00:18] kind of excited about it. I kind of feel\n[02:00:20] like it it could be good. So,\n[02:00:21] >> is it coming out?\n[02:00:22] >> Yes, it'll be out in uh it'll be out\n[02:00:24] soon. Yeah.\n[02:00:24] >> Okay. And where where would we find\n[02:00:26] that? Do we sign up to the\n[02:00:27] >> uh It's on Amazon. You can you can go\n[02:00:28] there or you know, you can go to\n[02:00:29] jamesclair.com and you'll you'll find it\n[02:00:31] there. But um yeah,\n[02:00:33] >> so this book, the Atomic Habits\n[02:00:35] Workbook, Simple Exercises for Building\n[02:00:37] the Life You Want is now out. It came\n[02:00:39] out this week. What is this the\n[02:00:42] distinction between these two books? If\n[02:00:43] I read Atomic Habits already,\n[02:00:45] >> let me have a book. All right. So, um\n[02:00:48] Atomic Habits is\n[02:00:52] the culmination of basically 10 years of\n[02:00:54] work and effort for me. Um, it's like I\n[02:00:58] my objective was to write the best book\n[02:01:01] that's ever been written on habits. Now,\n[02:01:03] I don't know that I achieved that or\n[02:01:04] not. That's for the readers to decide,\n[02:01:06] but I don't think you're ever going to\n[02:01:08] just stumble into that result. You know,\n[02:01:09] like you have to at least strive for it.\n[02:01:11] Um, and so that was the hope is that\n[02:01:13] everything that you would could possibly\n[02:01:16] need to know about building good habits\n[02:01:17] and breaking bad ones should be in\n[02:01:19] Atomic Habits. So then you're like,\n[02:01:21] okay, why would I need a workbook? Um,\n[02:01:23] but uh what I've learned over the last\n[02:01:26] seven years of this being out and\n[02:01:27] selling 25 million copies is that people\n[02:01:30] always need more tangible practical help\n[02:01:32] with implementing their habits. So,\n[02:01:35] Atomic Habits is the full guide and the\n[02:01:38] philosophy and the approach on how to do\n[02:01:40] it. Then you finish this book and you\n[02:01:42] sit there and you say, \"All right,\n[02:01:43] great. I have some habits I want to\n[02:01:45] build. How do I do that?\" And the\n[02:01:47] exercises in the workbook are intended\n[02:01:49] to help you do that. They help you look\n[02:01:50] at your environment and figure out how\n[02:01:52] do I optimize it? They help you look at\n[02:01:54] your goals and how do I translate it\n[02:01:55] into a system. They help you look at\n[02:01:57] your desired identity and how are my\n[02:01:59] habits reinforcing it. So it's just a\n[02:02:01] series of exercises that help you apply\n[02:02:03] and implement the ideas from atomic\n[02:02:05] habits.\n[02:02:05] >> The great thing about the way that you\n[02:02:06] write is it's so unbelievably\n[02:02:08] accessible. So unbelievably accessible\n[02:02:10] in the context which means that you\n[02:02:12] don't need to be a scientist or an\n[02:02:14] expert to understand the concepts. And I\n[02:02:16] think that's why the book has been\n[02:02:17] atomic habits has been so unbelievably\n[02:02:18] successful. This book, the workbook,\n[02:02:20] follows in the same vein. It allows\n[02:02:22] people at all levels of their knowledge\n[02:02:24] of habits and intellect to get going and\n[02:02:27] to start sort of holding themselves\n[02:02:28] accountable. I'd say accountability is a\n[02:02:30] huge part of this. I kind of see\n[02:02:31] elements of that fitness group I\n[02:02:33] described, fitness blockchain, just\n[02:02:34] because you're reflecting and you're\n[02:02:36] writing down what happened. And um like\n[02:02:38] you said earlier about how just\n[02:02:40] journaling increases the likelihood of a\n[02:02:43] behavior. Um this book will raise your\n[02:02:45] self-awareness. Yes, that's a good\n[02:02:47] that's actually a great summary of it. I\n[02:02:49] think it uh it makes you more aware of\n[02:02:51] your habits and your environment and\n[02:02:53] what you're trying to do specifically\n[02:02:54] rather than just understanding the\n[02:02:55] concepts.\n[02:02:57] >> James, thank you. Thank you for um\n[02:02:58] changing so many people's lives. You\n[02:03:00] must hear this all the time, but what a\n[02:03:02] remarkable remarkable um impact you must\n[02:03:05] have had on so many people you'll never\n[02:03:08] get to meet. Getting them to quit habits\n[02:03:10] that would have otherwise been fatal for\n[02:03:12] them. You know, my dad is a prime\n[02:03:13] example of someone who was smoking for\n[02:03:16] 20 odd years of his life. He starts\n[02:03:17] reading about these habit cycles in your\n[02:03:19] work, but in other people's work as\n[02:03:20] well, and he's quit smoking and that's\n[02:03:22] probably extended his life to some\n[02:03:24] degree. And that's one such example of\n[02:03:26] I'd say 25 million because I know the\n[02:03:28] Atomic Habits has sold 25 million, but\n[02:03:30] you've reached many many many millions\n[02:03:32] of people through your newsletter as\n[02:03:34] well, 321. um which is the I mean the\n[02:03:37] newsletter has kind of created a\n[02:03:39] blueprint for anyone that writes a\n[02:03:41] newsletter. Frankly, I think everybody\n[02:03:43] looks up to your work and what you've\n[02:03:44] built as the the framework for starting\n[02:03:46] their own newsletters. And you know, you\n[02:03:49] never get you'll never get to see the\n[02:03:50] downstream impact of the work you've\n[02:03:52] done. But on behalf of everybody who's\n[02:03:54] had their life ch changed because of the\n[02:03:56] hard work you've put in and your\n[02:03:57] obsession and your focus and your\n[02:03:59] passion and these incredible works of\n[02:04:01] art that you've written and that you\n[02:04:02] didn't rush. Um, thank you and thank you\n[02:04:05] on behalf of myself because your h your\n[02:04:06] work has been super formative in how I\n[02:04:08] think about business, how I think about\n[02:04:10] my team. Um, and many of the phrases\n[02:04:12] that we use in our office every single\n[02:04:13] day to build the companies we've built\n[02:04:14] have come from your work as well.\n[02:04:16] Everybody needs to go out. I mean, if\n[02:04:18] you don't have Atomic Habits, then I\n[02:04:19] don't know what you've been doing with\n[02:04:20] your life. But, um, now that the Atomic\n[02:04:22] Habits workbook is here, you now have a\n[02:04:24] much more um, self-awareness inducing,\n[02:04:28] practical, hands-on framework for\n[02:04:31] implementing some of the stuff you've\n[02:04:32] read in Atomic Habits. Now, I'm going to\n[02:04:33] link both of them below so everybody can\n[02:04:35] go grab them. But also, your James'\n[02:04:36] newsletter is phenomenal. So, I'll link\n[02:04:38] that below as well. We do have a closing\n[02:04:40] tradition on this podcast where the last\n[02:04:42] guest leaves a question for the next\n[02:04:43] guest not knowing who they're leaving it\n[02:04:44] for.\n[02:04:45] >> Question that has been left for you.\n[02:04:47] Dear next person in the chat,\n[02:04:50] what do you believe is the best way to\n[02:04:53] unify people of differing or even\n[02:04:56] conflicting beliefs?\n[02:04:59] Let me know your thoughts. Best Kamal\n[02:05:01] Harris. I think the best way is to scale\n[02:05:03] it down. You know, if you say, \"How can\n[02:05:05] we have a more unified nation, it's big,\n[02:05:07] it's vague, it's it's almost impossible,\n[02:05:09] it's like an intractable level.\" But if\n[02:05:11] you scale it down now, you can come up\n[02:05:13] with things. You know, how can you have\n[02:05:14] a more unified neighborhood? You could\n[02:05:16] start a book club or do a block party or\n[02:05:18] you can come up with all kinds of things\n[02:05:19] that you could do. And what you find is\n[02:05:21] that in many cases in life, problems are\n[02:05:24] intractable at a certain level, at a\n[02:05:25] certain scale. And if you shift what\n[02:05:28] level you're at, suddenly it reveals\n[02:05:30] itself and there's a new solution. And\n[02:05:32] so I think that is obviously true uh\n[02:05:34] with big picture things like like the\n[02:05:36] question I was asked but it's also true\n[02:05:38] for your habits. You know if you think\n[02:05:40] about your life in general and you say\n[02:05:41] how can I have a better life or how can\n[02:05:43] I figure out my purpose? How can I\n[02:05:44] figure out you know how to have a life\n[02:05:46] of meaning? These are big hard\n[02:05:48] questions. They're sometimes they're\n[02:05:49] almost intractable. They're too vague.\n[02:05:51] They're too broad. But if you can scale\n[02:05:53] it down and say how can I live a good\n[02:05:55] day today or how can I have a good week?\n[02:05:58] How can I have um you know a good next\n[02:06:00] hour? how can I make this minute as\n[02:06:02] perfect as possible? Well, those those\n[02:06:04] levels are much more achievable. And so,\n[02:06:06] I think if you scale your habits down to\n[02:06:08] a level that's more solvable, you'll\n[02:06:10] often see that there's a path forward\n[02:06:12] there.\n[02:06:12] >> What's interesting with your\n[02:06:13] neighborhood analogy as well is that\n[02:06:15] neighborhoods are interconnected.\n[02:06:17] >> So, if I if I focus on making my\n[02:06:18] neighborhood good, then that kind of\n[02:06:21] just crosses over with the next\n[02:06:22] neighborhood. Like thinking about my\n[02:06:23] street where I used to live\n[02:06:24] >> and so if that neighborhood becomes\n[02:06:26] good, it's going to then hit the next\n[02:06:27] domino, which is the neighborhood next\n[02:06:28] door. and then eventually called\n[02:06:30] >> which is also true for your personal\n[02:06:32] life. You know your each unit of time\n[02:06:34] each little habit is connected. You know\n[02:06:36] you put your habits together and you\n[02:06:37] kind of end up with this system of\n[02:06:38] behaviors that influence your day and\n[02:06:40] your week. So mastering this hour makes\n[02:06:43] the next hour a little bit better as\n[02:06:44] well.\n[02:06:45] >> There's I ultimately chose the phrase\n[02:06:47] atomic habits for three reasons. There's\n[02:06:49] there's three meanings to the word\n[02:06:50] atomic. The first is tiny or small like\n[02:06:52] an atom which obviously I think your\n[02:06:53] habit should be small and easy to do.\n[02:06:55] The second meaning is the one we're\n[02:06:57] talking about now and the one people\n[02:06:58] often forget which is an atom is a\n[02:07:00] fundamentally unit in a larger system.\n[02:07:02] So atoms build in molecules, molecules\n[02:07:04] build in compounds and so on. And your\n[02:07:06] habits are kind of like the little units\n[02:07:08] of your day. You know, collectively you\n[02:07:09] put them together and you have your\n[02:07:10] daily routine. And then the third\n[02:07:12] meaning is the source of immense energy\n[02:07:14] or power. And so if you put all three of\n[02:07:16] these together, you kind of understand\n[02:07:18] the narrative arc of the book, which is\n[02:07:20] you make changes that are small and easy\n[02:07:22] to do. You layer them together like\n[02:07:24] units in a larger system and\n[02:07:26] collectively you get this powerful\n[02:07:28] remarkable result as a process and so or\n[02:07:30] as a consequence and that is the idea\n[02:07:32] behind atomic habits. You make these\n[02:07:34] small changes and it's not just one it's\n[02:07:36] like a hundred or a thousand of them and\n[02:07:38] collectively they come together to\n[02:07:39] create this powerful impressive life.\n[02:07:42] >> Powerful impressive life. Do you think\n[02:07:45] that we should all be aiming at this is\n[02:07:47] a bit of an interesting word but\n[02:07:50] happiness is that should that is that\n[02:07:52] the north star that our habits should\n[02:07:54] ladder up towards or fulfillment or\n[02:07:55] whatever one might say or meaning\n[02:07:58] for first of all I think we should\n[02:08:00] distinguish between happiness and\n[02:08:01] meaning you know or happiness and\n[02:08:03] purpose or something fulfillment I don't\n[02:08:05] think they're necessarily the same you\n[02:08:06] know like there are many moments in my\n[02:08:08] life when I am happy uh and that can be\n[02:08:10] in the moment and a lot of the most\n[02:08:12] meaningful things that I worked on you\n[02:08:13] know atomic habits was one of the most\n[02:08:15] meaningful projects that I've worked on.\n[02:08:16] It seems to have made a big difference\n[02:08:17] for a lot of people or helped a lot of\n[02:08:19] people. I feel great about that. But I\n[02:08:21] wasn't necessarily happy every minute\n[02:08:22] that I was working on it. You know, like\n[02:08:24] it was it was quite difficult in lots of\n[02:08:25] different times and it took a long time\n[02:08:27] and it was arduous and so on, but it\n[02:08:28] provides a lot of meaning. So, I\n[02:08:30] definitely think it was worth it even if\n[02:08:31] I wasn't always happy in the moment. So,\n[02:08:33] I don't know that you should necessarily\n[02:08:35] optimize for any of that all the time.\n[02:08:37] Um, you know, I don't think your habits\n[02:08:38] will lead you to some place where you\n[02:08:40] are just permanently happy. Um, but\n[02:08:45] they will definitely take you on a\n[02:08:46] journey where happiness is part of it\n[02:08:48] and where meaning can be part of it. Um,\n[02:08:51] and there are lots of other things that\n[02:08:52] are parts of life too. But, uh, yeah, I\n[02:08:55] I think that you will be well served to\n[02:08:57] invest in them for sure.\n[02:08:58] >> James, thank you so much. It's been\n[02:08:59] >> Thank you. And thank you so much for\n[02:09:00] saying those kind things. That's uh\n[02:09:01] that's very nice of you. Um, I have been\n[02:09:06] incredibly\n[02:09:07] lucky and blown away by the reception to\n[02:09:09] the book and um, it just feels it feels\n[02:09:13] great to know that people are finding it\n[02:09:14] useful. You know, all I wanted to do was\n[02:09:16] try to be useful and helpful and um, I\n[02:09:18] appreciate you saying that and I'm I'm\n[02:09:20] grateful that many other people have\n[02:09:21] found it helpful as well.\n[02:09:22] >> Yeah, I don't think you'll ever realize,\n[02:09:25] you know, you see 25 million people have\n[02:09:26] bought the book, but it's much bigger\n[02:09:28] than that. It's it's billions of people\n[02:09:29] have been impacted by that because\n[02:09:30] everybody is like a like a pebble thrown\n[02:09:33] into the ocean, right? There's these\n[02:09:34] ripple effects that go on and it changes\n[02:09:35] their professional life, their personal\n[02:09:36] life, their health, their friendships,\n[02:09:37] relationships. So, it's unbelievable.\n[02:09:39] Thank you, James. Thank you. Thank you.\n[02:09:44] This is something that I've made for\n[02:09:46] you. I realize that the Dio audience are\n[02:09:48] strivals\n[02:09:52] that we want to accomplish. And one of\n[02:09:53] the things I've learned is that when you\n[02:09:56] aim at the big big big goal, it can feel\n[02:09:58] incredibly psychologically uncomfortable\n[02:10:01] because it's kind of like being stood at\n[02:10:03] the foot of Mount Everest and looking\n[02:10:04] upwards. The way to accomplish your\n[02:10:06] goals is by breaking them down into tiny\n[02:10:09] small steps. And we call this in our\n[02:10:11] team the 1%. And actually this\n[02:10:13] philosophy is highly responsible for\n[02:10:15] much of our success here. So, what we've\n[02:10:17] done so that you at home can accomplish\n[02:10:19] any big goal that you have is we've made\n[02:10:22] these 1% diaries and we released these\n[02:10:24] last year and they all sold out. So, I\n[02:10:27] asked my team over and over again to\n[02:10:28] bring the diaries back, but also to\n[02:10:30] introduce some new colors and to make\n[02:10:31] some minor tweaks to the diary. So, now\n[02:10:33] we have a better range for you. So, if\n[02:10:38] you have a big goal in mind and you need\n[02:10:39] a framework and a process and some\n[02:10:41] motivation, then I highly recommend you\n[02:10:44] get one of these diaries before they all\n[02:10:46] sell out once again. And you can get\n[02:10:47] yours now at the diary.com where you can\n[02:10:49] get 20% off our Black Friday bundle. And\n[02:10:52] if you want the link, the link is in the\n[02:10:54] description below.\n[02:11:05] Heat. Heat.",
