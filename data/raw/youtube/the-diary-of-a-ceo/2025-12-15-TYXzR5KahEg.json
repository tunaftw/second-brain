  "transcript": "[00:00] People really care about what's making\n[00:02] them disliked. And they really want to\n[00:03] know how to be liked.\n[00:04] >> Okay. So, first, this is an exercise\n[00:06] that I do in my class at Harvard called\n[00:08] 10 questions to fall in like.\n[00:10] >> So, if I ask someone those questions,\n[00:11] they're going to like me.\n[00:12] >> It's a great starting point, but let's\n[00:14] talk about this because they're going to\n[00:15] be little clues about how to be better\n[00:17] liked. And it's the most teachable,\n[00:20] practical, scientifically rigorous\n[00:22] framework in the world for\n[00:23] communication. Do you want to hear about\n[00:25] it, Stephen?\n[00:25] >> Of course I want to hear about it. I\n[00:26] want to be the most persuasive,\n[00:28] influential, likable talker in the\n[00:30] world. So, I shall follow your lead.\n[00:32] >> Oh my gosh,\n[00:33] >> it's a lot of power.\n[00:34] >> I love it. I love it so much.\n[00:36] >> Harvard professor Allison Woodbrooks is\n[00:38] a behavioral scientist\n[00:39] >> who has spent two [music] decades\n[00:41] studying conversational science.\n[00:42] >> And she's revealing the communication\n[00:44] mistakes we all make. The art of\n[00:46] negotiation and how to get anyone to\n[00:48] like you.\n[00:49] >> We all get to adulthood and we feel like\n[00:51] conversation should be easy. But as a\n[00:53] scientist, when you look under the hood,\n[00:54] you realize this is why we have so many\n[00:56] awkward moments, why we say things that\n[00:58] we shouldn't, why we are boring, why we\n[01:01] get angry and hostile. And there's very\n[01:02] clear strategies to help us with all of\n[01:04] that. Like one of my biggest findings\n[01:05] was how we reframe social anxiety\n[01:07] [music] as excitement, which makes you\n[01:09] focus on opportunities rather than\n[01:11] threats. And that paper ended up being\n[01:12] featured in Inside Out, the movie. And\n[01:14] then there's small talk.\n[01:16] >> I hate small talk.\n[01:17] >> I'm going to help you reframe that\n[01:18] because it's really important. But the\n[01:19] mistake that people make is that they\n[01:21] say they're way too long and they need\n[01:22] to move up this topic pyramid.\n[01:24] >> What about in a digital age? Do we need\n[01:26] to start communicating differently?\n[01:27] >> Yeah, there's clear things that we\n[01:29] should do to make our textbased\n[01:30] communication better and we'll go\n[01:32] through all of them.\n[01:33] >> And you said you've done an interesting\n[01:34] study recently about male friendship.\n[01:37] >> Yes. And it's quite troubling.\n[01:39] >> So, how can I make more friends as a\n[01:40] man?\n[01:41] >> Yeah, let's talk about that.\n[01:45] I see messages all the time in the\n[01:47] comments section that some of you didn't\n[01:48] realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you\n[01:50] could do me a favor and double check if\n[01:52] you're a subscriber to this channel,\n[01:53] that would be tremendously appreciated.\n[01:55] It's the simple, it's the free thing\n[01:56] that anybody that watches this show\n[01:58] frequently can do to help us here to\n[02:00] keep everything going in this show in\n[02:01] the trajectory it's on. So, please do\n[02:03] double check if you've subscribed and uh\n[02:05] thank you so much because in a strange\n[02:06] way, you are you're part of our history\n[02:09] and you're on this journey with us and I\n[02:11] appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank\n[02:12] you.\n[02:14] >> [music]\n[02:20] >> Professor Allison Wood Brooks.\n[02:23] What is it that you do and why do you\n[02:26] think it matters so much to the world?\n[02:28] >> I am a professor at Harvard and I'm a\n[02:31] behavioral scientist. I study how people\n[02:35] talk to each other and how they can do\n[02:36] it better. I teach a course that I\n[02:39] created there called talk. I wrote a\n[02:42] book about it, also called Talk: The\n[02:44] Science of Conversation and the Art of\n[02:46] Being Ourselves.\n[02:47] >> And if someone's chosen to listen to\n[02:50] this conversation now, they've just\n[02:51] clicked on it and they're thinking, you\n[02:52] know, should I stay or should I should I\n[02:54] go? What promise can we give them if\n[02:57] they stay and listen to this\n[02:58] conversation that is based on the work\n[02:59] you've done in your book and all the\n[03:00] research you've done? What is it that\n[03:02] you think the average person can come\n[03:03] away with that will have a meaningful\n[03:05] impact on their day-to-day life? All of\n[03:07] life is about relationships and\n[03:11] relationships are about talking. So if\n[03:14] they can learn even one strategy that\n[03:16] helps them in their conversations, it\n[03:18] will massively improve their lives. If\n[03:21] you think of everything from work to\n[03:24] romantic relationships, friendships,\n[03:26] productivity, all of it hinges on having\n[03:30] excellent conversations.\n[03:32] >> But conversations are easy, right? Like\n[03:34] [laughter] you just talk.\n[03:35] >> We all feel that way. We all get to\n[03:37] adulthood and we feel like conversation\n[03:39] should be easy because we started\n[03:41] learning how to do it when we were one\n[03:44] one and a half years old as toddlers and\n[03:46] we practice doing it with an enormous\n[03:49] number of partners conversation partners\n[03:53] every day of our lives. So by the time\n[03:54] we become adults it feels like we should\n[03:57] be experts like we should be great at\n[03:59] it. But as a scientist, when you look\n[04:01] under the hood and you see, oh my\n[04:03] goodness, all of the complexity that's\n[04:04] happening under the hood, you realize,\n[04:07] oh, this is why we have so many awkward\n[04:09] moments, why we say things that we\n[04:11] shouldn't, why we don't say things that\n[04:12] we should, why we hurt each other, why\n[04:15] we get defensive, um why we are boring,\n[04:18] why we get angry and hostile. And there\n[04:20] are very clear strategies to help us\n[04:22] with all of that.\n[04:24] As you were saying that, I was thinking,\n[04:26] do you think there's a lot of people\n[04:27] that are going through life giving off\n[04:29] the wrong impression because they don't\n[04:31] know how to talk? Maybe they are\n[04:33] disliked. Maybe they are misunderstood\n[04:35] because they haven't mastered the\n[04:37] science of how to have a great\n[04:39] conversation. On my worst days, I worry\n[04:41] that everybody's walking around being\n[04:42] misunderstood. When you think about\n[04:45] talking, even as I'm talking right now,\n[04:48] there's no way to take the entire\n[04:50] contents of your mind and all of your\n[04:52] personality and say it out loud. And so,\n[04:55] we're always curating. We're always\n[04:57] choosing what some subset of stuff to\n[05:00] share with other people through\n[05:01] conversation. And no one is doing that\n[05:05] perfectly. And I and I fear that many\n[05:07] people are are really struggling with\n[05:09] it. If you had to pinpoint just a few\n[05:11] things that people want when they think\n[05:15] about becoming a great conversationalist\n[05:17] like what is it that we actually are\n[05:18] aiming at? Is it to be you know what is\n[05:21] that?\n[05:21] >> Yeah. Usually people want to be liked\n[05:24] even loved. Usually we want to enjoy our\n[05:27] conversations to not have them be\n[05:29] miserable. We want to feel safe and\n[05:31] protected and and not have it be\n[05:33] dreadful and timeconuming. And we want\n[05:36] to achieve professional goals. So\n[05:37] advancing and achieving and making great\n[05:40] decisions. So already the very basic\n[05:43] drives of what people are trying to\n[05:45] achieve in conversation are actually a\n[05:47] little bit more complicated than just\n[05:48] like oh we're looking for connection. Um\n[05:51] and then when you really dig into it\n[05:53] within all of the goals that people want\n[05:55] in those categories, it's like a vast\n[05:58] constellation of of motives.\n[06:01] >> I would like you to teach me how to talk\n[06:03] really really well.\n[06:04] >> I don't know if you need my help that\n[06:05] much, Stephen, but I'd love to. Even the\n[06:07] best communicators have room for\n[06:08] improvement.\n[06:09] >> No, I think I do. I think I [laughter]\n[06:10] do because I, you know, this I was\n[06:12] thinking about this last this last week\n[06:13] and all the conversations I've had, the\n[06:15] different types of conversations. I had\n[06:17] one conversation where I met someone's\n[06:20] family for the first time who works with\n[06:22] me. And it was, you know, it was a\n[06:24] little bit nerve-wracking because\n[06:26] >> that contact, you know, people have have\n[06:28] these moments where they meet the\n[06:29] in-laws or whatever or they meet\n[06:31] >> um for me it's often meeting someone who\n[06:32] works with me's family, I find quite\n[06:33] nerve-wracking because they're like, I\n[06:35] think they're kind of probably judging\n[06:36] me. I've also had difficult business\n[06:37] conversations\n[06:38] >> because they are judging you.\n[06:39] >> Yeah, they are judging [laughter] me and\n[06:40] I can feel it. And as I go towards those\n[06:42] conversations, I'm like, \"Oh my god.\"\n[06:44] And then I end up just like freezing or\n[06:45] being a little bit paralyzed. And you'd\n[06:47] think as someone like me who does this\n[06:49] for a living living finds conversations\n[06:50] easy. I absolutely do not. you I I\n[06:52] actually the more uh you know I talk to\n[06:56] very high level seuite um very\n[06:59] successful people and in fact the higher\n[07:02] and more successful people are the more\n[07:03] likely they are to be aware that this is\n[07:07] really important and that they have room\n[07:10] for improvement. It's almost like you're\n[07:11] aware that this skill is probably what\n[07:14] helped you get where you are and\n[07:16] therefore you want to get even better at\n[07:18] it and you're keenly aware of when you\n[07:20] have awkward moments or make mistakes or\n[07:22] missteps and you're like I would really\n[07:24] like to get that out of my life please.\n[07:26] >> Amen. I like ruminate on an awkward\n[07:28] encounter I had like two and a half\n[07:29] weeks ago. I was like, I should have\n[07:31] just da da d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d\n[07:31] d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d\n[07:31] d d d d d but actually in reading some\n[07:32] of your work I thought about what I\n[07:34] could have done and we'll get to this\n[07:35] this idea of preparing for those moments\n[07:38] which I typically don't because I assume\n[07:40] I should be a natural.\n[07:41] >> Can I ask you as you were talking about\n[07:42] these different examples of things that\n[07:44] you're ruminating about? Um, do you feel\n[07:47] like you have a a a weakness or like a a\n[07:52] recurring thing that you suspect you\n[07:54] need to get better at? I think one of\n[07:56] them is I am a bit of an introvert in my\n[07:58] sort of self-classification and as\n[08:01] people know who I am more in the world,\n[08:03] I think I've become more introverted.\n[08:06] >> So, and sometimes that can be perceived\n[08:08] in the wrong way. So, my like happy\n[08:10] state is kind of being alone or around\n[08:12] people that I'm extremely familiar with.\n[08:13] >> If I leave the house and I go say to a\n[08:15] gym or something,\n[08:16] >> I have a little bit of paranoia.\n[08:18] >> Yeah.\n[08:18] >> So, I'm always kind of on edge, which\n[08:20] means that this kind of shuts me down\n[08:22] more. So when I do have conversations, I\n[08:23] can sometimes feel appear to be a bit\n[08:25] more shut down and I don't want to carry\n[08:26] that into moments where I need to be a\n[08:28] bit more open. And then I would say\n[08:32] generally I just like hate small talk.\n[08:34] >> Yeah, you're not alone there.\n[08:36] >> And [laughter] I just say it's like a\n[08:37] point. This is why I think I podcast\n[08:38] because you can just skip straight into\n[08:39] the deep stuff and I can ask people\n[08:40] about their trauma. Like\n[08:41] >> you can do that in normal conversations\n[08:44] too actually. Do you find that you get\n[08:46] stuck in small talk?\n[08:47] >> Yes,\n[08:48] >> a good bit.\n[08:48] >> I just try and avoid it. So I I've got\n[08:50] this funny story. one of the most that\n[08:52] the most prestigious people on planet\n[08:53] earth invited me to come to a thing and\n[08:55] I said no because there would be a\n[08:57] hundred other people there and I just\n[08:58] didn't want to be in a room for four\n[08:59] hours with a bunch of other people like\n[09:01] it just for me it's so exhausting.\n[09:03] >> Yeah.\n[09:03] >> And if I told you that what this context\n[09:05] was you'd burst out laughing [laughter]\n[09:07] and my team were like you go to that\n[09:09] [ __ ] YOU GO\n[09:11] >> AND YOU enjoy it\n[09:12] >> and I'm like no I'm not going there's\n[09:14] [laughter] too many people there. But\n[09:15] that's that's kind of what I'm like. I\n[09:17] love this environment, but I hate small\n[09:18] talk. And I hate\n[09:19] >> I don't know if that's a weakness as\n[09:21] much as it is you learning your\n[09:22] preferences.\n[09:23] >> I think it's okay. Uh maybe we'll get\n[09:26] there, but large groups are very\n[09:28] stressful. Group conversation and\n[09:30] figuring out the structure of like who\n[09:32] should be talking to whom when and about\n[09:34] what is very overwhelming for the human\n[09:36] mind. um it's quite different than one\n[09:39] on intimate one-on-one conversation\n[09:41] which is much more within your control\n[09:42] and it's much clearer what the purpose\n[09:45] is. Um so we should think about it maybe\n[09:49] not a we can reframe it and it's not a\n[09:51] weakness but thinking about your social\n[09:53] portfolio. Who are you talking to? Is it\n[09:56] the right people and are is it in the\n[09:58] right arrangements in the right group\n[10:00] size? So, what we're doing right now\n[10:01] one-on-one is a categorically different\n[10:04] task than going to a party with a\n[10:06] hundred people. So, I'm going to help\n[10:08] you reframe that later on.\n[10:09] [clears throat]\n[10:10] >> Why did you choose to do this? All the\n[10:12] things you could have done with your\n[10:13] life.\n[10:13] >> Yeah, it's Isn't life so fascinating? I\n[10:16] often think about the paths not taken.\n[10:18] Um, but I'm very happy to be on this\n[10:20] path. Um, I grew up in upstate New York\n[10:23] on a small lake in a small town. I was a\n[10:26] late girl, just gorgeous place. And I\n[10:29] love playing sports, team sports in\n[10:32] particular. I love female friendship\n[10:35] from an early age. And probably most\n[10:37] formatively, I'm an identical twin. And\n[10:41] all of the things I just described, I\n[10:44] think, are either\n[10:46] indicators of how much I love\n[10:48] conversation or formed my love of\n[10:50] conversation. But either way, I I\n[10:52] arrived at college deeply interested in\n[10:55] understanding humans and their behavior.\n[10:59] And by the time I got to Harvard, I\n[11:01] realized, wow, there are whole fields\n[11:03] like social psychology and communication\n[11:05] that are purportedly about\n[11:07] communication, but nobody's bothered to\n[11:09] actually transcribe real conversations\n[11:12] and study them at very large scale. And\n[11:14] so that's what I've been up to for the\n[11:16] last 15 years.\n[11:17] >> How has being an identical twin been\n[11:19] formative in this regard? M. So, my\n[11:21] twin's name is Sarah. Um, being an\n[11:24] identical twin, I'm there are many\n[11:26] things that are similar to being a close\n[11:27] sibling, I'm sure. But an identical\n[11:29] twin, it's like you have another version\n[11:31] of you in the world. And we share a\n[11:34] bedroom. We were on the same sports\n[11:35] teams. We played in band together. And\n[11:38] so, it's sort of like watching a version\n[11:40] of yourself up close. And I got to see\n[11:44] how she failed and thought, \"Oh, well,\n[11:48] I'm I'm going to avoid that.\" and I\n[11:50] would see how she succeeds. She hits a\n[11:52] an amazing joke. She answers answers an\n[11:54] amazing question. I know that I'm able\n[11:56] to do that because we have the same DNA,\n[11:58] the same abilities. In a sort of\n[12:00] subconscious way, I think I've just been\n[12:02] chasing trying to help other people find\n[12:05] that in their relationships, uh, in\n[12:07] their friendships, in their romantic\n[12:09] relationships, in their work\n[12:10] collaborations, because I've gotten to\n[12:13] see how amazing that can be for two\n[12:15] human beings, how close you can be and\n[12:17] how much you can actually understand\n[12:18] each other when you communicate well.\n[12:21] >> And what research have you done? Like,\n[12:23] what are the reference points you're\n[12:24] pulling on? Do you do your own research?\n[12:26] >> So much. and give me a flavor of the the\n[12:29] >> Too much probably. I uh it's almost like\n[12:31] I'm a recovering academic. I've been\n[12:33] working in academia doing behavioral\n[12:35] science research for 20 years. I know I\n[12:37] look impossibly young. Um, I started in\n[12:40] graduate school studying emotions,\n[12:43] especially anxiety and and not the kind\n[12:45] of anxiety that requires medication or\n[12:48] therapy necessarily, but the types of\n[12:50] social anxiety that people feel\n[12:52] constantly all day long. And figuring\n[12:55] out, okay, how does it affect different\n[12:56] behaviors like how we negotiate or how\n[12:59] we take advice from each other or how we\n[13:02] perform when we're public speaking? Uh,\n[13:04] these types of things. and then figuring\n[13:06] out strategies and tips to help people\n[13:09] manage that anxiety more effectively.\n[13:12] And one of my biggest findings was how\n[13:13] we reframe anxiety as excitement. Uh\n[13:17] it's a very easy flip to move from it's\n[13:20] essentially they're the same emotion\n[13:21] because they're both high arousal, high\n[13:23] energy, high cortisol, a stress hormone,\n[13:26] um high heart rate, uh sweaty palms. You\n[13:28] just change how you think about it in\n[13:29] your mind. So literally saying things\n[13:31] out loud like I'm excited change how\n[13:35] your appraisal of it. So you actually\n[13:36] experience excitement. It helps you\n[13:38] perform a lot better in a lot of\n[13:39] different ways.\n[13:40] >> So you did a study in 2011 was it?\n[13:43] >> Yes. Yes.\n[13:43] >> The nervous Nelly negotiation study.\n[13:45] >> So that one was about negotiation\n[13:47] specifically the um this excitement\n[13:50] reappraisal. The paper's called get\n[13:51] excited. And that paper actually ended\n[13:54] up being featured in uh Inside Out the\n[13:56] movie.\n[13:57] >> Oh wow.\n[13:57] >> Yeah. There's a great scene where the\n[13:59] main character is about to have a panic\n[14:00] attack and Joy sneaks into the little\n[14:04] cubicle farm of minions and says, \"Stop\n[14:06] drawing all of these projections about\n[14:07] how things are going to go badly and\n[14:09] instead draw how things could go well.\"\n[14:12] Which is so great. And I was sitting in\n[14:13] the movie theater with my kids and my\n[14:15] husband kind of looked down the way and\n[14:16] he was like, \"Is that your thing?\" And I\n[14:18] was like, \"Yeah, yeah, [laughter] yeah,\n[14:19] it's my thing.\"\n[14:20] >> So, what what did that study show? of\n[14:22] those two studies, the the nervous Nelly\n[14:23] one, but also the the one of excitement.\n[14:25] >> When [clears throat] we feel anxious, as\n[14:27] most people do in negotiations because\n[14:29] it's an intense environment filled with\n[14:32] uncertainty and a lack of control, which\n[14:34] is the recipe for anxiety, we tend we\n[14:36] want to escape. We either want to\n[14:38] relieve that feeling by making\n[14:40] concessions or get out of there, right?\n[14:42] Just exit the interaction. That was the\n[14:45] main finding of the nervous Nelly\n[14:46] anxiety and negotiation paper. The\n[14:49] reframing anxiety as excitement paper is\n[14:52] lots of different ways to convince\n[14:54] yourself that you're feeling excited\n[14:56] just by saying I'm excited out loud. And\n[14:58] in doing so, that makes you focus on\n[15:00] opportunities rather than threats, how\n[15:02] things could go well rather than poorly.\n[15:04] And it has incredible downstream\n[15:06] consequences. Helps you sing better,\n[15:08] helps you do public speaking better, it\n[15:10] helps you collaborate more effectively.\n[15:12] Um, so it's just a very it's a very\n[15:14] powerful intervention.\n[15:14] >> And what was the sort of mechanics of\n[15:16] the study? So, we would have bring\n[15:18] people in. You tell them, \"Hey, Stephen,\n[15:21] you're going to be singing karaoke in\n[15:22] front of an audience. People start to\n[15:25] feel quite nervous about this\n[15:26] naturally.\"\n[15:28] Then, right before they're going to get\n[15:30] up and sing this song, we say, \"Okay, an\n[15:33] experimenttor is going to ask you how\n[15:34] you're feeling. Some of you, we want you\n[15:36] to say you're feeling excited, and some\n[15:38] of you, we want you to say you're\n[15:40] feeling anxious.\" And that alone, when I\n[15:42] say, \"Stephen, how are you feeling right\n[15:43] now?\" and you say\n[15:46] >> anxious.\n[15:46] >> Great. Okay, let's go sing the song. You\n[15:49] go. People who said I'm anxious sing\n[15:52] worse compared to people who say I'm\n[15:54] excited. They get out there. They're\n[15:56] more in tempo, more on pitch. They have\n[15:58] better rhythm. And we measure it with a\n[16:01] software when they're actually singing\n[16:03] in front of the experimenters.\n[16:04] >> Just by me saying I am excited.\n[16:06] >> Yeah.\n[16:07] >> So the other day when I met my team\n[16:09] members family, I I should have been\n[16:11] saying to myself, I'm so excited to meet\n[16:13] them. among other things. So, so this\n[16:16] and this is important. It doesn't always\n[16:18] work, right? If you're terrified\n[16:21] >> and it's really something dreadful, like\n[16:24] you're terrified that your mother's\n[16:25] going to die and turns out it's going to\n[16:27] be hard to get excited about that if she\n[16:29] has a terminal illness. But on the\n[16:31] margin, if you're sort of torn between\n[16:33] feeling nervous or excited in your mind,\n[16:36] if you can really convince yourself that\n[16:38] you actually are excited and that things\n[16:40] could go well, I'm going to crush this\n[16:41] exam. I'm gonna I'm gonna tear it up on\n[16:44] the basketball court. That flip, if\n[16:46] repeated enough, actually becomes more\n[16:48] likely to come true and certainly before\n[16:51] a high stakes conversation like meeting\n[16:53] your colleagues family.\n[16:54] >> So interesting. I I really I have this\n[16:56] behind the scenes channel um called\n[16:57] Behind the Diary on YouTube and uh the\n[16:59] other day when I did Jimmy Fallon\n[17:01] because it's kind of outside of my\n[17:02] wheelhouse to go on like late night TV\n[17:04] in America and like seven minutes to be\n[17:06] funny or whatever. So I was [ __ ]\n[17:07] myself cuz I'm a very serious guy.\n[17:09] [laughter]\n[17:10] So before I went out, there's a video of\n[17:12] me and I said to my team, what I said to\n[17:14] myself before the little curtain opened\n[17:16] was, \"This is going to be amazing. Can't\n[17:18] wait. You've you've like prepared for\n[17:20] this.\" Then I said all this nonsense in\n[17:22] my head thinking that it was nonsense\n[17:23] and I walked out. I had the best time of\n[17:25] my life. It was it went so great.\n[17:26] >> Great.\n[17:27] >> And I I made a video about that how, you\n[17:29] know, I'm not one to believe in things\n[17:31] that without like rigor and evidence and\n[17:33] I didn't have it.\n[17:35] >> Now you do.\n[17:36] >> Now I do. [laughter] Now we have a study\n[17:38] that proves that it's not.\n[17:39] >> This one is interesting. I think this\n[17:40] was the beginning of my scientific\n[17:42] journey realizing that the way we talk\n[17:45] to other people and the way we talk to\n[17:47] ourselves especially in a repeated sense\n[17:49] if you think about okay you did that\n[17:51] before Jimmy Fallon now what if you do\n[17:53] it before the next time you meet a\n[17:54] colleague's family now what if you do it\n[17:56] before you interview Bill Gates before\n[17:58] you do it right if you then get in the\n[18:00] habit of telling yourself you're excited\n[18:02] and that becomes effective for you it's\n[18:05] incredibly meaningful in accumulation\n[18:07] over time right so just focusing on one\n[18:09] time yes it's helpful but if you can\n[18:12] make it habitual it has this sort of\n[18:13] upward spiral effect on people it was\n[18:16] the beginning of my scientific journey\n[18:18] thinking oh well if we can study one\n[18:20] phrase like get excited or I'm excited\n[18:23] what if we start studying the cascading\n[18:25] unfolding ways that people talk to each\n[18:27] other and not just one line but like\n[18:29] every turn of a conversation no one had\n[18:32] done that before\n[18:33] >> and this negotiation study you did what\n[18:35] was the mechanism for that\n[18:36] >> yeah that was a more class so the the\n[18:39] literature. People have been studying\n[18:40] negotiations for decades now. And\n[18:43] there's a really great negotiation\n[18:45] course at almost every business school\n[18:47] and law school that's based in all of\n[18:49] this rigorous work. What had not been\n[18:51] studied on in terms of negotiating are\n[18:53] people's emotions. It was a it was about\n[18:55] 15 years ago that people including\n[18:57] scholars came to the point where we were\n[18:59] like, \"Oh, people's feelings matter.\"\n[19:01] When they feel nervous or when they feel\n[19:02] angry, that's actually important\n[19:04] distinction. how you feel on the inside\n[19:06] versus what you're expressing to your\n[19:08] counterpart. So in this paper, what we\n[19:10] found is as a base rate, most people\n[19:12] feel anxious before and during a\n[19:14] negotiation because it is an intense\n[19:16] environment. It's probably one of the\n[19:19] greatest benefits of taking a\n[19:20] negotiation course is that you just get\n[19:22] reps and so you get more comfortable\n[19:24] with the process of doing it. That might\n[19:26] be the biggest takeaway from doing a\n[19:28] training course like that. And so in\n[19:30] this paper, we had that sort of base\n[19:32] rate. Look, everybody's feeling anxious.\n[19:33] Um, and then what are the downstream\n[19:36] consequences of feeling anxious? And\n[19:38] what we find people, we had people doing\n[19:40] negotiations, playing these negotiation\n[19:42] games. What we find is that people are\n[19:44] much more likely to sort of leave\n[19:46] prematurely or make more concessions to\n[19:49] relieve the feelings of anxiety,\n[19:51] >> make bad offers.\n[19:52] >> Yeah. Or it depends on your goals,\n[19:55] right? If you if your goal is to claim a\n[19:58] lot of value, then making concessions\n[19:59] and giving money away is not going to\n[20:01] help you with that. So, if I'm asking my\n[20:03] boss for a pay rise, for example, and I\n[20:05] and I'm very very nervous, I'm much more\n[20:07] likely to um lower my expectations,\n[20:11] accept a bad offer, and leave the\n[20:14] situation prematurely.\n[20:15] >> Absolutely.\n[20:16] >> So, what do I do about that?\n[20:17] >> Oh, so many things. If we're talking\n[20:19] about asking for a raise, um what you\n[20:22] want is to go in there with as much sort\n[20:24] of personal power as you can, one way to\n[20:27] do that is to get another job offer\n[20:29] somewhere else first. So, we talk about\n[20:32] this as the best alternative to a\n[20:34] negotiated agreement, a BATNA. You want\n[20:36] to strengthen your BATNA. So, if your\n[20:38] boss says, \"No, I'm not giving you a\n[20:40] raise.\" You can legitimately say, \"I'm\n[20:43] going to go take this other job offer\n[20:44] cuz I just got a better offer from the\n[20:46] guy down the street.\"\n[20:47] >> What if you don't want to take the the\n[20:50] other offer?\n[20:51] >> Then you need to be honest with yourself\n[20:52] about how much power you have in the\n[20:54] negotiation. You also probably a lot of\n[20:57] people make the mistake of going in sort\n[20:58] of hands on hips like I deserve more\n[21:00] money. There are lots of questions that\n[21:02] you should ask first to know am I\n[21:04] negotiating with the right person? Does\n[21:07] my company have the funds to actually\n[21:09] give me more money? Why? What? How can I\n[21:12] justify this in a way that's compelling\n[21:14] to them? Right? It's it's not up to you.\n[21:17] It's that they they need to want to keep\n[21:19] you and to feel like you are being\n[21:22] fairly and generously rewarded and all\n[21:26] of that requires asking a lot of\n[21:27] questions before you go in and start\n[21:29] making demands.\n[21:30] >> In that context, how would you try and\n[21:32] persuade me if you work for me? So, what\n[21:35] would you say? Because I do think, you\n[21:36] know, it's very easy to get someone's\n[21:38] backup when you walk in and ask them for\n[21:39] money. Yeah.\n[21:40] >> If you do it\n[21:41] >> 100%. I\n[21:44] it's hard for me to answer this because\n[21:47] um maybe this is sort of my personal\n[21:49] values. It's almost like I'm taking off\n[21:50] my expert hat for a moment. I think the\n[21:53] best way to get a raise is to be\n[21:55] awesome.\n[21:57] Do things that are valuable\n[22:00] and your company is going to give you\n[22:01] more money without even having to ask\n[22:04] for it. So in my heart, this question of\n[22:07] how do we have a conversation where I\n[22:09] ask for more money? It's almost like I I\n[22:11] would hope that you don't even get to\n[22:13] that point. If you are truly making\n[22:15] yourself almost irreplaceable and\n[22:18] incredibly valuable, your boss is going\n[22:21] to be coming to you and saying, \"I have\n[22:22] to keep you around. You're amazing.\n[22:24] You're so incredible.\" That's a much\n[22:26] easier conversation to have than walking\n[22:27] in and saying, \"I'm I'm it's not fair. I\n[22:30] don't make enough.\"\n[22:31] >> I do think that holds to be true. I\n[22:33] think that generally if people's first\n[22:34] priority is what they want, then they\n[22:38] often don't tend to get what they want.\n[22:39] But people who have the priority, their\n[22:41] first priority is what I can give tend\n[22:43] to get what they want.\n[22:44] >> That's right. It's so um it's a bit of a\n[22:48] sort of like a mindset shift. If you\n[22:51] prioritize other people's needs, if\n[22:53] you're thinking about what your boss\n[22:55] finds valuable, what the organization\n[22:57] finds valuable, and you rise to meet\n[23:00] those needs, you make yourself valuable,\n[23:02] which is going to come back to you. Um\n[23:05] hopefully that's what that's the hope.\n[23:07] And I think often that is the case.\n[23:09] Almost always that is the case in the\n[23:11] talk framework and we'll get there. The\n[23:12] K is for kindness. And it's not kindness\n[23:14] in the sense of like altruism because\n[23:17] I'm going to help my boss and do\n[23:18] everything he wants because I care so\n[23:21] deeply. That can be part of it. But also\n[23:23] it's this sort of loop of like well if\n[23:25] you give him everything every if you\n[23:27] give the organization what it needs\n[23:28] that's going to come back to you. You\n[23:30] will actually become valuable and get\n[23:32] what you want as well. That's how\n[23:34] relationships work. Usually when I\n[23:36] interview people, I lead the way. Today,\n[23:38] I'm going to follow, okay? [laughter]\n[23:40] Because you know the outcome that me and\n[23:42] the audience want to get to. So, I have\n[23:45] all this stuff here.\n[23:46] >> I love it. Props.\n[23:47] >> I have all these props.\n[23:48] >> Fabulous.\n[23:49] >> I have these blocks that for anyone that\n[23:51] can't see the conversation, say T A L K\n[23:54] on them. Talk.\n[23:54] >> Fabulous.\n[23:55] >> And you tell me the best place to start.\n[23:57] You know the outcome. You know where I\n[23:58] want to get to. I want to be the best\n[24:00] conversationalist, the best talker, the\n[24:01] most persuasive, influential, likable\n[24:06] talker in the world. Um, so I shall\n[24:08] follow your lead.\n[24:09] >> Oh my gosh,\n[24:10] >> it's a lot of power.\n[24:11] >> I love it. I love it so much. Um, let's\n[24:14] start with this. Um, I want you to think\n[24:17] of a conversation that you had recently.\n[24:21] It has to be more than 5 minutes long.\n[24:24] >> More than five? Yes, I can think of one\n[24:25] immediately. It was a conversation I had\n[24:27] with my girlfriend where I just wanted\n[24:28] her to know that I accept the fact that\n[24:30] I [ __ ] up. Like I I I accept the fact\n[24:32] that I should have been more present in\n[24:34] a particular moment and I wasn't. And I\n[24:36] just wanted to like\n[24:38] >> own it.\n[24:39] >> Own it\n[24:39] >> and and convey that to her\n[24:41] >> and convey that I'm sorry and I get it.\n[24:42] >> Yeah.\n[24:43] >> And this is not one where I'm going to\n[24:45] try and justify my whatever. No,\n[24:47] actually\n[24:48] objectively I should have been more\n[24:50] attentive and present. Y\n[24:52] >> I just wanted her to know that.\n[24:53] >> Yep. So you sort of have an admission of\n[24:55] blameworthiness.\n[24:57] Uh why why did you want to do that?\n[25:00] >> Because I felt that she was right and I\n[25:02] regretted my my behavior.\n[25:04] >> Yeah.\n[25:05] >> So sometimes I don't feel like she's\n[25:07] right. Sometimes I'm here to, you know,\n[25:10] respond. In this particular scenario, I\n[25:11] thought, you know, actually on balance,\n[25:13] I should have been more present. This\n[25:15] was an important time for her and in\n[25:18] hindsight,\n[25:21] that's not how I wish I had behaved.\n[25:22] >> Okay. How did you want her to feel\n[25:25] during and at the end of this\n[25:27] conversation?\n[25:30] >> Understood.\n[25:32] >> And\n[25:34] you really unders that was really it.\n[25:36] It's like I wanted her to feel\n[25:37] understood and\n[25:41] >> I guess like connected to me. But it's\n[25:43] more it's really more I just wanted her\n[25:44] to not worry that I didn't understand so\n[25:48] she didn't have to say it again. Like I\n[25:49] just wanted her to know that I I get it.\n[25:51] >> Mhm.\n[25:52] >> Mhm. Mh.\n[25:52] >> And that in future I wish I behave\n[25:54] differently.\n[25:54] >> How did you want to feel during and\n[25:58] after this conversation?\n[25:59] >> I guess I wanted to offload the guilt.\n[26:01] >> Uhhuh. [laughter]\n[26:02] Aha. Good. Good.\n[26:04] >> Because I felt bad. I felt like no\n[26:05] actually.\n[26:05] >> And it was weighing on your conscience.\n[26:07] You were like, I got to I I got to say\n[26:08] that. I got to own this because it's\n[26:09] making me feel like a [ __ ]\n[26:11] >> Yeah.\n[26:11] >> Okay. Fabulous. Okay.\n[26:15] When we look back on our conversations\n[26:16] and try and describe what our goals\n[26:18] were, very quickly you start to realize\n[26:21] that our goals are very complicated that\n[26:23] we want a lot of things. I'm also\n[26:25] guessing there may have been a time\n[26:26] component. Can you talk a little bit\n[26:27] about that? Like how much time did you\n[26:29] have to achieve these goals?\n[26:32] >> I mean, I never seem to have enough\n[26:34] time. So, it was like it was [laughter]\n[26:36] Yeah. So, I I I had about probably about\n[26:39] 20 minutes.\n[26:40] >> Great. Hey, that's pretty good.\n[26:42] >> I wish I had 20 minutes with my husband.\n[26:44] Okay. Um, so I have a framework that\n[26:48] helps us think about conversational\n[26:50] goals and I call it the conversational\n[26:53] compass. Okay. And like a compass that\n[26:56] you might use to find your way out of\n[26:57] the desert or the forest. The compass\n[27:01] helps you decide which way not to walk\n[27:03] but to talk. Okay. So the xaxis\n[27:08] >> I'll put this on the screen for anyone\n[27:09] that's uh can see the video.\n[27:10] >> Great. Um, the X-axis, which runs\n[27:13] horizontally, is about your\n[27:15] relationship.\n[27:15] >> Also, I'll link it below.\n[27:17] >> So, this relational axis, high\n[27:18] relational goals are things that you\n[27:20] care about that are serving the other\n[27:22] person or your relationship. This\n[27:24] conversation sounded very high\n[27:26] relational. You're truly like, I just\n[27:29] really want her to know that I feel like\n[27:31] a [ __ ] and that I'm owning it and\n[27:33] like I care and I maybe won't do it\n[27:36] again. Something like that. Low\n[27:38] relational goals are things we care\n[27:40] about that serve us. So in this case you\n[27:42] said something like I want to offload\n[27:43] get rid of my guilt. I wasn't I was\n[27:45] feeling bad. [snorts] The why access is\n[27:48] about information exchange. High\n[27:50] informationational goals are hinge on\n[27:53] exchanging accurate information. It's\n[27:55] sort of the reason human beings learn\n[27:58] develop the ability to communicate at\n[27:59] all right way back when is to take\n[28:02] what's in my brain communicate it to you\n[28:03] accurately. But we care about tons of\n[28:06] stuff that is lowformational. So it's\n[28:08] not about exchanging information and\n[28:09] sometimes it's about concealing it. In\n[28:12] this case, you had a highformational\n[28:14] goal. You wanted to sort of persuade her\n[28:16] or prove to her that you're a good guy\n[28:19] and that she should stay with you\n[28:20] essentially, trust you. But you also had\n[28:23] lowformational goals like you didn't\n[28:25] want it to be emotionally unpleasant to\n[28:27] have this conversation. You also had\n[28:29] lowformational goals like a time\n[28:31] constraint. You needed to protect your\n[28:32] time and her time. uh and and so we're\n[28:35] always limited by time and cognitive\n[28:38] resources.\n[28:39] So the point of this is to help us plot\n[28:42] all of those goals in a logical way. Uh\n[28:46] each quadrant is good. We live in all\n[28:49] four quadrants. We're not trying to get\n[28:50] to one or another. It's just to help us\n[28:53] describe all of the many things that we\n[28:55] actually care about almost to validate\n[28:58] them and say, \"Listen, it's legit that\n[29:00] you wanted to relieve your guilt. super\n[29:02] admirable that you wanted to signal to\n[29:04] her that like you're owning this\n[29:05] mistake. It's legit that you have time\n[29:08] constraints. It's legit that you don't\n[29:10] want your conversations to be\n[29:11] unpleasant. So each of the quadrants get\n[29:13] gets a positive name. Highformational,\n[29:15] high relational is about connection.\n[29:17] Okay. Often you'll hear communications\n[29:20] uh experts just talk about connection\n[29:22] which is um too narrow. It's not the\n[29:25] only thing that we care about down here.\n[29:27] Low informational, high relational is\n[29:30] about savoring.\n[29:31] >> What does informational mean\n[29:33] >> in this context?\n[29:33] >> Like how much uh accurate information\n[29:36] you are trying to you need to exchange\n[29:40] with each other. If we just sat here\n[29:42] kind of quietly and I hummed a song\n[29:45] because we that and I said something\n[29:48] like I love your shirt. We're not\n[29:50] exchanging a lot of information but we\n[29:52] might be having a very lovely\n[29:54] interaction with each other. So not\n[29:56] every conversation is about high\n[29:58] information exchange though many people\n[30:01] think that it is. You know these people\n[30:04] they're very transactional. They feel\n[30:06] like a conversation is where you just\n[30:08] say things you know at other people and\n[30:10] that they're going to say things they\n[30:12] know back at you. That's a big mistake.\n[30:15] >> So having fun I can see is in the bottom\n[30:17] right corner.\n[30:17] >> Having fun. Yes.\n[30:18] >> Because it's not about huge information\n[30:19] exchange but it is about connections.\n[30:22] Okay.\n[30:23] >> Oh and it's really important. Many of my\n[30:24] students at Harvard almost forget about\n[30:26] this quadrant. They're like, \"If we're\n[30:28] not persuading and making decisions,\n[30:29] we're not living right. Like, this is\n[30:32] really important, especially over time.\n[30:34] If we're not enjoying being with each\n[30:36] other, I'm not going to look forward to\n[30:38] talking to you again.\" That's true at\n[30:40] work and outside of work. Lower left is\n[30:43] essentially discernment. We call it\n[30:45] protection. It's protecting your time,\n[30:46] protecting your reputation, protecting\n[30:48] information. So, concealing, keeping\n[30:51] secrets, moving quickly. We can't sit\n[30:54] here for hours and hours and hours. Um,\n[30:56] and then protecting your reputation.\n[30:57] Like you care about making a positive\n[30:59] impression on other people. I want you\n[31:01] to see me as smart and warm and calm and\n[31:06] trustworthy. These are self-serving, low\n[31:08] relational or low informational goals.\n[31:11] And then we get up to upper left, which\n[31:12] is low relational, they're self-s\n[31:14] serving, high informational. This is a\n[31:16] lot of work rellated goal, persuasion,\n[31:18] making decisions, brainstorming, etc. So\n[31:21] if I want to be liked and have great\n[31:24] relationships, I need to be on the right\n[31:25] side of this. Is that accurate?\n[31:27] >> So what happens if someone who trusts\n[31:30] you and loves you tells you something in\n[31:32] confidence and then you go tell\n[31:35] everybody else?\n[31:37] >> You lose trust.\n[31:38] >> Yeah. So it's not that you can only live\n[31:41] on this side of the compass because\n[31:43] discernment matters\n[31:45] >> for relationships. Okay. Right. So, and\n[31:48] here you are going to be in a\n[31:50] relationship where hopefully you're\n[31:52] going to be like brainstorming things\n[31:53] together, making decisions together.\n[31:55] Even with a friend, you're like, \"Oh,\n[31:57] where should we go to dinner tonight?\"\n[31:58] You need to make that coordinate that\n[32:00] choice well together. So, I think one\n[32:03] aspiration is to try and be over on the\n[32:05] right side as much as you can. And in\n[32:07] fact, having the mindset of pushing\n[32:09] yourself to try and think about your\n[32:12] goals that are more pro-social more\n[32:14] often is a virtuous goal. But like\n[32:16] listen, we all have actual needs. So\n[32:19] like you can't only live on the right\n[32:21] side of the compass. It's about moving\n[32:24] around in a way that is savvy and and\n[32:27] actually serves what you care about.\n[32:31] >> Yeah.\n[32:31] >> Gotcha.\n[32:32] >> Do you have a sense of where your goals\n[32:34] from that conversation that you\n[32:35] described would be?\n[32:36] >> Apologize.\n[32:38] >> Which is high relational\n[32:40] and not very high on informational cuz I\n[32:42] didn't have a bunch I didn't have a lot\n[32:43] to say. It was just very simply about\n[32:46] letting her know that I was sorry. And\n[32:47] it wasn't I didn't have a big\n[32:48] explanation or a bunch of excuses or\n[32:51] justifications. It was just listen, I\n[32:53] [ __ ] up. Yeah, I get it.\n[32:54] >> Can we talk about apologies for a sec?\n[32:55] >> Sure.\n[32:56] >> I love that you chose this as your\n[32:58] example because and the way you're\n[33:01] describing it. I love how you're saying\n[33:03] um I didn't go into a huge explanation\n[33:05] of why I did it or anything. More people\n[33:08] should apologize that way. A lot of\n[33:09] people their instinct when they're\n[33:11] apologizing is to revisit the problem\n[33:13] and sort of make excuses or explain why\n[33:16] they m did the thing wrong. It's not\n[33:19] effective. Um what is more effective is\n[33:22] what you're describing. Taking ownership\n[33:24] and saying, \"Look, I I just messed up\n[33:26] and I'm so sorry and I feel awful about\n[33:28] it.\" And the most effective component of\n[33:31] an apology is actually making a promise\n[33:33] to change. If you say to your\n[33:35] girlfriend, \"I realize I messed up here.\n[33:38] I'm not going to do it again. Here's how\n[33:40] I'm going to be different in the future.\n[33:41] Like a concrete plan. It's so compelling\n[33:44] to hear that you've thought about that\n[33:47] and that and then it's measurable\n[33:48] because she can see in the future. Do do\n[33:50] you actually live up to that promise? Do\n[33:53] you follow through on this promise to\n[33:54] never do make the mistake again?\n[33:56] >> Is there a point where you can apologize\n[33:58] too much?\n[33:59] >> We studied this. I ran some studies on\n[34:01] this. Um, we started by looking at um,\n[34:05] frequency of apologies made during\n[34:07] normal conversations. It's quite rare\n[34:09] for someone to over apologize, but it\n[34:12] does seem like within one conversation,\n[34:13] if you apologize more than twice, it\n[34:16] starts to be more of a reminder of the\n[34:18] bad thing that happened. Like you just\n[34:21] keep revisiting it and it brings you\n[34:22] back to the negativity rather than\n[34:24] moving forward.\n[34:27] We also studied apologies in a really\n[34:29] large data set of parole hearings like\n[34:31] among people who had committed really\n[34:33] serious crimes and we looked at the\n[34:36] types of apologies that they made in\n[34:37] their par during their parole hearings.\n[34:40] And there it seems like you actually\n[34:41] can't overapologize like more is better.\n[34:45] And again, the most effective component\n[34:47] is making a promise to change in the\n[34:49] future. Um I'm going to go I'm when I\n[34:51] get out I'm going to be an AA. I'm going\n[34:53] to live live with my grandmother. here's\n[34:55] the job I'm going to do, whatever the\n[34:57] plan is. Um, you're actually more likely\n[34:59] to get out of jail.\n[35:01] >> And going into those difficult\n[35:03] conversations, is there anything one\n[35:05] needs to do to prepare?\n[35:07] >> Because we our lives are full of\n[35:08] difficult conversations and actually\n[35:09] it's the avoidance of them that ends up\n[35:10] messing up our lives the most. So when\n[35:12] you think about difficult conversations\n[35:14] that we all have to have or with\n[35:15] difficult people is do I have to prepare\n[35:18] for that?\n[35:18] >> So this is very natural. Almost every\n[35:20] person that you hear talk about\n[35:21] communication tends to focus on\n[35:23] difficult conversations. I'm going to\n[35:26] suggest to you that that is a very\n[35:27] narrow view of the conversational world\n[35:30] actually. And in fact, thinking about\n[35:32] difficult conversations is a little bit\n[35:35] of a misnomer. It's not like there are\n[35:38] some conversations that are difficult\n[35:39] and some that are easy.\n[35:41] >> It's that in every conversation there\n[35:43] can be moments of difference where we\n[35:46] use different language to mean the same\n[35:48] thing. where we have an in congruence in\n[35:50] our emotions, where we have a difference\n[35:52] in motives. I want to give you advice,\n[35:54] but you don't want to take it. Or\n[35:56] something dips down to a difference in\n[35:58] our identities. I'm American and you're\n[36:00] a Brit. So, anytime you encounter these\n[36:04] little fleeting moments of difference in\n[36:06] all of these different ways, and maybe\n[36:08] there was an image here. Let me see. No,\n[36:09] it's not here. Um, it looks like layers.\n[36:11] We talk about it like layers of the\n[36:13] earth. And above the surface are the\n[36:15] words and sounds that you hear while\n[36:17] people are talking. Right at the surface\n[36:19] are people's emotions. So I feel excited\n[36:22] but you feel tired and bored. That's\n[36:25] going to be uh tough. Right below that\n[36:28] are people's motives. What I want to\n[36:30] that gets back to the compass. What I\n[36:32] want to achieve is different than what\n[36:33] you want to achieve. We're all walking\n[36:35] around with a compass in our mind and\n[36:37] they're different from each other. Right\n[36:39] below that are our beliefs. Right? I\n[36:41] believe that immigration is a problem\n[36:44] and you believe that AI is a way bigger\n[36:48] problem than human immigration.\n[36:50] >> Um how do we talk about that in a way\n[36:52] and then all of it get dips down to the\n[36:54] the sort of hot magma in this layers of\n[36:56] the earth model of our identities. So\n[36:58] even an easy conversation, we're on a\n[37:00] date or we're two spouses are driving in\n[37:03] a car or friends are hanging out\n[37:05] watching a movie, like you can stumble\n[37:07] upon these little moments of difficulty\n[37:09] any time for any reason and you need to\n[37:12] have the skill set to be able to make\n[37:14] sure the temperature doesn't get too\n[37:16] hot.\n[37:17] >> What is that skill set?\n[37:18] >> There's a fabulous research on this. I\n[37:20] have found it incredibly helpful in my\n[37:22] life um research by Julia Mincson, Mike\n[37:24] Yman's, Hannah Collins called\n[37:26] receptiveness. So it's receptiveness to\n[37:29] opposing viewpoints and it's both the\n[37:32] mindset when you when someone comes to\n[37:34] you with something that seems crazy,\n[37:38] you don't judge it negatively. You have\n[37:40] to fight the human instinct to think of\n[37:42] it as like that's crazy, that's wrong,\n[37:45] and now I'm going to win and now I'm\n[37:48] going to be right and prove you wrong.\n[37:50] Because all of those instincts ruin our\n[37:53] conversations and our relationships.\n[37:55] >> Why? It makes us defensive on the\n[37:58] receiving end. It makes us sort of\n[38:01] accusatory and hostile on the attack\n[38:03] end. Once we get into an accusation and\n[38:06] defense mode, the conversation is broken\n[38:08] down. It's no longer\n[38:11] about connection favoring, protecting,\n[38:13] and advancing. We're now in this new\n[38:15] world that is not achieving any of our\n[38:17] goals.\n[38:18] >> She says someone comes to me and comes\n[38:20] to you and says something crazy. They\n[38:21] say, you know, the sky is purple. Yeah,\n[38:25] >> it's actually it's not blue, it's\n[38:26] purple.\n[38:27] >> Here's a magical phrase that you can say\n[38:29] in that moment. It makes sense that you\n[38:31] feel that the sky is purple. It makes\n[38:33] sense that you feel excited to tell me\n[38:35] that the sky is purple. It makes sense\n[38:37] that you feel X about Y. Makes sense\n[38:40] that you feel skeptical about podcasts.\n[38:43] It makes you It makes sense that you\n[38:45] feel annoyed that I speak quickly. It\n[38:48] makes sense that you are worried about\n[38:51] AI. Whatever people are feeling,\n[38:52] whatever they express to you, we can\n[38:55] validate that feeling because whatever\n[38:57] is going on in their mind is their\n[38:58] reality. And we have to say that out\n[39:01] loud before we go on to do anything\n[39:03] else, even if we're about to disagree\n[39:05] with them vehemently.\n[39:07] But we have to say the validation piece\n[39:09] first just like therapists do all the\n[39:11] time in order for them to feel heard and\n[39:14] like, \"Oh yeah, I'm safe here so that I\n[39:16] can join you on your side of the table\n[39:18] and now we're going to untangle this\n[39:19] weird problem together.\" You say the sky\n[39:22] is purple. Tell me more like what how\n[39:25] did you come to feel like the sky is\n[39:26] purple? Um are do you are you color\n[39:29] blind? Are you do you see everything in\n[39:32] purple? Like now I can ask you questions\n[39:34] about how you came to that perspective\n[39:37] and we can learn I can learn about it.\n[39:39] >> I guess the risk is you don't want to\n[39:40] >> validate something wrong.\n[39:42] >> Yeah.\n[39:43] >> Why not?\n[39:43] >> You don't want to appear to be saying\n[39:45] cuz if I say it makes sense that you\n[39:47] think the sky is purple but it's\n[39:48] actually blue.\n[39:49] >> The word thinks is important. It's it\n[39:51] makes sense that you feel X about Y.\n[39:55] >> Not it makes sense that you think X\n[39:57] about Y. Thinking is like a cognition.\n[40:00] >> Is the risk of it sounding patronizing?\n[40:02] Maybe, but in in in practice it feels\n[40:05] really really good. When I run this, so\n[40:07] I run an exercise in my class where we\n[40:09] go around. Let's say there there's a\n[40:10] group of five students and you have to\n[40:14] share something. We start easy like\n[40:16] share one song you love and then the\n[40:19] next person has to validate that before\n[40:20] they share their favorite next song. And\n[40:23] you go around and around very quickly.\n[40:25] And so it feels very contrived to say,\n[40:27] okay, you have to say, I love that you\n[40:29] love that Taylor Swift song. That's so\n[40:30] interesting. I actually don't like\n[40:32] Taylor Swift. It feels very contrived,\n[40:35] but when you talk to the students after\n[40:37] it, they say, \"Yes, I knew what we were\n[40:39] doing.\" It did feel over the top to say\n[40:41] that about people's song preferences.\n[40:43] And still, it felt amazing to have the\n[40:46] person next to me say, \"I love that you\n[40:48] love that Taylor Swift song.\"\n[40:50] Validation. We are all so hungry for\n[40:52] validation that even ridiculous\n[40:54] validation feels amazing. So then when\n[40:57] you get to round two and everybody's\n[40:59] sharing something that they're really\n[41:00] struggling with and the person next to\n[41:03] them says, \"Wow, I'm so sorry. That\n[41:05] sounds really, really hard.\" It makes\n[41:07] sense that you feel upset about your\n[41:08] mom. Now you've got that habit and\n[41:12] you're making them feel quite good about\n[41:14] something that actually does deserve\n[41:16] that validation. So it's all about like\n[41:19] developing these habits no matter where\n[41:22] the difference or disagreement is coming\n[41:24] from. What's the opposite of that?\n[41:27] >> The opposite is what how people\n[41:29] naturally respond, tend to naturally\n[41:31] respond, which is by trying to win and\n[41:34] prove them wrong and prove that they're\n[41:35] right. So you say the sky is purple and\n[41:38] I say that's crazy. Skye's blue.\n[41:42] And then where does our conversation go?\n[41:44] It feels terrible for you. It's so I\n[41:46] learned this um [clears throat]\n[41:49] because I employed this person once and\n[41:51] this person when we'd talk about ideas\n[41:54] the first word out of their mouth was\n[41:55] always I disagree and then they'd make\n[41:58] their point.\n[41:58] >> That's right.\n[41:59] >> And I don't know what it was about it,\n[42:01] but I noticed that it would like get my\n[42:02] backup\n[42:03] >> of course.\n[42:04] >> And so I'd say I don't know. I'd say I\n[42:06] think we should do it like this. I\n[42:07] disagree. Yeah.\n[42:08] >> And then they'd make their point. And I\n[42:09] remember thinking, gosh, that's such a\n[42:11] >> And it's so ironic because their goal is\n[42:14] to persuade you. At the end of it, they\n[42:16] want you to agree with their position.\n[42:18] That's not at all how persuasion works.\n[42:21] The only way that we change our beliefs\n[42:23] is is usually across many conversations.\n[42:26] And we're around someone we like talking\n[42:28] to and respect and have admiration for.\n[42:31] And then over time, we sort of bend to\n[42:34] the gentle pressure of their differing\n[42:35] viewpoint.\n[42:37] If I say, \"I disagree. Now, let's fight\n[42:40] about it.\"\n[42:41] >> You're you get your backup and you're\n[42:43] not having you're not enjoying talking\n[42:45] to me. Even if you're right and right,\n[42:48] like it's not about being right or wrong\n[42:50] in that moment.\n[42:51] >> The goal here is to keep the\n[42:53] conversation in an emotional place where\n[42:55] it can continue. So, you can continue to\n[42:57] engage. And that's what these\n[42:59] researchers find in this receptiveness\n[43:01] research is there. If you qualify your\n[43:03] statement saying like, \"I wonder if the\n[43:05] sky could be a different color rather\n[43:07] than the sky is blue with certainty.\"\n[43:10] There are all of these sort of hedging\n[43:12] language, you can divide yourself into\n[43:14] multiple parts. So if you said to me,\n[43:15] \"The sky is purple,\" I would say, \"Oh my\n[43:17] gosh, as your friend and as a painter,\n[43:19] that is so intriguing to me.\" As a\n[43:21] biologist or as a as a meteorologist,\n[43:24] maybe we should investigate that.\n[43:26] >> Um, literally dividing yourself into two\n[43:29] disagreeing parts. It's usually how we\n[43:31] actually feel. So if your mother says\n[43:33] something crazy to you that seems crazy\n[43:35] to you, you could say as your daughter,\n[43:37] I'm so intrigued that you've come to\n[43:38] hold that perspective. I'd love to hear\n[43:40] more. You know, as a representative of\n[43:42] Gen Z, I know my friends would want you\n[43:44] want me to say this. It means that you\n[43:47] can hold two perspectives at once and it\n[43:49] is very helpful to the other person to\n[43:51] keep the conversation going. But all of\n[43:54] the elements of this receptiveness\n[43:55] recipe have have this flavor. It's a\n[43:57] little surprising. I think often people\n[43:59] think of these types of things as\n[44:01] weakness because it's like our our\n[44:03] instinct is to try to win and be right.\n[44:06] And instead, what I'm saying is no,\n[44:08] hedge your claims. Show that you're\n[44:10] uncertain about stuff. Validate their\n[44:12] feelings. Divide yourself into\n[44:14] disagreeing parts because you're not\n[44:15] certain about anything in order to keep\n[44:18] the conversation going so that you have\n[44:20] any shred of hope of persuading them\n[44:22] over the longer term. I remember Tali\n[44:24] Sharrett telling me about a study\n[44:26] either. She told me, she's a\n[44:27] neuroscientist in London and she told me\n[44:29] they put two people in a brain imaging\n[44:32] scanner and got them to like look at\n[44:34] photos and come to agreement on the\n[44:37] price of something. Yes.\n[44:38] >> And then eventually in these studies,\n[44:40] I'm super paraphrasing here. She's\n[44:41] probably like cringing.\n[44:42] >> I think I know what study you're talking\n[44:43] about.\n[44:43] >> Oh, do could you explain it?\n[44:45] >> Yeah. So, so they studied what what\n[44:47] lights up in your brain when you're in a\n[44:50] situation of disagreement versus\n[44:51] agreement. And it is actually more\n[44:53] taxing to your mind when someone is\n[44:56] disagreeing with you. It's like these\n[44:57] neurological um alarm bells go off and\n[45:01] all of a sudden\n[45:02] >> like you describe what was your afraid?\n[45:04] My back goes up. What was\n[45:05] >> Yeah, my back goes up. I get my back up.\n[45:06] Yeah,\n[45:06] >> that's it. It's actually in your brain.\n[45:07] Your brain goes up and it's hard. It's\n[45:09] it's very hard to continue to engage\n[45:12] once that process is underway.\n[45:14] >> Yeah.\n[45:15] >> Right. Some people call it amydal\n[45:16] hijacking, which is not quite right. Um,\n[45:19] but your brain does look different when\n[45:21] you're in a situation of disagreement.\n[45:23] So, whatever we can do conversationally\n[45:24] to sort of tamp that down so that your\n[45:27] back doesn't go up [clears throat]\n[45:28] >> is going to be quite helpful.\n[45:30] >> She showed pictures of the brain in\n[45:33] these scans when someone disagrees with\n[45:34] you. And I think, and I might be getting\n[45:36] this inverted, that it was almost like\n[45:38] the brain had shut down to\n[45:40] receptiveness. Yes. In that moment it\n[45:42] was like so I always when I wrote this\n[45:44] chapter in my book called do not\n[45:45] disagree. It's it's an intentionally\n[45:47] provocative chapter because people think\n[45:48] what do you mean never disagree with\n[45:49] anybody but I mean like don't make the\n[45:51] first thing you say I disagree.\n[45:53] >> That's right. It can come later. It can\n[45:55] come later but first has to come like oh\n[45:57] it's so intriguing that you said that.\n[45:58] I'm so fascinated and it makes sense\n[46:00] that you might feel that way. I wonder\n[46:01] if and then you can go on instead of I\n[46:04] disagree. I met a girl called an who\n[46:08] always said yes and instead of but\n[46:11] >> good\n[46:12] >> and it shocked me because it was so\n[46:14] different. I having a conversation with\n[46:15] her, you say something to her and you go\n[46:17] I think this and she goes yes and and\n[46:19] then she would make her point and it\n[46:20] could be a complete disagreement but I\n[46:22] noticed she was doing it and I loved it.\n[46:24] >> Yeah. Oh yeah. And you we often think of\n[46:26] the yes and as part of sort of improv\n[46:28] comedy humor etc. They were the\n[46:31] comedians were really on to something\n[46:33] much more profound about conversation\n[46:35] broadly. If you can come from a sort of\n[46:38] mindset or like spiritual place of yes\n[46:41] and essentially you're saying uh I'm\n[46:44] going to give you the benefit of the\n[46:45] doubt here even though it what you're\n[46:47] saying seems a little crazy.\n[46:49] >> Mhm.\n[46:49] >> That's what is required to have great\n[46:51] relationships. It's like we're all going\n[46:53] to have these moments where someone\n[46:55] feels something or says something that\n[46:56] seems crazy. And if you react to it in\n[47:00] an invalidating way,\n[47:02] that's how we kill our relationships.\n[47:05] >> Do we need to kill the word but? Because\n[47:07] what ends up happening is someone will\n[47:08] say the thing you just said about\n[47:10] validating relationships. Yes, I\n[47:11] completely understand. Um I think you\n[47:13] made a great point, Allison, but. And\n[47:15] the minute I say but, it's kind of like\n[47:16] I've just taken an eraser to everything\n[47:18] you just said.\n[47:19] >> I would love to get rid of the word but.\n[47:21] Not but with two T's but but with one T.\n[47:23] Yes. [laughter]\n[47:27] >> Yeah. You never need it. You can make\n[47:29] the same point and say and\n[47:33] >> but [laughter] like it just completely\n[47:35] it just it immediately says\n[47:37] >> it rever it also reveals that you're\n[47:39] sitting there\n[47:41] in a state of I I can't wait. I'm like\n[47:44] on the tip of my tongue is something I\n[47:46] can't wait to say that's opposite of\n[47:48] what you're saying. And it's the the\n[47:50] spirit of it is is antagonistic.\n[47:53] >> One of the things we notice when we have\n[47:55] conversations on this show about uh\n[47:56] about conversation\n[47:58] >> is people really care about likability.\n[48:01] >> Yes.\n[48:02] >> Like they they really want to know\n[48:03] what's making them disliked and they\n[48:05] really want to know how to be liked.\n[48:06] >> Good. So being liked is a huge drive. Um\n[48:12] but it's just one of many things that we\n[48:14] we care about in terms of gaining\n[48:16] status. So status is uh respect,\n[48:18] admiration, liking in the eyes of other\n[48:20] people. Liking is usually comes from\n[48:22] sort of warmth and charm. Uh admiration\n[48:26] often comes from like perceptions of\n[48:27] competence. So we want warmth and\n[48:30] competence at once ideally. Okay. Let's\n[48:33] go back in time. Should we talk about\n[48:34] the talk framework because they're going\n[48:35] to be little clues about how to be\n[48:38] better liked across the whole framework.\n[48:40] >> Okay. [laughter]\n[48:40] >> Okay. Let's start with T. I'm going to\n[48:44] push these to the side. T is first I\n[48:47] just want to say as a whole framework\n[48:48] TAK\n[48:50] is the most comprehensive teachable\n[48:53] practical scientifically rigorous\n[48:56] framework in the world for\n[48:58] communication.\n[48:59] >> Did you invent it?\n[49:00] >> I did.\n[49:00] >> So you would say that\n[49:01] >> but I didn't when I first wrote the book\n[49:03] I didn't say it strongly enough. And in\n[49:06] the last almost year I've come to\n[49:08] realize why. One part is because most\n[49:11] people focus only on difficult\n[49:13] conversations and here we are focusing\n[49:15] on all conversations even the ones that\n[49:16] seem like they should be easy and fun.\n[49:19] It's all conversations everywhere\n[49:21] personal and professional. The other\n[49:23] piece is that I didn't even really\n[49:25] intend this as a scientist but the way\n[49:27] we do research is essentially uh natural\n[49:29] language processing machine learning\n[49:31] fits into this new world of AI. So the\n[49:34] framework can be used by humans or\n[49:37] machines to coach people to be better\n[49:39] conversationalists and used as a rubric\n[49:41] after the fact of saying, \"Okay, how did\n[49:43] this go? Did you do well? Let's look at\n[49:45] T A L K and evaluate.\"\n[49:48] >> Okay, it's the best in the world ever. I\n[49:50] >> thank you, Stephen. Okay, thank you.\n[49:52] >> Um, thank you for recognizing.\n[49:53] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[49:54] >> Okay. T is for topics.\n[49:56] >> Topics.\n[49:57] >> Topics. Topics are the building blocks\n[50:00] of conversation. It is what we choose to\n[50:03] talk about.\n[50:04] >> Okay,\n[50:04] >> very simple. We all have an intuitive\n[50:06] understanding that we sort of work\n[50:08] through different chunks. First, we're\n[50:10] going to talk about your conversation\n[50:12] with your girlfriend. Then, we're going\n[50:13] to talk about the talk framework. Then,\n[50:15] we're talk about the compass, whatever.\n[50:16] We're working through topics. What I\n[50:18] think most people don't realize is that\n[50:20] we're choosing topics every time we\n[50:22] talk. It's not just at the beginning of\n[50:25] a conversation like an opener like,\n[50:28] \"Hey, what do you think of this, you\n[50:29] know, the diplomat?\" No, it's every time\n[50:31] you're talking, we're making moves to\n[50:32] gently stay on topic or switch to\n[50:35] something else. What's so beautiful\n[50:37] about that is it means we all have\n[50:39] power. We all have control to nudge the\n[50:43] conversation one way or another.\n[50:46] And we can all do a better job with it.\n[50:49] >> So, what's the game here? To pick better\n[50:51] topics, to know what topic we're aiming\n[50:53] at.\n[50:54] >> There's a lot of goals. It's both about\n[50:56] choosing better topics. It's also about\n[50:58] how can we make any topic better. Okay,\n[51:02] one huge piece of advice that when you\n[51:05] start to realize how much your mind is\n[51:07] doing during a live conversation is to\n[51:10] offload some of that cognitive work to\n[51:12] beforehand.\n[51:13] >> Okay.\n[51:13] >> Okay. [clears throat] So, prepping\n[51:14] topics ahead of time. This does not mean\n[51:17] writing out an agenda before you call\n[51:19] your parents or before you call your\n[51:21] girlfriend. What it does mean is\n[51:23] spending even 30 seconds, maybe even 10\n[51:26] seconds before you're in the chaos of a\n[51:28] conversation to think about what you\n[51:30] could talk about or what might be\n[51:32] important for you to remember to talk\n[51:33] about.\n[51:33] >> Did you do that today?\n[51:35] >> Always.\n[51:36] >> Sometimes you don't have to, right? Like\n[51:37] you did it today. You did extensive\n[51:39] prep. Um, you even have things printed\n[51:42] on cards here.\n[51:43] >> And in a [clears throat] way, I have\n[51:45] been prepping for this conversation for\n[51:46] 20 years. I've been studying these\n[51:48] things. I designed the framework myself.\n[51:50] I've gone on 80 other, you know,\n[51:52] podcasts. I that's all prep for this\n[51:55] moment.\n[51:56] >> What about in your personal life?\n[51:58] >> Yeah.\n[51:58] >> Can you give me an example of where you\n[51:59] prepared topics?\n[52:00] >> Every conversation that I know is\n[52:01] coming. I give an example.\n[52:03] >> So with Casi uh before I got here,\n[52:06] >> which is a member of our team.\n[52:08] >> Yes. Thank you. I thought about I wanted\n[52:11] to ask her what it's like to be moving\n[52:14] from London to LA. I wanted to ask her\n[52:17] what it's like to work with you. She\n[52:18] said all good. All good things.\n[52:20] [laughter]\n[52:21] >> All good things. Next question. What\n[52:23] does A mean? [laughter]\n[52:26] >> So funny. Um I often will um so you can\n[52:30] It's not rocket science. It's literally\n[52:33] just a little bit of forethought. What\n[52:35] kinds of questions or topics could I ask\n[52:37] you that will make our conversation feel\n[52:39] a little bit better than just like\n[52:41] winging it in the moment and talking\n[52:43] about like some random thing I see in\n[52:44] the room?\n[52:45] >> Mh. [clears throat]\n[52:46] I try to do this before every\n[52:47] conversation because now I know how\n[52:49] powerful it is and how kind it is. If\n[52:51] you are calling somebody and you're\n[52:53] like, \"Okay, oh yeah, their kid was\n[52:55] going to take guitar lessons. I should\n[52:56] remember to ask about that.\" Or, \"Oh, my\n[52:58] friend had this big presentation at\n[53:00] work. I should remember to ask how that\n[53:02] went.\" That means you're going to\n[53:03] remember to ask them and that's super\n[53:06] kind and it they're excited to talk\n[53:07] about it, too. It makes everything\n[53:09] better. So, topic prep is a huge deal.\n[53:12] In our research, what we find when you\n[53:13] randomly assign people to prep topics or\n[53:16] not, the conversations where people have\n[53:18] thought ahead even for 30 seconds, they\n[53:20] feel less anxious. They're much\n[53:22] smoother. There are fewer disfluencies,\n[53:23] so ums, stutters between topics. They\n[53:27] cover more topics, which is usually a\n[53:29] good thing. More likely to land on good\n[53:31] topics. You're less likely to blurt, so\n[53:34] you're less likely to share things that\n[53:35] you don't want to share with people.\n[53:38] It's just an incredibly powerful\n[53:40] strategy and it doesn't need to be\n[53:42] complicated. I've gotten in the habit of\n[53:44] putting like two or three bullet points\n[53:46] for people in my Google calendar notes\n[53:48] when you know you have a meeting coming\n[53:49] up and and you don't even have to do it\n[53:51] right before like oh a week ahead of\n[53:53] time if it pops in my head that I want\n[53:55] to ask Stephen about do you want to have\n[53:57] children I might write that as a little\n[53:59] bullet point in my calendar note for the\n[54:01] time that I'm going to be here with you\n[54:03] and then I'll be more likely to remember\n[54:05] it. Do you feel skeptical about this?\n[54:08] >> No. I was just thinking it probably\n[54:10] makes you more, going back to the point\n[54:11] about likability, it probably makes you\n[54:13] a more likable person.\n[54:14] >> Much more likable. Yeah. In fact, if you\n[54:16] can achieve more of your goals, whether\n[54:19] they're high informational,\n[54:20] lowformational, high relational, low\n[54:22] relational, um, all of that makes you\n[54:25] more likable. You you seem more\n[54:26] competent. You seem more warm,\n[54:28] especially when you lean towards those\n[54:29] pro-social, high relational uh, goals.\n[54:32] Cuz everyone talks about how if you're\n[54:33] interested in someone else, like you\n[54:35] were interested in Cozy.\n[54:36] >> Yes,\n[54:36] >> that must have felt good for her, which\n[54:38] must make her like you more.\n[54:39] >> We should go ask her.\n[54:42] >> That's a good point.\n[54:43] >> I ask um I have my students sometimes do\n[54:45] a reflection task where I say, \"If you\n[54:47] had to walk into a room and your your\n[54:49] job was to make people like you a one\n[54:50] out of 10, a five out of 10, or a 10 out\n[54:54] of 10, what are the behaviors that you\n[54:56] would do to try and pursue those three\n[54:59] worlds?\" Okay. So, if I wanted people to\n[55:00] like me, one out of 10. Yeah. What What\n[55:03] would you do? You tell me. You tell me.\n[55:04] You're the expert. [laughter]\n[55:06] >> I want to hear your I want to hear your\n[55:07] guesses.\n[55:08] >> My guesses I would walk in quiet on my\n[55:12] phone and I would ignore them and maybe\n[55:16] [clears throat] I'd look up and make\n[55:17] some kind of snide comment. I definitely\n[55:19] wouldn't notice that they were there.\n[55:21] >> Yeah.\n[55:21] >> And I\n[55:24] wouldn't make eye contact with them. I\n[55:28] >> would maybe be rid like take a phone\n[55:30] call.\n[55:31] >> I was gonna say you one's really low. So\n[55:33] you probably insults probably.\n[55:35] >> Oh yeah, I'd offend them.\n[55:36] >> Yeah, offend [clears throat] them.\n[55:39] >> Maybe take a phone call and then while\n[55:40] you're on the phone call, talk about how\n[55:42] great you are. Or something, right? Like\n[55:44] some sort of arrogance, etc.\n[55:46] >> Um maybe if they try and talk to you,\n[55:49] interrupt them.\n[55:50] >> Yeah.\n[55:50] >> Uh and be like, \"Not now.\"\n[55:52] >> Or look at my phone midway through what\n[55:53] they're saying. Like Yeah.\n[55:55] >> Yeah. Okay. So there's lots of things\n[55:56] you can imagine there.\n[55:58] >> Okay.\n[55:58] >> Already we've touched on topics though,\n[56:00] right? When you think about, okay, I'm\n[56:01] talking on the phone in front of them\n[56:03] and what am I going to be talking about\n[56:05] that reduces my likability even for\n[56:07] someone who's like just observing you\n[56:09] talking?\n[56:09] >> I'd get the name.\n[56:10] >> That's great. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.\n[56:12] >> That's a good way to say you don't\n[56:13] matter to me.\n[56:14] >> Yeah. Yeah. Five out of 10 is an\n[56:16] interesting one. You want to do it's\n[56:18] probably more blaszeise like you engage\n[56:21] with them but not very well.\n[56:24] Talk about small talk topics like you\n[56:26] were saying things that you could talk\n[56:27] about with anyone that are not\n[56:28] personalized at all seem a bit\n[56:30] disinterested\n[56:32] um but not offensive just bland.\n[56:35] >> Okay.\n[56:35] >> Okay. Then we get to 10 out of 10 world.\n[56:38] You\n[56:38] >> 10 out of 10 liability.\n[56:39] >> Yeah. What are what are you doing if\n[56:41] you're trying to get 10 out of 10?\n[56:42] >> I am completely focused on them.\n[56:44] >> Good. Um, I'm attentive. I'm\n[56:47] complimentary. I'm gonna flatter them.\n[56:49] >> Yeah.\n[56:49] >> Um,\n[56:50] >> do you think it will seem obquous?\n[56:52] >> And I don't know if I get it right.\n[56:54] >> Okay.\n[56:54] >> Um, because I'm going to mean it.\n[56:56] >> Yeah. Cuz it's going to be sincere.\n[56:57] >> It's going to be really sincere.\n[56:58] >> Yeah.\n[56:59] >> I'm going to crack a great joke.\n[57:00] >> Yes.\n[57:01] >> Knock knock.\n[57:02] >> Yeah. Who's there?\n[57:02] >> I don't know. I [laughter]\n[57:04] like I don't know. My friend, didn't\n[57:06] you?\n[57:06] >> Exactly.\n[57:07] >> So, yeah, I'm going to flatter them.\n[57:09] Crack jokes. Be very attentive. Get\n[57:11] their name right. Ask them about their\n[57:12] grandchild.\n[57:13] >> Good. Okay, let's pause. I want to in\n[57:16] that description already you're moving\n[57:18] quite quickly through topics as you're\n[57:21] interacting with them. You know that you\n[57:23] can't be circling the drain talking\n[57:25] about the weather for long periods of\n[57:28] time. So just briefly let me say we\n[57:30] don't need to avoid small talk. In fact,\n[57:32] it's a very important social ritual for\n[57:35] people who are strangers to each other,\n[57:37] people who haven't seen each other in a\n[57:38] long time. It's where we land and say,\n[57:40] \"Oh, we're doing conversation now.\" The\n[57:43] mistake that people make is\n[57:46] they stay there too long. Way too long.\n[57:49] Any more than like one beat of, \"Oh my\n[57:52] goodness, the weather's really warm.\n[57:53] It's like summer in California.\" Then\n[57:55] you need to make it more personal and\n[57:58] move up this topic pyramid towards\n[58:00] medium talk, deep talk quickly. Right?\n[58:03] So small talk is at the bottom. These\n[58:04] are topics anybody can talk about.\n[58:06] Tailored talk is more exciting, more\n[58:08] personalized, more relevant to your\n[58:10] interests. Deep talk is the peak of this\n[58:12] pyramid. Only we can talk about this\n[58:15] thing in this special way. Not every\n[58:17] conversation is bound to get to the deep\n[58:19] talk, but when it does, we should feel\n[58:21] very appreciative. It's one of the most\n[58:23] magical things about being humans. Um,\n[58:26] so we don't need to get to deep talk\n[58:28] with like the barista at Starbucks or\n[58:29] with your neighbor when they're taking\n[58:31] out their trash, but it does happen\n[58:33] sometimes and it's quite lovely. I think\n[58:35] I used to put girls off when I was 11\n[58:37] because I used to ask them like the\n[58:38] meaning of life too quickly on my mother\n[58:40] stole a Nokia phone.\n[58:40] >> Yeah.\n[58:41] >> And so they would stop texting back.\n[58:43] >> Yeah.\n[58:44] >> So I I think I learned early that like\n[58:45] some people just don't like\n[58:46] >> Well, the joke's on them now. Now you\n[58:48] get to do it for your for your life's\n[58:49] work. No, but I think we you were on to\n[58:52] something there. It's not that you asked\n[58:53] them about the meaning of life at all.\n[58:55] You asked it too quickly.\n[58:57] >> So getting it's about the pacing as we\n[58:59] move up here. Most people stay too long\n[59:01] at the bottom, but we also cannot jump\n[59:03] to the top often. You kind of have to do\n[59:05] the ritual of climbing to feel like you\n[59:08] get there in a natural way.\n[59:09] >> And is that where relationships are\n[59:11] built? Deep ones\n[59:12] >> for sure.\n[59:12] >> At the top\n[59:13] >> moments at the top probably, right? This\n[59:15] is where vulnerability takes you. Um,\n[59:18] often asking lots of questions,\n[59:20] especially follow-up questions, gets you\n[59:22] up the pyramid more quickly. So shall we\n[59:25] shall we shift to the A of the talk\n[59:27] framework because A is for\n[59:30] asking. Uh topics and asking are\n[59:33] intimately tied to each other. The most\n[59:36] common way that people switch topics is\n[59:38] by asking a question. So you can use\n[59:41] questions like what are you excited\n[59:42] about recently? Or what has been your\n[59:44] favorite guest to talk to? Or what have\n[59:47] you and your girlfriend done together\n[59:48] recently? You can you do that to switch\n[59:50] topics. Once you're on a topic, we use\n[59:53] follow-up questions to kind of dive\n[59:55] deeply and move up the topic pyramid.\n[59:58] Um,\n[59:59] >> so are you saying I should ask more\n[01:00:01] questions?\n[01:00:02] >> Yes.\n[01:00:03] >> Okay. Well, ask more than they're asking\n[01:00:04] me.\n[01:00:05] >> Maybe not you because you spend a lot of\n[01:00:06] time asking questions, but most people\n[01:00:09] the topline advice to make their\n[01:00:11] conversations better is to ask many more\n[01:00:13] questions.\n[01:00:15] asking. It sounds so simple and it's\n[01:00:18] almost like everybody already knows\n[01:00:19] that, but doing it in practice is quite\n[01:00:22] hard and it's a skill. And people who do\n[01:00:25] it well are more successful on romantic\n[01:00:28] dates. They're more successful in work\n[01:00:31] meetings. They're more successful as\n[01:00:32] collaborators. They're more successful\n[01:00:34] as entrepreneurs in getting funding. All\n[01:00:36] of it hinges on on question asking. So\n[01:00:40] the topline advice, just ask more\n[01:00:42] questions. At the very least, don't be a\n[01:00:45] zero question asker.\n[01:00:46] >> What happens to the fate of zero\n[01:00:48] question askers?\n[01:00:48] >> Oh, they're not they're not getting a\n[01:00:50] second date. They're not going to get\n[01:00:52] that funding. They're not they're not\n[01:00:53] learning enough about their partner to\n[01:00:56] enable them to succeed. If you go on a\n[01:00:59] first date and you're asking zero\n[01:01:01] questions, which like imagine that we've\n[01:01:03] all sort of been on that date probably,\n[01:01:05] you want to leave within 10 minutes.\n[01:01:08] When you're on a first date, you have so\n[01:01:10] much to learn about each other. M\n[01:01:12] >> you [clears throat]\n[01:01:13] have everything to learn about each\n[01:01:15] other. So if someone's not asking, it's\n[01:01:17] a real real real problem. Especially I\n[01:01:21] think this is a very especially good\n[01:01:23] hack for men um on heterosexual dates.\n[01:01:27] Often what they're getting wrong is that\n[01:01:29] they're not asking enough questions.\n[01:01:30] >> How'd you know this?\n[01:01:32] >> From data. [laughter]\n[01:01:33] >> From data.\n[01:01:34] >> Yeah. Yeah. So, we have a thousand speed\n[01:01:35] dates and we uh the outcome is does your\n[01:01:40] the other person want to go on a second\n[01:01:41] date with you and we have transcripts.\n[01:01:44] It was an amazing study run by this\n[01:01:46] incredible research group at Stanford\n[01:01:48] about 10 years ago and you can just\n[01:01:50] measure it. Measure how many questions\n[01:01:51] they ask on each date. People who ask\n[01:01:54] more questions are enormously more\n[01:01:56] likely to get asked to on a second date.\n[01:01:59] So much. So, imagine you go on 20 first\n[01:02:01] dates and I say, \"Okay, Stephen, you\n[01:02:04] just have to ask one extra question on\n[01:02:07] those 20 dates. If you do, you'll\n[01:02:10] convert another date into a second date\n[01:02:13] from just one question per date,\n[01:02:14] >> according to the data.\"\n[01:02:15] >> Yes. It's true for both men and women,\n[01:02:20] but it's particularly helpful for men\n[01:02:22] because they ask fewer questions on\n[01:02:24] average than women do.\n[01:02:25] >> Really?\n[01:02:26] >> Yeah.\n[01:02:26] >> Significantly less.\n[01:02:27] >> Yes. And the other funny gender effect\n[01:02:30] in the data is that men are just more\n[01:02:32] likely to agree to go on second dates.\n[01:02:33] They're less discerning in general.\n[01:02:36] But if they want if if men want to get\n[01:02:39] asked on the second date, just ask more\n[01:02:41] questions.\n[01:02:42] >> What is it me asking more questions\n[01:02:43] doing to the other person?\n[01:02:45] >> It makes them feel heard and like you\n[01:02:47] want to know their answer, that you're\n[01:02:48] interested in them. And so it signals\n[01:02:51] your interest, but also you learn what's\n[01:02:53] in their mind and what their experience\n[01:02:55] is, which gives arms you with more\n[01:02:57] information that to then ask more better\n[01:02:59] questions. So it's not just about asking\n[01:03:02] more, although that's a good start. It's\n[01:03:04] about asking f great follow-up\n[01:03:05] questions. The the the benefits of\n[01:03:08] question asking are almost entirely\n[01:03:10] driven by the power of follow-up\n[01:03:13] questions.\n[01:03:13] >> So what? Give me an example of asking a\n[01:03:15] great follow-up question.\n[01:03:16] >> We're on a date. It's uh there's food.\n[01:03:18] It's going really well. I've just shared\n[01:03:20] with you that I went on an amazing walk\n[01:03:22] down the Sunset Strip this morning.\n[01:03:25] >> And then I would say, \"Really? Oh my\n[01:03:27] god, I've always wanted to go. Tell me\n[01:03:29] tell me about it. How was it?\"\n[01:03:30] >> Oh, incredible. Um, so I got to this\n[01:03:33] point. I had never been here there\n[01:03:34] before. There was I had to decide, was I\n[01:03:37] going to veer off and go see um the\n[01:03:40] Marilyn Monroe apartment, which by the\n[01:03:42] way is right next to the Frank Lidd\n[01:03:43] Wright house. Oh my god. or was I going\n[01:03:45] to go a few blocks away was the um\n[01:03:47] Mendez brothers house.\n[01:03:49] >> Who's that?\n[01:03:50] >> The two brothers who killed their\n[01:03:52] parents.\n[01:03:52] >> Oh, on Netflix.\n[01:03:53] >> Yeah.\n[01:03:54] >> Oh, wow. Okay.\n[01:03:54] >> So, I would literally right in between\n[01:03:56] and I was at this crossroads. Do I\n[01:03:58] choose Cultured? Do I choose Morbid\n[01:04:01] Curiosity? Um,\n[01:04:03] >> and which one did you choose?\n[01:04:04] >> I went with Cultured. I was too afraid\n[01:04:06] by [laughter]\n[01:04:07] myself.\n[01:04:08] >> You're so cute.\n[01:04:10] >> So, okay. So, we Okay, we're off our\n[01:04:12] date now. That was so fun. you were\n[01:04:14] asking such lovely questions and it\n[01:04:16] really helped to like cheer me on like\n[01:04:18] you actually wanted to hear this story.\n[01:04:21] >> Um even though it might like someone\n[01:04:23] else might have been like not that\n[01:04:25] interested and then you feel embarrassed\n[01:04:27] like oh I just shared a bunch of\n[01:04:28] vulnerable stuff. I was walking alone in\n[01:04:31] LA. I had morbid curiosity about these\n[01:04:35] two brothers and this story. Um, it's\n[01:04:38] very easy to make someone feel\n[01:04:40] invalidated in that moment, but\n[01:04:41] follow-up questions make me feel like,\n[01:04:44] oh, he wants to know more. He's coming\n[01:04:45] with me on this journey.\n[01:04:47] >> So, did I do the right thing then?\n[01:04:48] >> Yeah, you were doing great.\n[01:04:49] >> Okay. Yeah.\n[01:04:50] >> And what's the wrong thing to have done\n[01:04:51] for me to just just\n[01:04:54] >> Oh, imagine if I had been like, \"Oh, I\n[01:04:55] went this on an amazing walk down the\n[01:04:57] Sunset Strip.\" And you said, \"Oh, my\n[01:04:59] favorite restaurant on the strip is a\n[01:05:00] sushi place.\"\n[01:05:01] >> Oh, [ __ ]\n[01:05:02] >> Um, I I went to this amazing restaurant\n[01:05:04] and I went to this amazing store. Uh,\n[01:05:06] yeah. They carried our mess. I bought an\n[01:05:07] amazing pair of boots. Um,\n[01:05:09] >> people do that all the time.\n[01:05:10] >> Constantly. So, this is called boomer\n[01:05:12] asking.\n[01:05:13] >> Boomer asking.\n[01:05:14] >> Not because of boomers. We love What are\n[01:05:16] you saying? It's for people of all ages.\n[01:05:18] Commit boomer. It's a boomerang.\n[01:05:20] >> Oh, okay.\n[01:05:20] >> So, I say to you, um,\n[01:05:22] >> I lost subscribers.\n[01:05:24] >> No, [laughter]\n[01:05:24] no, we love boomers. So, I say to you\n[01:05:27] like, Stephen, what's your favorite\n[01:05:28] restaurant?\n[01:05:30] >> Mr. Chows.\n[01:05:30] >> Oh, I've been to Mr. Chows. Last time I\n[01:05:32] went to Mr. house. I went with a whole\n[01:05:33] bunch of friends and I had a friend who\n[01:05:35] was really\n[01:05:35] >> all the time.\n[01:05:36] >> Yes. So, I've asked a question. You've\n[01:05:38] shared something with me that is such a\n[01:05:40] gift. Any sort of self-disclosure is\n[01:05:42] such a gift. And instead of saying, \"Oh,\n[01:05:44] who did you go with?\" or \"What did you\n[01:05:45] order?\" or \"What is it like inside? How\n[01:05:48] did you like it?\" Um, I bring it the\n[01:05:50] focus of the conversation right back to\n[01:05:52] myself.\n[01:05:54] >> People that do that don't know they do\n[01:05:56] it.\n[01:05:56] >> Correct. Because I will obviously, you\n[01:05:59] know, I we'll go for dinner or we'll\n[01:06:01] have, I don't know, 10 of my colleagues\n[01:06:02] there. And then sometimes I'll have one\n[01:06:04] particular colleague who is doing\n[01:06:06] exactly that.\n[01:06:06] >> Yes.\n[01:06:07] >> And they have no idea.\n[01:06:09] >> Don't you want to be like stop [ __ ]\n[01:06:11] just like ask them about their thing?\n[01:06:13] They're new here. We're trying to make\n[01:06:14] them feel comfortable.\n[01:06:15] >> Even one follow-up question might be\n[01:06:18] enough. And so if you use this mindset\n[01:06:20] of like ask the next question before you\n[01:06:24] pull it back to yourself, it sometimes\n[01:06:26] can be enough. probably many more\n[01:06:27] follow-up questions is better, but even\n[01:06:29] just one where I was like, \"Oh, who did\n[01:06:31] you go to Mr. Chows with?\" and I let you\n[01:06:33] answer and I say, \"Oh, I've been there,\n[01:06:35] too.\"\n[01:06:35] >> You can see it happening in their head\n[01:06:36] because you say the word Mr. Chow is\n[01:06:38] your favorite restaurant and they\n[01:06:39] immediately.\n[01:06:43] >> It makes sense that people do this. Our\n[01:06:45] brains are incredibly are wired to be\n[01:06:48] egocentric. We know all of our lived\n[01:06:50] experiences, our own, with 100%\n[01:06:54] accuracy. We lived it. It's all up here.\n[01:06:56] So, anything that we see or hear in our\n[01:06:58] conversations is of course going to\n[01:07:00] trigger all of these memories and\n[01:07:01] associations in your mind about your\n[01:07:03] lived experience. And it's such an enemy\n[01:07:06] of good conversation because it\n[01:07:08] constantly tugs you away from being\n[01:07:10] interested in the other person first.\n[01:07:12] The other thing I've seen in meetings,\n[01:07:14] which I've had to have a conversations\n[01:07:16] about historically, is when someone will\n[01:07:18] be talking and then someone's listening\n[01:07:20] going, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\"\n[01:07:22] And I know I'm like, \"Oh my god, they've\n[01:07:23] got something to say.\" And they're like,\n[01:07:25] \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\"\n[01:07:26] They'reing them out.\n[01:07:28] >> They're trying to them into silence so\n[01:07:30] that they can get their point across.\n[01:07:32] >> Yes.\n[01:07:33] >> And I've had to send messages in the\n[01:07:34] past to say, \"By the way, you were\n[01:07:35] saying, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" It\n[01:07:36] made it seem to an objective observer\n[01:07:39] like you weren't listening and actually\n[01:07:40] you were just trying to say something.\n[01:07:41] So just in the interest of your like,\n[01:07:43] you know, maybe\n[01:07:44] >> maybe don't\n[01:07:45] >> just don't say like\n[01:07:46] >> how do they respond to that? Oh, because\n[01:07:48] I didn't I constructed it more\n[01:07:50] >> tactfully\n[01:07:50] >> tactfully than I [laughter] just\n[01:07:51] described, but I thought about it a lot\n[01:07:53] and I just wanted to cuz I'd seen them\n[01:07:55] doing this 30 40 times in meetings.\n[01:07:58] >> Yeah.\n[01:07:58] >> And I don't think they realize how it's\n[01:08:01] perceived. Now you know how I feel\n[01:08:03] during so many conversations for so many\n[01:08:06] different reason. There are so many\n[01:08:07] things like that where you see other\n[01:08:09] people doing the dastardly\n[01:08:11] conversational thing and it's totally\n[01:08:14] understandable why they're excited. They\n[01:08:17] have a thing they want to say and it's\n[01:08:19] preventing them from actually engaging\n[01:08:21] with the person who's talking and and\n[01:08:23] what they're saying. All of these things\n[01:08:26] are understandable. I it's important to\n[01:08:28] come from a place of like of\n[01:08:29] non-judgment. Mhm.\n[01:08:30] >> It's because our brains were built to\n[01:08:33] wander, not focus on another person,\n[01:08:36] >> because we're deeply egocentric beings\n[01:08:38] and we focus on our own perspective.\n[01:08:41] >> Both of those things hold us back from\n[01:08:43] really being able to engage with someone\n[01:08:45] else. I want to go back to your thing of\n[01:08:47] like a 10 out of 10 likability. that\n[01:08:49] those are the little things, the little\n[01:08:51] um death by a thousand cuts to your\n[01:08:53] likability are these things where it's\n[01:08:55] like you're not able to actually really\n[01:08:57] focus on someone else and really engage\n[01:09:00] with what they're saying and ask\n[01:09:02] follow-up questions and then later in\n[01:09:04] the conversation call back to something\n[01:09:06] they said earlier because you're just\n[01:09:08] that clever. Um are there so much stands\n[01:09:11] in the way of of doing that. In that\n[01:09:14] particular example I'm thinking about, I\n[01:09:16] started to get\n[01:09:18] negative feedback from people that\n[01:09:20] worked with this person. And I noticed\n[01:09:22] one day the negative feedback was, I\n[01:09:24] don't think they're even listening to\n[01:09:26] me.\n[01:09:26] >> Yeah.\n[01:09:27] >> Um\n[01:09:27] >> cuz they're not\n[01:09:28] >> cuz they weren't really listening. And\n[01:09:30] so the minute I got the feedback was the\n[01:09:31] minute I thought, you know what,\n[01:09:32] Stephen, you've you've watched this\n[01:09:33] happen. You know, it's objectively true.\n[01:09:36] You owe it because you're this person's\n[01:09:38] report to have a conversation with them\n[01:09:39] about it because it's getting in the way\n[01:09:40] of their success. The the fascinating\n[01:09:43] thing for me is if I plot everybody I\n[01:09:45] know and work with on an axis of like\n[01:09:46] self-awareness as it relates to their\n[01:09:48] communication. Yeah.\n[01:09:49] >> Some people are just they kind of just\n[01:09:52] got have it. Y\n[01:09:53] >> and then some people are on the other\n[01:09:55] end of this spectrum where there's like\n[01:09:58] no apparent self-awareness of of like\n[01:10:00] how they're coming across\n[01:10:01] >> and they're so talented and so hardwork\n[01:10:04] but this one thing of like their\n[01:10:06] communication self-awareness is honestly\n[01:10:09] in some cases the single thing the\n[01:10:12] single gravitational force on their\n[01:10:13] career trajectory.\n[01:10:14] >> Yes.\n[01:10:15] >> And like can people change or is it just\n[01:10:17] like a genetic thing?\n[01:10:18] >> They can. Let first let me address there\n[01:10:21] are pros and cons to being at both ends\n[01:10:23] of that spectrum. If you are\n[01:10:25] >> too hypervigilant and too self-aware, it\n[01:10:28] can be distracting. It might mean that\n[01:10:31] you're sort of people pleasing too,\n[01:10:32] which can lead to burnout and\n[01:10:33] exhaustion. If you're at this lack of\n[01:10:36] self-awareness end, of course, it's\n[01:10:38] going to be a real problem. And so, I\n[01:10:41] love teaching and coaching people at\n[01:10:44] that end because you can become more\n[01:10:46] self-aware. So many of my students at\n[01:10:48] Harvard come into the course and that's\n[01:10:50] how they are.\n[01:10:52] >> What you mean?\n[01:10:53] >> They are not aware of what their\n[01:10:56] strengths and weaknesses are. They don't\n[01:10:57] know what they're doing right and wrong.\n[01:10:59] They just know they either hate\n[01:11:02] conversation or aren't good at it. And\n[01:11:04] so just by going through this talk\n[01:11:06] course, they become much more sort of\n[01:11:09] cleareyed and open to the fact that\n[01:11:11] conversation is a skill that matters\n[01:11:14] profoundly. not in a sort of soft skill\n[01:11:16] fuzzy way but as a in a quantifiable way\n[01:11:19] that impacts everything that matters to\n[01:11:21] them like as like a bottom line almost\n[01:11:24] as like an economic value to them and so\n[01:11:26] just having their eyes open to the fact\n[01:11:28] that like this is a skill and a skill\n[01:11:30] they need to get better at even if I\n[01:11:32] don't see them getting massively better\n[01:11:34] in the course of three months it means\n[01:11:36] that they are likely to get better at it\n[01:11:38] over the longer term because now they\n[01:11:39] know now they get it and now they know\n[01:11:41] that they aren't great at it yet. The\n[01:11:43] world of business looks entirely\n[01:11:45] different today than it did 15 years\n[01:11:46] ago. Back then, building a brand meant\n[01:11:48] having huge budgets, warehouses, office\n[01:11:50] space, and lots and lots of stuff. But\n[01:11:52] now, you can start a business with your\n[01:11:53] laptop, an idea, and the right tools.\n[01:11:55] And I would know more so than anybody\n[01:11:57] else because that's exactly what I did.\n[01:11:58] Shopify is one of our long-standing\n[01:12:00] sponsors on this show, and they're a\n[01:12:01] brand I often refer people to when\n[01:12:03] they're starting their businesses\n[01:12:05] because it's a tool that contains many\n[01:12:06] more tools within itself. And when\n[01:12:08] you're starting out, everything is\n[01:12:10] everywhere. It's messy, and it's\n[01:12:11] confusing. So having everything in the\n[01:12:12] same place is incredibly useful. Shopify\n[01:12:15] puts store design, payments, inventory,\n[01:12:17] shipping, and even AI tools all in one\n[01:12:20] place. And you can sell directly from\n[01:12:21] your website or on social media\n[01:12:23] essentially wherever your customers\n[01:12:25] spend their time. It's truly a brilliant\n[01:12:27] business tool. So if you want to give it\n[01:12:29] a go, head to shopify.com/bartlet\n[01:12:32] and sign up for your $1 per month trial\n[01:12:35] period. That's shopify.com/bartlet.\n[01:12:39] Are there anything else that you know we\n[01:12:41] talked about death by a thousand cuts as\n[01:12:42] it relates to being a 10 out of 10\n[01:12:44] conversationalist and like li like li\n[01:12:45] like li like li like li like li like li\n[01:12:45] like li like li like li like likeable\n[01:12:45] person are there any of these other\n[01:12:47] small things that we do which are\n[01:12:51] harming us but are tiny that most people\n[01:12:53] don't know they're doing\n[01:12:54] >> let's move to K as I'm moving along in\n[01:12:57] this framework um we're skipping L for\n[01:12:59] now which we would never skip L forever\n[01:13:01] K is for kindness um often we are all\n[01:13:05] taught this virtue of kindness when\n[01:13:07] we're children and spend the rest of our\n[01:13:10] lives sort of falling short of actually\n[01:13:12] doing it in practice.\n[01:13:14] >> I've forever been obsessed with this\n[01:13:15] idea of what are like people who are\n[01:13:18] actually kind, what are they thinking\n[01:13:20] about and how are they interacting with\n[01:13:21] other people? What kinds of choices are\n[01:13:23] they making? How do they talk to other\n[01:13:24] people? And so when you say death by a\n[01:13:26] thousand cuts, there are these sort of\n[01:13:29] mistakes that we make in the\n[01:13:30] respectfulness of our language that\n[01:13:33] undermine our actual kindness to other\n[01:13:35] people. making sure you use someone's\n[01:13:37] name. You gave this example and the one\n[01:13:39] out of 10 is like use the wrong name.\n[01:13:41] That is really meaningful. You need to\n[01:13:43] know people's names and use them\n[01:13:45] correctly and with appropriate\n[01:13:46] formality, right? Sometimes it's\n[01:13:48] wonderful to say like, \"Hey, honey.\" And\n[01:13:50] sometimes you need to say, \"Um, it's\n[01:13:52] nice to meet you, Dr. Brooks.\" Right?\n[01:13:53] Like it you need to be able to read\n[01:13:55] that. Um there is this paper um where\n[01:13:59] they studied conversations between\n[01:14:02] police officers and citizens in Oakland\n[01:14:05] actually close to here in normal traffic\n[01:14:07] stops. So when police pulled over\n[01:14:09] citizens and walked up to the car and\n[01:14:11] said um you were speeding, you know, and\n[01:14:13] they used body cam footage and got all\n[01:14:15] the transcripts from these interactions\n[01:14:17] and then measured the respectfulness of\n[01:14:19] the language that the police officers\n[01:14:21] were using.\n[01:14:22] There are some really, you know, not\n[01:14:25] surprising but terrible findings that\n[01:14:27] police officers were using less\n[01:14:29] respectful language towards black\n[01:14:31] citizens compared to white citizens. But\n[01:14:33] sort of more uh broadly speaking, the\n[01:14:36] interactions where they were using more\n[01:14:38] respectful language went better. There\n[01:14:40] were less conflicts. There were they w\n[01:14:42] they drive away without further\n[01:14:44] infractions. So the tiny choices we make\n[01:14:47] in our language and the language of\n[01:14:50] respect is varies along like hundreds of\n[01:14:54] features of language and it's a very\n[01:14:55] gradient concept but they have a real\n[01:14:58] impact on how these interactions go.\n[01:15:01] When we think about sort of like things\n[01:15:03] like systemic bi racial bias that's it\n[01:15:06] comes from that kind of stuff. That's\n[01:15:08] where it leaks out is in the language we\n[01:15:10] use with each other. So we can all learn\n[01:15:13] to use more respectful language.\n[01:15:15] >> Do you\n[01:15:17] think much about\n[01:15:20] how our emotional state is impacting our\n[01:15:23] ability to accomplish any of these\n[01:15:24] things? Cuz I think, you know, the days\n[01:15:25] where I'm least likely to be kind are\n[01:15:27] the days where I haven't slept.\n[01:15:29] >> Yeah.\n[01:15:29] >> I should probably be avoiding all\n[01:15:31] conversations that day.\n[01:15:32] >> It's really I think one of the biggest\n[01:15:34] things I've learned from all of this\n[01:15:35] work is that conversation is remarkably\n[01:15:38] effortful and it requires quite a bit of\n[01:15:40] energy. Even if you know how to be a\n[01:15:43] good conversationalist, often we don't\n[01:15:45] have the energy to actually do it. Oh, I\n[01:15:48] don't have the energy to brainstorm\n[01:15:50] topics. I don't have the energy to\n[01:15:51] continue asking follow-up questions. I'm\n[01:15:53] going to let my egoentrism take over and\n[01:15:55] boomer ask till the sun comes down goes\n[01:15:57] down.\n[01:15:58] >> Not like boomers.\n[01:15:59] >> Not boomers.\n[01:16:01] >> Difference of opinion here. [laughter]\n[01:16:03] >> I'm going to accidentally use\n[01:16:05] disrespectful language and not repair\n[01:16:07] that, not correct it. That's kind of\n[01:16:09] what keeps me up at night is that human\n[01:16:10] beings do have limitations. We are\n[01:16:12] limited in time. We're limited in\n[01:16:15] energy. Our brains are not\n[01:16:17] supercomputers. And so in practice,\n[01:16:20] people who are great communicators will\n[01:16:23] often fall short of their own hopes\n[01:16:25] because they don't have the energy to do\n[01:16:27] it.\n[01:16:27] >> I think Bnee Brown said to me that when\n[01:16:29] she comes home and she's out of energy,\n[01:16:31] she'll just say to her partner, \"Listen,\n[01:16:33] I'm on 10% today, so I can't deal with\n[01:16:34] this now.\" And what talk about\n[01:16:36] self-awareness, boy, if you can do that,\n[01:16:38] if you can say and you have sturdy\n[01:16:40] enough relationships at work and at home\n[01:16:42] that you could say, \"Dude, I'm like a\n[01:16:44] two out of 10. You got to cut me a break\n[01:16:45] today.\"\n[01:16:47] >> It would be tremendously helpful. It\n[01:16:49] requires quite a bit of self-awareness\n[01:16:51] to recognize that you're at a two out of\n[01:16:53] 10.\n[01:16:54] >> And a lot of grace from the people\n[01:16:57] around you, which means that you're\n[01:16:58] going to have to give them grace in\n[01:17:00] response at some point. Um, that's what\n[01:17:04] good relationships are.\n[01:17:06] >> And the L\n[01:17:07] >> L. Shall we put them in the correct\n[01:17:09] order? Yeah. V A L K.\n[01:17:11] >> L is for levity. So, we've talked a bit\n[01:17:13] about difficult conversations and how\n[01:17:15] they can so easily get overheated. When\n[01:17:17] you think about chats that go off the\n[01:17:20] rails, it's quite easy to think of\n[01:17:22] hostile conflict, difficult\n[01:17:24] conversations, because they're very\n[01:17:26] salient. They're very memorable. There's\n[01:17:28] might be shouting. There's going to be\n[01:17:30] hurt feelings, defensiveness. The more\n[01:17:32] common enemy of conversation is actually\n[01:17:35] boredom and disengagement. So yes, do we\n[01:17:38] get annoyed with each other? Absolutely.\n[01:17:41] But almost every conversation has stints\n[01:17:44] of disengagement where people aren't\n[01:17:46] interested. And so levity is humor and\n[01:17:50] warmth to help us avoid disinterest and\n[01:17:53] boredom.\n[01:17:55] And levity is important for sort of\n[01:17:58] happiness and engagement sake itself.\n[01:18:00] You know, it matters that we're enjoying\n[01:18:01] our time together, but maybe even more\n[01:18:04] profoundly,\n[01:18:06] if we are not leaning towards each other\n[01:18:09] and interested in what the other person\n[01:18:10] is saying, we can't achieve any of our\n[01:18:12] other goals. Good conversation requires\n[01:18:15] mutual engagement. So, if I'm bored and\n[01:18:17] my mind is wandering, which happens a\n[01:18:19] lot because I have attentional issues.\n[01:18:21] It happens to a lot of people a lot. Um,\n[01:18:24] the human mind wanders uh 25% of the\n[01:18:26] time during conversation. So, it's quite\n[01:18:29] common.\n[01:18:31] If your mind is wandering and you're not\n[01:18:33] engaged with each other, then you can't\n[01:18:34] do anything else either. Persuasion,\n[01:18:36] making decisions together,\n[01:18:37] brainstorming, connecting, um, none of\n[01:18:40] it. So, the L is very important because\n[01:18:43] it makes things fun and enjoyable, but\n[01:18:45] it's also important because we need to\n[01:18:46] stay here with each other and not\n[01:18:49] disengage.\n[01:18:50] >> What if you're not a warm person?\n[01:18:53] [laughter]\n[01:18:54] >> It's so fun.\n[01:18:55] >> I've been accused of being racist. Yeah.\n[01:18:56] Yeah. Yeah. People say to me, People say\n[01:18:58] to me a lot like you're very serious.\n[01:19:00] I'm like, really? I'm I think I come\n[01:19:02] across as serious sometimes.\n[01:19:03] >> I think you may come across as serious.\n[01:19:05] I would I think but you do come across\n[01:19:07] as very warm. And so that's an important\n[01:19:09] distinction.\n[01:19:10] >> You're using flattery. I've seen that\n[01:19:11] when you're confessing.\n[01:19:12] >> I'm not I'm giving I'm giving very\n[01:19:14] direct\n[01:19:15] flattery. [laughter]\n[01:19:16] Flattery here. High relational. I'm\n[01:19:18] going to you.\n[01:19:20] >> So there's levity is two parts. It's\n[01:19:22] humor and warmth. And I always start\n[01:19:25] this part of my class at Harvard by\n[01:19:27] saying to my students, if you're not\n[01:19:29] funny and you think you never will be,\n[01:19:32] it's okay [laughter]\n[01:19:34] because I don't think I'm going to be\n[01:19:35] the one to make you funny within the\n[01:19:37] span of two months if you are a deeply\n[01:19:39] serious unfunny person. Other people\n[01:19:42] believe that you can get funnier over\n[01:19:44] time. We can talk about that in a in a\n[01:19:45] moment. Um, what I do deeply believe is\n[01:19:48] that pe anyone can be more warm. And so\n[01:19:51] warmth moves include anything expressing\n[01:19:53] gratitude. I'm so grateful for your time\n[01:19:55] today. I'm so grateful for you engaging\n[01:19:57] with the content of my work, flattery,\n[01:20:01] giving compliments, just shifting\n[01:20:03] topics. So if you can get better at\n[01:20:04] sensing when people are getting bored\n[01:20:06] with a topic and getting more courageous\n[01:20:08] and assertive about switching more\n[01:20:10] frequently can be very, very helpful for\n[01:20:12] keeping the conversation sort of\n[01:20:14] bubbling along. Call backs.\n[01:20:17] Call backs are any reference back to\n[01:20:20] something that you've talked about\n[01:20:21] previously.\n[01:20:23] >> They're total magic.\n[01:20:25] It shows that you were listening to\n[01:20:27] someone earlier in the conversation,\n[01:20:29] maybe even earlier in your relationship,\n[01:20:31] like a month ago. If I can call back to\n[01:20:34] something we talked about, it shows I\n[01:20:36] heard you. I was thinking about what you\n[01:20:39] said. I was able to retain it in my mind\n[01:20:42] and I'm clever enough to reference back\n[01:20:44] to it now. And often it has this really\n[01:20:48] amazing quality where if I bring it up\n[01:20:49] again, it's funny because you're like,\n[01:20:52] \"Oh [ __ ] that's super clever.\"\n[01:20:54] >> Um, often pe a lot of people ask me,\n[01:20:56] \"How do we end conversations?\" Well, and\n[01:20:59] I have two pieces of advice there. I'm\n[01:21:01] going to bring this back to callbacks.\n[01:21:03] One is nobody knows when to end\n[01:21:05] conversations. It's the final topic\n[01:21:07] switch. It's the final coordination\n[01:21:09] choice. There's no way to know. There is\n[01:21:11] no right answer. Um, so it's better to\n[01:21:13] just end it. like be assertive, walk\n[01:21:15] away rather than hemming and hawing and\n[01:21:17] feeling bad and embarrassed about it.\n[01:21:19] The second piece of advice is that it's\n[01:21:21] a great time to try a call back. The\n[01:21:24] very last beat of the conversation, you\n[01:21:25] can say, \"And I hope you have a great\n[01:21:28] time with your girlfriend this weekend.\"\n[01:21:29] Right? Like whatever they they had\n[01:21:31] mentioned, \"Oh, I'm going to go we're\n[01:21:32] going to go to see this movie. I hope\n[01:21:34] you have a great time at the movie this\n[01:21:35] weekend.\"\n[01:21:36] >> Right? Showing that like, \"Oh, I heard\n[01:21:37] you 30 minutes ago when you told me this\n[01:21:39] thing.\" That can help to smooth the exit\n[01:21:42] ramp away.\n[01:21:44] I find it really useful to give people\n[01:21:45] my email address to end a conversation.\n[01:21:47] >> That's so interesting.\n[01:21:49] >> It just ends the conversation\n[01:21:51] immediately.\n[01:21:51] >> Yeah.\n[01:21:52] >> Someone will come up to me and say,\n[01:21:53] \"Hey, I've got this business idea I want\n[01:21:54] to pitch.\" And then they'll start\n[01:21:55] pitching.\n[01:21:56] >> And if I go, you know, send me here's my\n[01:21:57] email. The convers and I shake their\n[01:21:59] hand. The conversation ends immediately.\n[01:22:01] >> Do you feel it is dismissive?\n[01:22:03] >> Maybe.\n[01:22:05] However, in the context of like being in\n[01:22:08] the gym\n[01:22:09] >> and I'm like mid set\n[01:22:10] >> and someone comes over and says and I\n[01:22:12] go, \"Oh, here's my email. Here's if you\n[01:22:14] want to.\" It seems to end the\n[01:22:16] conversation and it feels to be like,\n[01:22:18] \"Please help me here.\"\n[01:22:20] >> What would be a better way to\n[01:22:22] >> I know. I think that's quite good\n[01:22:24] because it it could be perceived as a\n[01:22:26] little dismissive, but that person in\n[01:22:27] the gym is going to be like, \"Yeah, he\n[01:22:28] probably doesn't want to talk about my\n[01:22:29] business while he's, you know, lifting.\"\n[01:22:32] And you're opening the door to them.\n[01:22:34] You're saying I really would love to\n[01:22:36] receive an email from you. Um,\n[01:22:38] >> it is my real email as well. I'm not\n[01:22:39] giving out a fake one.\n[01:22:40] >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you should feel\n[01:22:42] like a jerk if you were giving out a\n[01:22:43] [laughter] fake.\n[01:22:44] >> I do read them.\n[01:22:45] >> Yeah, exactly. Um, depending on your\n[01:22:47] tolerance. I I also don't I think most\n[01:22:50] people wouldn't be excited about having\n[01:22:52] a deep conversation with a stranger at\n[01:22:54] the gym. And I think giving yourself\n[01:22:56] grace for that is also helpful. Like it\n[01:23:00] doesn't make you a bad person. I think\n[01:23:02] of an important thing that we take from\n[01:23:04] the book and this course is like talking\n[01:23:07] more is not always the answer.\n[01:23:09] >> Often it's not often it's important.\n[01:23:12] It's these low informational goals,\n[01:23:15] right? Like protecting your time,\n[01:23:17] protecting your mental health. Some\n[01:23:19] people, most people are under social.\n[01:23:21] Loneliness is a real problem. Um they\n[01:23:24] don't have enough friends. They're not\n[01:23:26] connected enough. But some people\n[01:23:28] probably are overconnected and your\n[01:23:30] social portfolio is too large and\n[01:23:32] there's too many people who need too\n[01:23:33] many things from you. And so thinking\n[01:23:35] carefully about what are your strategies\n[01:23:36] to sort of stave off over conversation\n[01:23:40] is quite worthwhile.\n[01:23:41] >> And is this introvert ambvert extrovert\n[01:23:44] stuff real?\n[01:23:45] >> It's a great question. People have\n[01:23:46] preferences about what makes them feel\n[01:23:49] connected to other people. Some people\n[01:23:52] would love to go to that party with a\n[01:23:54] hundred famous people. Tell me about\n[01:23:56] Zara and my team said that the thing she\n[01:23:57] wants to do on a Friday after a really\n[01:23:59] really really really really busy week is\n[01:24:01] she wants to go to a busy coffee shop\n[01:24:03] and be around loads of people. And I was\n[01:24:05] like what? She goes yeah it recharges\n[01:24:06] me. I'm like what are you like\n[01:24:07] psychopath?\n[01:24:08] >> And then there's me who after the same\n[01:24:10] week all I want to do is be in a dark\n[01:24:13] cold room.\n[01:24:15] >> Yeah.\n[01:24:15] >> On my own.\n[01:24:16] >> Yep. Totally. And both of those are fair\n[01:24:19] and fine. And knowing that about\n[01:24:21] yourself is really helpful. I don't know\n[01:24:24] as that relates to introversion and\n[01:24:25] extroversion as much as like where what\n[01:24:27] are your preferences for conversation.\n[01:24:30] It's both about how frequently who do\n[01:24:32] you want to be interacting with and what\n[01:24:33] topics are exciting. Is she going to\n[01:24:35] that coffee shop and talking about work\n[01:24:37] still or is she like no I can't wait to\n[01:24:39] talk about this weird other stuff to try\n[01:24:41] and get work off my mind.\n[01:24:42] >> But there's those people though in\n[01:24:43] society we all know them that are like\n[01:24:45] around people they just become like a\n[01:24:47] social butterfly.\n[01:24:48] >> Yeah.\n[01:24:49] >> They like to talk loads. They're really\n[01:24:51] engaged. They're energized by it.\n[01:24:52] >> Sure. And then there's us lot who are\n[01:24:55] just drained by that stuff. And I look\n[01:24:57] at these people and go I'm almost\n[01:24:58] jealous of them. I go I don't know how\n[01:24:59] you do that.\n[01:25:00] >> Sometimes\n[01:25:02] for sure whether you when you get\n[01:25:04] excited around lots of people can be a\n[01:25:06] huge advantage because we need to do\n[01:25:08] that sometimes. I actually think\n[01:25:11] possibly a better indicator of\n[01:25:12] introversion might be if you went into a\n[01:25:15] party or you were in a group\n[01:25:16] conversation and it was super awkward.\n[01:25:19] Nobody's talking. Do you feel like it's\n[01:25:21] your job to fix it?\n[01:25:24] Extroverts would be like, \"That's my\n[01:25:27] number one job in life.\n[01:25:29] I am the one. Don't worry. I'm here. I'm\n[01:25:33] here to save the awkwardness.\"\n[01:25:34] Introverts are often like, \"I'm going to\n[01:25:36] go loiter by the guacamole. It is this\n[01:25:39] is not my problem, and I don't want no\n[01:25:41] part of it.\"\n[01:25:42] >> Yeah.\n[01:25:42] >> So, sometimes it's not even about the\n[01:25:44] number of people that are around, but\n[01:25:45] how you're managing conversation. I just\n[01:25:48] put a new quiz on my website that helps\n[01:25:50] people figure out what are your\n[01:25:52] preferences. What are your natural\n[01:25:53] habits in tricky situations like that\n[01:25:56] and it gives you a sort of typo type?\n[01:25:59] What type are you? Do you tend to sort\n[01:26:00] of be avoidant? Do you tend to approach\n[01:26:02] and try and fix things? And then\n[01:26:05] strategies to use\n[01:26:06] >> and what do you see in terms of\n[01:26:07] percentages there and different?\n[01:26:08] >> We're going to find out. It's new. It's\n[01:26:09] new. Yeah. Yeah. We're just launching it\n[01:26:11] so I'm going to find out.\n[01:26:12] >> And does it have classifications in\n[01:26:14] terms of like\n[01:26:14] >> Yeah.\n[01:26:15] >> How many classifications?\n[01:26:16] >> Yeah. So it's only three types that you\n[01:26:18] could be um with this quiz and then sort\n[01:26:21] of like strategies that whatever your\n[01:26:22] type is this is going to help you in\n[01:26:24] terms of topics asking levity and\n[01:26:26] kindness\n[01:26:28] >> and what are the three categories one\n[01:26:29] one could be\n[01:26:30] >> so some one person could be sort of an\n[01:26:32] approach person who's like and I guess\n[01:26:34] probably correlated with extraversion\n[01:26:36] we'll find out um if it's awkward and\n[01:26:39] quiet you're the one that wants to jump\n[01:26:40] in and fix it there are pros and cons to\n[01:26:42] this too if you jump in And\n[01:26:46] you might say things or do things that\n[01:26:48] you don't actually aren't very proud of\n[01:26:50] >> and might lower your value.\n[01:26:51] >> Correct.\n[01:26:52] >> Yeah.\n[01:26:52] >> There are avoiders who are like, \"No,\n[01:26:54] thank you. I'm just going to I'm going\n[01:26:56] to stay here, but I'm going to not say\n[01:26:57] anything.\" And then there are people who\n[01:26:59] are like, \"I'm out of here. This party\n[01:27:00] sucks.\" Right? Like they're the exit the\n[01:27:02] exit people.\n[01:27:03] >> I feel attacked. [laughter]\n[01:27:05] >> No, but I I you know, that's interesting\n[01:27:07] because is it true that some people who\n[01:27:10] overtalk are less respected? Can you\n[01:27:13] overt talk? I I had this um this thought\n[01:27:16] many years ago based on again\n[01:27:18] observations I'd seen in boardrooms that\n[01:27:19] I'd been in and I'd see 12 of my team\n[01:27:22] members in a boardroom trying to come to\n[01:27:24] an idea for a campaign we were doing.\n[01:27:26] >> Yeah. And I noticed that one particular\n[01:27:28] person who I shame many years ago in our\n[01:27:31] New York office would talk so much and\n[01:27:34] too I would say too much to the extent\n[01:27:37] that the next time they spoke I could\n[01:27:40] see everybody in the room not paying\n[01:27:42] attention and discounting it before it\n[01:27:43] would come. So I came up with this idea.\n[01:27:45] I was like I think we all have a\n[01:27:46] contribution score. Yeah.\n[01:27:47] >> Like a credit score.\n[01:27:48] >> Love that. And it's based on how\n[01:27:51] thoughtful and valuable our previous\n[01:27:55] contributions have been.\n[01:27:57] >> Yeah.\n[01:27:57] >> And what I would see is with this\n[01:27:58] particular person, I shall call her\n[01:28:00] Katie,\n[01:28:00] >> the minute she spoke, um halfway through\n[01:28:02] her first sentence, I could see the\n[01:28:04] person sat next to her basically just\n[01:28:06] pre-rebutling it.\n[01:28:07] >> Yeah.\n[01:28:07] >> Like pre- dismissing it.\n[01:28:08] >> Yeah. And then on the contrary, there's\n[01:28:10] another particular person in our in our\n[01:28:12] Manchester office back in the day who\n[01:28:14] spoke so little that the minute they\n[01:28:17] spoke, it was like the room fell silent\n[01:28:19] and we all just swung our heads over to\n[01:28:20] them because you're like, \"Here comes a\n[01:28:22] really good take.\" So I thought\n[01:28:23] everybody has a contribution score\n[01:28:24] protect yours.\n[01:28:25] >> Yes. So group conversation is incredibly\n[01:28:28] complicated and one of the most\n[01:28:30] difficult things is so obvious is just\n[01:28:32] how do we share airtime? Uh there are\n[01:28:34] always going to be pe people who have\n[01:28:36] high power tend to take up more airtime\n[01:28:38] just naturally. It's something that high\n[01:28:41] power people need to fight against\n[01:28:42] because it's not productive\n[01:28:44] >> and it [clears throat] makes lower power\n[01:28:45] people feel like they're not welcome to\n[01:28:47] join. But then if you just look at\n[01:28:49] airtime balance the person who's\n[01:28:51] dominating the airtime that is not\n[01:28:52] productive, right? Like especially if\n[01:28:55] they're not the expert. Okay, that's\n[01:28:57] where things get problematic. You can\n[01:28:59] imagine a balance where okay there might\n[01:29:01] be a group where we are all dying to\n[01:29:03] hear we need to talk about aerospace\n[01:29:05] engineering and only one out of the 10\n[01:29:07] of us is an aerospace engineer. I want\n[01:29:10] to hear that guy talk for 45 minutes and\n[01:29:13] I want to learn everything I possibly\n[01:29:14] can\n[01:29:15] >> in that in [clears throat] that time.\n[01:29:16] The it becomes problematic when the\n[01:29:18] person dominating the airtime is not the\n[01:29:21] sole expert or maybe not an expert at\n[01:29:23] all.\n[01:29:25] There's another piece to this and I love\n[01:29:27] your idea of a contribution score where\n[01:29:30] talking is not the only way to add value\n[01:29:32] to a group. There are so many roles that\n[01:29:35] people play. There are timekeepers.\n[01:29:37] There's someone who's writing on the\n[01:29:38] board at the same time. Often the person\n[01:29:40] holding the pen ends up being the most\n[01:29:42] powerful person because they're making\n[01:29:43] diagrams and taking notes and they\n[01:29:46] decide what is worthy of being up on the\n[01:29:47] board. There are people who keep the\n[01:29:50] agenda. So, we're saying, \"Okay, here\n[01:29:51] are the topics we want to talk about.\n[01:29:53] here are the goals we came in with. We\n[01:29:55] want to make this decision. I'd like to\n[01:29:57] note that we haven't moved to the\n[01:29:58] pasture where we're going to make the\n[01:30:00] decision, right? The person who is sort\n[01:30:02] of facilitating the meeting becomes very\n[01:30:06] valuable. So there's all kinds of so\n[01:30:08] there's goals, there's roles in a group,\n[01:30:11] and then there's the soul the warmth of\n[01:30:14] it all. The other thing in line with\n[01:30:16] that that I've noticed from people with\n[01:30:18] a low contribution score in businesses\n[01:30:20] that I've built, whatever is they're bad\n[01:30:23] switchers\n[01:30:24] >> and it's it appears to be linked. What I\n[01:30:26] mean by a bad switcher is the group will\n[01:30:29] be talking about\n[01:30:30] >> I see. Yes. Yes. They're not they're\n[01:30:32] unwilling to go where the group wants to\n[01:30:33] go and they come keep coming back to\n[01:30:35] their thing or their like\n[01:30:38] >> Yeah. or something completely unrelated.\n[01:30:40] Yeah. As if they just needed to say\n[01:30:41] something. Yeah.\n[01:30:42] >> And it just it veers the group off the\n[01:30:45] subject. So, the group are talking\n[01:30:47] about, let's just say we're talking\n[01:30:49] about a campaign we're doing for\n[01:30:50] Starbucks and we're saying, \"Do you\n[01:30:52] think we should do uh an event in\n[01:30:54] Manhattan?\" And because it it almost\n[01:30:56] seems like they can't not talk. They'll\n[01:30:58] say,\n[01:31:01] \"I went on a holiday to Manhattan once\n[01:31:03] and it was um and it was uh it was voted\n[01:31:06] in the top 15 on the Forbes list of best\n[01:31:09] places to go.\" [laughter] And you just\n[01:31:10] go and you just look and go, \"What?\n[01:31:12] That's not what\n[01:31:12] >> What if that person, let me play Devil's\n[01:31:14] Adam for a second. What if they made a\n[01:31:17] joke about New York that was actually\n[01:31:19] funny? Slightly off topic,\n[01:31:21] >> great,\n[01:31:21] >> but actually funny.\" And then you get\n[01:31:22] right back into\n[01:31:23] >> right,\n[01:31:24] >> it's great. So it's not about in that\n[01:31:27] case it's not about bad switching. It's\n[01:31:29] about egoentrism. You're not reading the\n[01:31:32] room well. You're not serving the goals\n[01:31:34] of the group.\n[01:31:35] >> Yeah.\n[01:31:35] >> Right. Levity, moments of levity often\n[01:31:38] are about briefly switching to an\n[01:31:40] adjacent topic and then switching back.\n[01:31:43] >> Yeah.\n[01:31:43] >> And it's actually worth that side bar\n[01:31:47] because it's fun and everybody's like,\n[01:31:48] \"Oh, thank god we don't have to like\n[01:31:50] circle the drain on New York for a\n[01:31:52] million more minutes.\" Um the problem is\n[01:31:54] this guy is chiming in being like let me\n[01:31:56] tell you about the time I went to New\n[01:31:58] York.\n[01:31:59] >> Yeah. And and and the the collective are\n[01:32:00] trying to go in one direction. I\n[01:32:01] actually think this about this a lot in\n[01:32:03] the context of podcasting.\n[01:32:05] I would hate to have a co-host\n[01:32:07] >> and it would be very hard.\n[01:32:09] >> It would be so hard because in my mind\n[01:32:11] there's a particular direction I'm I'm\n[01:32:13] going in.\n[01:32:14] >> Yes.\n[01:32:14] >> And if they weren't aligned with the\n[01:32:16] direction I'm going in, it's rough. I\n[01:32:18] mean, you see it sometimes with on\n[01:32:19] podcast with a co-host where they're\n[01:32:21] going in a direction talking about\n[01:32:23] immigration\n[01:32:23] >> and they say like, \"But wait, wait,\n[01:32:24] wait, just one thing, one quick thing\n[01:32:26] before we move on.\" And then you go\n[01:32:27] back,\n[01:32:27] >> you go to a different direction, like,\n[01:32:28] \"Oh my gosh, oh no.\" And as a viewer,\n[01:32:30] you're like, \"Oh, you are making\n[01:32:31] progress towards the crux of the issue.\"\n[01:32:32] But this,\n[01:32:33] >> but I think that's what I'm talking\n[01:32:34] about. Like, how would you make sure\n[01:32:35] you're moving in the right direction as\n[01:32:37] the group?\n[01:32:38] >> Yes. And this is a great example because\n[01:32:40] we we often think of one-on-one\n[01:32:42] conversation is the same task as a\n[01:32:45] threeperson group. As soon as a third\n[01:32:47] person pulls up a chair, whether it's a\n[01:32:49] podcast co-host or a friend at a bar,\n[01:32:52] that task, it's a categorically\n[01:32:54] different task now because that third\n[01:32:57] person has the power to take you on\n[01:32:59] sidebars.\n[01:33:00] >> It's no longer being co-created\n[01:33:02] intimately between two minds. All of a\n[01:33:04] sudden, we get into this like\n[01:33:06] coordination kuruffle that\n[01:33:08] >> can be very, very frustrating. I suspect\n[01:33:10] that's part of why you don't like groups\n[01:33:12] actually is that you like so strongly\n[01:33:15] prefer one-on-one.\n[01:33:17] >> Yeah, I think that's true. I think\n[01:33:19] that's true. I prefer one-on-one. I\n[01:33:20] prefer the depth and\n[01:33:24] >> small talk feels like really\n[01:33:25] disingenuous sometimes.\n[01:33:26] >> Can I push you? Do you think it's about\n[01:33:29] control?\n[01:33:30] Because imagine you had a co-host. The\n[01:33:33] problem that you the reason you'd feel\n[01:33:34] so frustrated with that, yes, it's about\n[01:33:36] the flow of the conversation getting to\n[01:33:38] a magical moment. It's also like you had\n[01:33:41] to like relinquish control to someone\n[01:33:42] else in that moment.\n[01:33:44] >> It's interesting because um I was with a\n[01:33:46] colleague of mine the other day and we\n[01:33:49] were interviewing some people.\n[01:33:51] >> Mhm.\n[01:33:51] >> So we just say we were interviewing\n[01:33:52] three people.\n[01:33:53] >> Yeah.\n[01:33:54] >> The first interview I told her to lead\n[01:33:56] the interview and I enjoyed the\n[01:33:58] interview because I could watch her go\n[01:34:00] in her direction. Felt very like a\n[01:34:02] straight line. The second interview I\n[01:34:05] didn't say anything and what happened is\n[01:34:06] I started asking them a question. Now\n[01:34:08] I'm sat there asking this guy a question\n[01:34:10] because I'm trying to figure out this\n[01:34:11] particular answer. So I'm kind of like\n[01:34:13] circling this issue, not kind of giving\n[01:34:14] it away and I'm getting one step closer\n[01:34:16] and another step closer and then my\n[01:34:19] colleague comes in and asks a completely\n[01:34:20] different QUESTION\n[01:34:21] >> AND YOU'RE LIKE\n[01:34:22] >> AND I'M LIKE, \"OH NO, I WAS LIKE SO\n[01:34:24] CLOSE TO figuring out this thing about\n[01:34:26] them that I suspect is a red flag.\" So\n[01:34:28] like, and then she um came and asked the\n[01:34:30] question and then I'm like, \"Oh my god,\n[01:34:32] no. Now I have to go right back to this\n[01:34:34] completely different subject and stop\n[01:34:35] >> and you're never going to get your\n[01:34:36] answer.\" So anyway, afterwards I had a\n[01:34:38] conversation with her and I said,\n[01:34:39] \"Listen, when we do interviews, I think\n[01:34:40] we need to clarify who's leading.\"\n[01:34:42] >> That's right.\n[01:34:42] >> I'll sit and listen. When you do it,\n[01:34:44] then when I do it, you sit, you know?\n[01:34:45] Yep.\n[01:34:46] >> And so I think that's part of it.\n[01:34:48] >> That's part of the roles thing I was\n[01:34:50] talking about before too, right? Like\n[01:34:51] there's this roles of like you're\n[01:34:52] scribing, you're keeping time or\n[01:34:54] whatever, but also being having clarity\n[01:34:57] about like who's the topic leader here.\n[01:34:59] >> Yeah.\n[01:34:59] >> And clarity, especially in a group of\n[01:35:01] three, can be incredibly helpful. Uh and\n[01:35:03] lack of it is chaotic.\n[01:35:05] >> A nightmare.\n[01:35:06] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:35:08] >> What is the most important thing we\n[01:35:09] haven't talked about as it relates to\n[01:35:10] likability and having great\n[01:35:11] conversations and dislikability if\n[01:35:13] that's a word?\n[01:35:15] >> I want to distance ourselves from\n[01:35:16] likability. I think likability is one\n[01:35:18] very narrow goal of good conversation.\n[01:35:21] >> What other things do people care about?\n[01:35:23] Do you know why I use certain words?\n[01:35:25] >> Tell me.\n[01:35:26] >> Is because the audience have told me.\n[01:35:28] >> Should I tell you what they care about?\n[01:35:29] >> Please.\n[01:35:30] >> They care about dealing with\n[01:35:31] narcissists.\n[01:35:31] >> Good. They care about um how to have\n[01:35:33] different\n[01:35:34] >> because they struggle with it,\n[01:35:36] >> I guess. So, yeah.\n[01:35:37] >> Yeah. It's an interesting label. It's\n[01:35:39] very accusatory of other people.\n[01:35:41] >> Yeah.\n[01:35:42] >> Because I think everybody thinks the\n[01:35:44] person they disagree with is a\n[01:35:44] narcissist. It's like a nice way to like\n[01:35:46] just\n[01:35:47] >> So, a reframe of it is they struggle\n[01:35:49] with disagreement.\n[01:35:51] >> Yeah.\n[01:35:51] >> Okay.\n[01:35:52] >> The other thing is they care a lot about\n[01:35:54] um difficult conversations. It's the\n[01:35:57] bane of their life. They struggle with\n[01:35:58] them. They avoid them. They think if\n[01:35:59] they could only get good at it, then\n[01:36:00] they'd be everything they want to be.\n[01:36:02] >> Yeah.\n[01:36:02] >> They care about being liked.\n[01:36:04] >> Y\n[01:36:05] >> um they care about avoiding things that\n[01:36:07] make them disliked that they're unaware\n[01:36:09] of that they're doing.\n[01:36:11] >> I would say\n[01:36:14] and I I guess the the fifth one is they\n[01:36:16] they care a lot about persuasion\n[01:36:18] remarkably. And Julian Treasure, who did\n[01:36:20] that TED talk about speaking told me\n[01:36:22] this, people don't really care much\n[01:36:24] about listening.\n[01:36:25] >> And he told me he did two\n[01:36:26] >> because they don't know. It's funny.\n[01:36:28] It's it's so interesting to hear you say\n[01:36:31] those things. To me, those are all very\n[01:36:34] related to each other and revealing that\n[01:36:37] people don't have great instincts about\n[01:36:40] their strengths and weaknesses and\n[01:36:42] what's hard and easy about conversation.\n[01:36:45] persuasion, difficult conversations,\n[01:36:48] thinking other people are narcissists,\n[01:36:51] um, and being liked. They're all related\n[01:36:55] to mismanaging conflict and disagreement\n[01:36:59] and and have struggling to manage\n[01:37:01] moments of difficulty. Well, the social\n[01:37:05] landscape of all conversation is so much\n[01:37:08] broader than people realize, I think,\n[01:37:11] because there were so narrowly focused\n[01:37:13] on these very noticeable,\n[01:37:16] memorable, salient moments\n[01:37:19] of disagreement that we're like, \"Oh\n[01:37:21] [ __ ] that's hard.\" And we got mad and\n[01:37:22] it ruined and we broke up.\n[01:37:24] >> Of course,\n[01:37:25] >> but you're also super boring like 80% of\n[01:37:28] the time. [laughter]\n[01:37:30] And also, you're you're not really\n[01:37:32] listening to other people. You're\n[01:37:33] missing so many opportunities to\n[01:37:35] actually learn from people because\n[01:37:37] you're not listening. You're not asking\n[01:37:38] enough follow-up questions. You're not\n[01:37:41] asking enough questions at all. You're\n[01:37:43] talk spending too much time talking\n[01:37:44] about yourself.\n[01:37:45] >> Like, obviously, this is what people\n[01:37:47] like because\n[01:37:49] >> the thing that I will remember the most\n[01:37:51] is the conflict, the issue, the problem,\n[01:37:53] the emotional situation. Yeah.\n[01:37:54] >> People don't think they're boring. Like\n[01:37:56] on\n[01:37:57] >> it's it's a it's hard to it's such a\n[01:37:59] it's a much harder thing to notice.\n[01:38:01] >> Yeah.\n[01:38:02] >> And it's a much harder thing to get\n[01:38:03] feedback about because no one's going to\n[01:38:05] be like, \"Hey, bro, you're boring.\"\n[01:38:07] >> Yeah. And if the things I'm interested\n[01:38:09] in, by way of me being interested, I\n[01:38:11] think they're interesting.\n[01:38:12] >> Yeah.\n[01:38:12] >> So, I think that I'm just making stuff\n[01:38:15] up Pokémon. I think that's the most\n[01:38:16] important interesting thing in the\n[01:38:17] world.\n[01:38:17] >> And let me now tell you everything I\n[01:38:19] know about Pokémon. Yeah.\n[01:38:21] >> It's like this. It's like this\n[01:38:22] misunderstanding of what it the purpose\n[01:38:24] of conversation is not to say things we\n[01:38:27] know at other people.\n[01:38:29] >> It's about finding things we're both\n[01:38:31] interested in and then learning\n[01:38:32] everything that you know about that.\n[01:38:34] Like now I'm just going to like take a\n[01:38:37] journey through your brain of everything\n[01:38:39] that you think and feel about this thing\n[01:38:40] that we're both interested in. And on\n[01:38:42] that journey we might land in this\n[01:38:44] magical place where I'm learning stuff\n[01:38:46] from you. You find me quite charming.\n[01:38:48] We're laughing together and we feel seen\n[01:38:50] and known and understood. But it's\n[01:38:53] definitely not going to be me telling\n[01:38:54] you about Pokemon if you're deeply\n[01:38:56] disinterested in it.\n[01:38:57] >> And there's just the the difference\n[01:38:58] between being interesting and\n[01:39:00] interested. We think that\n[01:39:01] >> Yes.\n[01:39:02] >> Like I think that the game of being\n[01:39:04] interesting is to show you\n[01:39:05] >> life is not about walking through life\n[01:39:08] giving like mini speeches or like mini\n[01:39:10] TED talks, right? It's about convers\n[01:39:14] conversation is interactive. It's\n[01:39:15] co-created with two independent minds.\n[01:39:19] Entrepreneurs make this mistake a lot\n[01:39:20] too. They they may be driven by, you\n[01:39:24] know, Dragon's Den and Shark Tank. You\n[01:39:26] feel like it's not your fault. You feel\n[01:39:28] like you need to stand up there and like\n[01:39:31] pitch your idea and in order to be\n[01:39:33] successful, you give the most compelling\n[01:39:35] public speech about it. Most\n[01:39:38] entrepreneurs or business owners\n[01:39:40] actually are talking to investors and\n[01:39:42] colleagues and potential partner\n[01:39:43] strategic partners in conversation. And\n[01:39:46] so before you get to the point where\n[01:39:48] you're like, \"Let me tell you about my\n[01:39:49] amazing company, you need to ask them a\n[01:39:51] million questions and get to know them\n[01:39:54] and understand what their pain points\n[01:39:56] are and how many kids they have and what\n[01:39:58] they actually care about. So if you're\n[01:40:00] lucky, the thing that and product or\n[01:40:02] service you have actually fills that\n[01:40:04] need and be like, \"Guess what? I have\n[01:40:05] this amazing thing for you. Wouldn't you\n[01:40:07] love to invest in it?\n[01:40:10] >> Andrew Bustamante said something to me\n[01:40:11] about this. He said um he's a spy for\n[01:40:13] the CIA for about 10 years and he said\n[01:40:16] one of the things you you have to train\n[01:40:17] yourself to understand as a spy is that\n[01:40:20] there's a difference between your\n[01:40:22] perspective which is like what I see\n[01:40:24] right now. Yes. And in my perspective I\n[01:40:26] see a mirror over there and there's an\n[01:40:27] award and I see some things behind you.\n[01:40:28] I see two cameras over your shoulder. I\n[01:40:30] see that. There's a wooden beam over\n[01:40:31] there behind you by the way. And there's\n[01:40:33] like some green tape above there. And\n[01:40:35] then there's your perception. Yes.\n[01:40:37] >> Your perception is all this [ __ ] Like I\n[01:40:38] couldn't see any of this stuff\n[01:40:40] >> behind me.\n[01:40:40] >> That's right.\n[01:40:41] >> And he said like as a spy, they train\n[01:40:43] you to sit in the other person's\n[01:40:45] perception because if you can't do that,\n[01:40:47] you're never going to be able to\n[01:40:47] persuade them. Like you have to realize\n[01:40:49] that actually you sat in front of me\n[01:40:51] have a different brain.\n[01:40:52] >> And the only I can guess what's in your\n[01:40:55] brain. I can guess. Maybe there's a\n[01:40:57] mirror behind me. Maybe there's art.\n[01:40:58] Maybe there's just a wall. I can guess\n[01:41:01] based on what I see, based on what I've\n[01:41:03] experienced. We're in a room. So, I'm\n[01:41:05] going to guess there's some sort of wall\n[01:41:06] behind me and not out into the street.\n[01:41:09] But we're really bad at guessing. Tons\n[01:41:12] of psychological research suggests that\n[01:41:13] human beings are terrible at using our\n[01:41:16] own experiences to guess other people's\n[01:41:18] perceptual realities. Guess your\n[01:41:20] perspective. So, instead of guessing, I\n[01:41:23] need to ask you, hey, Stephen, what do\n[01:41:26] you see behind me? I need to ask you\n[01:41:28] directly, how does that make you feel?\n[01:41:30] Why do you think it was built that way?\n[01:41:32] What do you feel when you're sitting\n[01:41:33] here? Why do you think it's\n[01:41:34] asymmetrical? Why are why do I see books\n[01:41:36] but you don't? The only way to truly\n[01:41:38] understand another person's mind is to\n[01:41:40] ask them and to talk about it.\n[01:41:42] >> I asked my assistant Sophie to find me a\n[01:41:44] reliable security system for my new\n[01:41:46] place in LA. What she discovered is that\n[01:41:48] most available options have the same\n[01:41:49] issue. They're reactive and only take\n[01:41:52] action after someone has broken into\n[01:41:54] your house. Simply Safe, who sponsors\n[01:41:56] this show, has a completely different\n[01:41:57] approach. If someone's lurking near your\n[01:41:59] home or office, their AI powered cameras\n[01:42:02] detect them. Then human agents who act\n[01:42:04] like a remote security guard take\n[01:42:06] action, speaking directly to the\n[01:42:08] intruder, letting them know they're\n[01:42:09] being watched on camera and if\n[01:42:11] necessary, triggering a siren or\n[01:42:13] spotlight to scare them off. Or they can\n[01:42:15] call 911 for police dispatch. This\n[01:42:17] immediate response is why I went with\n[01:42:19] Simply Safe. No one else approaches\n[01:42:21] security in the same way. They have no\n[01:42:23] long-term contracts or hidden fees, so\n[01:42:25] you can cancel at any time. They also\n[01:42:28] have a 60-day money back guarantee. My\n[01:42:30] audience can save 50% on a simplysafe\n[01:42:33] home security system at\n[01:42:34] simplysafe.com/doac.\n[01:42:37] That is simplysafe.com/doac.\n[01:42:40] There's no safe like a simplysafe. You\n[01:42:42] know, every once in a while you come\n[01:42:43] across a product that has such a huge\n[01:42:46] impact on your life that you'd probably\n[01:42:48] describe as a gamecher. And I would say\n[01:42:52] for about 35 to 40% of my team, they\n[01:42:56] would currently describe this product\n[01:42:58] that I have in front of me called Ketone\n[01:43:00] IQ, which you can get at ketone.com\n[01:43:03] as a game changer. But the reason I\n[01:43:04] became a co-owner of this company and\n[01:43:06] the reason why they they now are a\n[01:43:07] sponsor of this podcast is because one\n[01:43:10] day when I came to work, there was a box\n[01:43:11] of this stuff sat on my desk. I had no\n[01:43:12] idea what it was. Lily in my team says\n[01:43:15] that this company have been in touch. So\n[01:43:16] I went upstairs, tried it, and quite\n[01:43:19] frankly, the rest is history. in terms\n[01:43:20] of my focus, my energy levels, how I\n[01:43:23] feel, how I work, how productive I am.\n[01:43:26] Game changer. So, if you want to give it\n[01:43:27] a try, visit ketone.com/stephven\n[01:43:29] for 30% off. You'll also get a free gift\n[01:43:32] with your second shipment. And now you\n[01:43:34] can find Ketone IQ at Target stores\n[01:43:36] across the United States, where your\n[01:43:38] first shot is completely free of charge.\n[01:43:42] So when I go into a business meeting or\n[01:43:44] I'm trying to persuade someone to I\n[01:43:46] don't know join our company whatever at\n[01:43:49] the beginning of that conversation\n[01:43:51] are there key questions that I should be\n[01:43:53] using to understand their ideology like\n[01:43:57] understand the the hero's journey that\n[01:43:59] they they have in their head of them\n[01:44:01] >> you should ask more and listen to their\n[01:44:04] answers and then ask the next question.\n[01:44:06] >> What kind of questions?\n[01:44:07] >> A good one that I like to start with is\n[01:44:08] what are you excited about lately?\n[01:44:10] >> Okay.\n[01:44:11] >> Right. It's [clears throat] very\n[01:44:11] revealing of what there's is top of\n[01:44:13] mind. You asked me that question today.\n[01:44:15] Loved it.\n[01:44:16] >> It's it also implies that you knew what\n[01:44:19] they were excited about previously. So,\n[01:44:21] it can help you kind of revisit that a\n[01:44:23] bit over time. Whatever there has an\n[01:44:26] answer to that question, even if they're\n[01:44:28] terribly depressed, they're excited\n[01:44:30] about something. Maybe the prospect of\n[01:44:32] making a friend.\n[01:44:33] >> Um, and anything that someone is excited\n[01:44:36] about means you can stay on that topic\n[01:44:37] and ask more. Oh, well, what what could\n[01:44:39] I do to help you do that? Um, right?\n[01:44:42] Like we we can just carried carry on\n[01:44:45] down that path.\n[01:44:45] >> When I asked you that question three\n[01:44:47] hours ago, you said two things. You said\n[01:44:48] about putting curriculum into schools,\n[01:44:51] but you also talked about men and their\n[01:44:53] conversations. And you said you had done\n[01:44:55] a study recently. Yeah.\n[01:44:56] >> About men. This is me remembering what\n[01:44:58] you said. This is back.\n[01:45:00] >> Loving it. Loving it.\n[01:45:01] >> Thank you for that. But men and their\n[01:45:03] conversations. You said you've done an\n[01:45:04] interesting study recently which I can't\n[01:45:05] go into the details about, but it was\n[01:45:07] revealing about male friendship.\n[01:45:09] >> Yes.\n[01:45:10] >> Are men bad at communication? If so, why\n[01:45:12] are we bad at communication?\n[01:45:13] >> Conversation's hard. When you look under\n[01:45:15] the hood, it's looks more like a train\n[01:45:17] wreck.\n[01:45:18] >> You're being diplomatic\n[01:45:19] >> than I will be. I'll be less diplomatic\n[01:45:20] in a moment. Um, it looks more like a\n[01:45:22] train wreck than a sort of tidy script\n[01:45:24] that you would see on a TV show. It's\n[01:45:27] messy. We make mistakes. We have to\n[01:45:28] repair it. We need to check our\n[01:45:31] understanding. We need to make\n[01:45:32] apologies. constantly. So, perfection is\n[01:45:35] not the goal for anyone in conversation.\n[01:45:38] When you look at gender differences,\n[01:45:41] there are real gender differences. Um,\n[01:45:43] we know that in friendship, women tend\n[01:45:46] to actually face each other and talk to\n[01:45:47] each other. Men tend to do activities,\n[01:45:49] right? Shouldertoshoulder. We're\n[01:45:50] fishing, we're playing basketball, we're\n[01:45:53] in fantasy sports on our computers.\n[01:45:56] This project that I did recently, I\n[01:45:58] always spend lots of time analyzing\n[01:46:00] transcripts at very large scale. This\n[01:46:03] project though, I was observing\n[01:46:05] conversations live. And for whatever\n[01:46:07] reason, that was much more visceral than\n[01:46:09] what I usually do as a scientist. And it\n[01:46:11] was all men meeting other men for the\n[01:46:14] first time and sort of trying to forge\n[01:46:16] friendships. And what was so hard to\n[01:46:19] watch is that they don't they really\n[01:46:23] struggled with vulnerability.\n[01:46:25] Vulnerability is such a key component of\n[01:46:27] friendship. We friendship\n[01:46:29] [clears throat] experts say you need\n[01:46:30] consistency. So interacting\n[01:46:33] repeatedly, positivity, having fun\n[01:46:36] together, but maybe most importantly\n[01:46:38] vulnerability. Like sharing not only\n[01:46:40] your feelings with each other, but like\n[01:46:41] what are you struggling with? What are\n[01:46:43] your what are your hopes and dreams?\n[01:46:44] What are your goals? What do you want to\n[01:46:45] get out of this? It was so maddening to\n[01:46:48] watch these men have hundreds of\n[01:46:52] conversations and like none of them\n[01:46:55] asked those questions or talked about\n[01:46:56] those things with each other. As a\n[01:46:59] woman, it was it was almost shocking\n[01:47:01] because it's sort of like what women\n[01:47:03] would probably talk about within the\n[01:47:05] first three minutes of the conversation.\n[01:47:08] And I couldn't believe I was like, \"Wow,\n[01:47:10] this is really this really seems like a\n[01:47:12] massive difference.\" And I worry that\n[01:47:15] large scale the leap from being\n[01:47:19] basketball buddies or fantasy sports\n[01:47:21] buddies into vulnerable conversation\n[01:47:24] feels so scary and risky that men are\n[01:47:29] unable to make the leap. And that's a\n[01:47:31] huge part of what's holding back men\n[01:47:33] from having meaningful friendships. And\n[01:47:36] we know that loneliness is so much worse\n[01:47:38] for men than for women.\n[01:47:39] >> And they have way less friends.\n[01:47:41] >> Yes. Yes. I Ridiculous proportion of men\n[01:47:45] say report having zero close friends.\n[01:47:48] 40% potentially.\n[01:47:51] >> Wow.\n[01:47:53] >> It's quite troubling. And I think that I\n[01:47:55] think their conversation skills and\n[01:47:57] courage. Listen, everything that we've\n[01:48:00] talked about, choosing good topics,\n[01:48:02] shifting to new topics when they get\n[01:48:03] boring, asking good questions, asking\n[01:48:05] follow-up questions, finding moments of\n[01:48:07] levity, um apologizing, listening, all\n[01:48:10] of these things take a surprising amount\n[01:48:12] of courage and confidence.\n[01:48:16] And it feels like this thing for men who\n[01:48:18] have been socialized to believe that\n[01:48:20] vulnerability is a sign of weakness. It\n[01:48:23] feels like it's like almost takes too\n[01:48:25] much courage for them to make that leap\n[01:48:28] in their relationships. And it's quite\n[01:48:31] problematic.\n[01:48:32] >> Men are 400% more likely to say they\n[01:48:34] have no one to turn to in a time of\n[01:48:36] crisis. Um half of men say they are\n[01:48:38] unsatisfied with their friendships.\n[01:48:40] Men's number of close friends has\n[01:48:42] dropped by 30 to 40% since 1990.\n[01:48:47] >> Men come to rely on their in\n[01:48:49] heterosexual relationships come to rely\n[01:48:50] on their partner for emotional\n[01:48:52] fulfillment and support. Women do not.\n[01:48:55] So when you know a woman a female spouse\n[01:48:58] dies, men have to remarry to fill that\n[01:49:00] void. They don't have that friendship.\n[01:49:02] When a\n[01:49:04] husband dies, the woman has her friends\n[01:49:07] to support her. So, how can I how can I\n[01:49:09] make more friends as a man?\n[01:49:10] >> I think it's really one conversation at\n[01:49:13] a time. The power you have is sign as an\n[01:49:16] individual is signaling to other men,\n[01:49:18] hey, let's take this courageous leap.\n[01:49:20] Like, here's a question you can ask.\n[01:49:22] What have you been struggling with\n[01:49:23] recently?\n[01:49:25] What do you hope to achieve? But what\n[01:49:27] have you been what kind of thing have\n[01:49:28] you been thinking about that you haven't\n[01:49:30] shared with anyone before?\n[01:49:31] >> And in the study you did, what kind Give\n[01:49:33] me a flavor of how the conversation\n[01:49:35] sounded. Hey man, you want to get Oh,\n[01:49:37] this this hot dog is gross.\n[01:49:40] Yeah, it's really gross.\n[01:49:43] Yeah, this is Yeah, I don't like the\n[01:49:45] food. [laughter]\n[01:49:48] I'm going to go take a nap. It's like\n[01:49:51] narrating what's happening around you.\n[01:49:54] Sometimes they'd be like, \"Where are you\n[01:49:56] from?\"\n[01:49:58] Or,\n[01:49:59] >> and then that would turn into a\n[01:50:00] narration.\n[01:50:01] >> Yeah.\n[01:50:01] >> Oh, I love Chicago. It has that team.\n[01:50:05] Uh, I hate the Chicago Bears. Uh, oh\n[01:50:08] yeah, I remember when so and so played\n[01:50:10] there. Then you devolve into the sports\n[01:50:11] talk, which can be important, but you\n[01:50:14] can you move a step beyond and be like,\n[01:50:17] did you ever feel vulnerable when you\n[01:50:20] played football in high school? Right?\n[01:50:21] Like or like what did you struggle with\n[01:50:23] in terms of sports? Why didn't you play\n[01:50:26] college sports? I whatever wherever the\n[01:50:28] whatever the topic is, you can take that\n[01:50:30] next step to make it actually personal\n[01:50:34] and vulnerable and interesting so that\n[01:50:36] you walk away one step closer to having\n[01:50:39] an actual friend and not just someone\n[01:50:41] you say things you know to.\n[01:50:45] >> I did a talk in Canary War for a couple\n[01:50:48] of week couple of maybe a year ago and a\n[01:50:50] kid stood up in the front row. You got\n[01:50:52] to bear in mind there's 500 young I say\n[01:50:54] young I mean probably 21. They're all\n[01:50:56] working in this part of London called\n[01:50:57] Canary Wolf where you kind of your first\n[01:50:59] job after university. 500 people in this\n[01:51:01] room. Kid stands up front row says, \"Hi,\n[01:51:04] my question is um I\n[01:51:08] want to know how to make friends.\"\n[01:51:09] >> Mhm.\n[01:51:10] >> And it it was shocking to me because I\n[01:51:12] could see 499 of his peers stood next to\n[01:51:14] him.\n[01:51:15] >> Mhm.\n[01:51:15] >> But he had the guts to stand up in front\n[01:51:16] of all these people and say, \"Hi,\n[01:51:18] Stephen. My question is, how do you make\n[01:51:20] friends?\"\n[01:51:20] >> It's a fabulous question, isn't it? If\n[01:51:22] he had asked you that question, he might\n[01:51:25] be listening now.\n[01:51:26] >> Hello, friend. Starts with hello. And\n[01:51:30] the number of times that I have run\n[01:51:33] conversation exercises as part of my\n[01:51:35] class and the students at the end of\n[01:51:37] that very first session say this is the\n[01:51:39] first time I've turned to the person\n[01:51:40] next to me and actually talked to them.\n[01:51:43] It's like every time I do that first\n[01:51:45] session, thank you. Thank you for the\n[01:51:47] opportunity to turn the re giving us a\n[01:51:49] reason to turn to each other and\n[01:51:50] actually talk get to know my classmates.\n[01:51:53] [clears throat]\n[01:51:54] >> Even that takes tremendous courage\n[01:51:56] especially if there are norms of not\n[01:51:58] doing of coming in sitting down at a\n[01:52:00] desk or in an auditorium and being on\n[01:52:02] your phone. So literally turning to\n[01:52:04] someone next to you and saying like hey\n[01:52:06] I'm Allison. What's your name? Where are\n[01:52:07] you from? Starting right.\n[01:52:09] >> God we don't do that in the UK. It's\n[01:52:11] like creepy behavior.\n[01:52:12] >> It's okay. And that's you do need to\n[01:52:13] read the room, right? like it's maybe\n[01:52:15] not appropriate in all situ. It's a it\n[01:52:17] can be a shame. It depends on the norms.\n[01:52:19] >> Once you are engaged with people, it's\n[01:52:21] all of the talk things. What topics will\n[01:52:24] they actually find helpful to them? Are\n[01:52:26] you asking questions? Are you listening\n[01:52:28] and asking follow-up questions? Are you\n[01:52:31] moving beyond just trading things, you\n[01:52:33] know?\n[01:52:35] Are you learning about each other in a\n[01:52:38] way that feels revealing? That's where\n[01:52:41] real relationships come from. What is um\n[01:52:43] what are these here?\n[01:52:44] >> Yeah, let's find out.\n[01:52:46] >> This list of questions here.\n[01:52:47] >> Oh, this is an exercise that I do. This\n[01:52:50] is based on a very well-known exercise\n[01:52:52] called 36 questions to fall in love.\n[01:52:54] >> Oh, I heard about that.\n[01:52:55] >> Yeah, Arthur Aaron. It was it was in the\n[01:52:56] New York Times many years ago. It's\n[01:52:58] based on some academic research. This is\n[01:53:00] 10 a subset of 10 of those 36 questions.\n[01:53:03] An exercise I do in my class called 10\n[01:53:06] questions to fall in like instead of\n[01:53:08] love.\n[01:53:09] >> So, if I ask someone those 10 questions,\n[01:53:10] they're going to like me.\n[01:53:11] >> Probably. Yeah, more than if you didn't\n[01:53:14] ask the questions. Um, what you want to\n[01:53:16] do is you actually go back and forth and\n[01:53:18] ask each other these questions. So, the\n[01:53:21] first one is, what are you excited about\n[01:53:22] lately? Next is, what is something\n[01:53:24] you're good at but don't like doing?\n[01:53:25] What's something you're bad at but love\n[01:53:27] to do? Is there something you'd like to\n[01:53:28] learn more about? Is there something\n[01:53:30] you'd like to learn how to do? What can\n[01:53:32] we celebrate about you? Has someone made\n[01:53:34] you laugh recently? What's something\n[01:53:35] cute your kid, friend, pet, or partner\n[01:53:37] has been doing? Did you grow up in a\n[01:53:39] city? And have you fallen in love with\n[01:53:41] any new music, books, movies, shows\n[01:53:43] lately? It's just 10 questions that are\n[01:53:45] of this flavor that many people, but I\n[01:53:49] suspect lots of men don't ask.\n[01:53:52] >> That are a great starting point. It's\n[01:53:55] just the first turn, right? You have to\n[01:53:57] actually listen to what the person says\n[01:53:58] and ask follow-up questions to really\n[01:54:00] deepen the conversation and move up that\n[01:54:02] topic pyramid. But these are good\n[01:54:05] questions. You could prep just one or\n[01:54:08] two of them. You could carry two of them\n[01:54:10] in your back pocket all the time as\n[01:54:12] go-to topics for people. So, when this\n[01:54:15] opportunity arises, you could ask them.\n[01:54:18] I like the one, \"What are you excited\n[01:54:19] about lately?\" That's my go-to with a\n[01:54:22] lot of people. Also, like, have you are\n[01:54:24] you obsessed with any shows right now?\n[01:54:25] Is pretty a pretty good one, too. But\n[01:54:27] the key is not just asking that\n[01:54:29] question, but actually asking follow-up\n[01:54:31] questions about like why do you connect\n[01:54:32] with that show? What do you see in the\n[01:54:33] main character? Do you see anything from\n[01:54:35] the main character that you see in\n[01:54:36] yourself? you know, you got to get more\n[01:54:39] you got to get deeper into it. The\n[01:54:42] original research with the 36 questions\n[01:54:43] to fall in love suggests that going\n[01:54:45] through these 36 questions\n[01:54:47] makes you like each other a lot. Um, and\n[01:54:50] certainly these 10 questions would help\n[01:54:52] you start. If you need the excuse, I\n[01:54:55] would love for your listeners to blame\n[01:54:57] me. If you're feeling if they feel\n[01:55:00] nervous to ask questions like this,\n[01:55:02] especially boys or men, say like, \"I saw\n[01:55:05] this crazy lady on Diary of a CEO and\n[01:55:08] she said I should try asking this\n[01:55:09] question, so I'm going to try.\" I my\n[01:55:12] even my students at Harvard find that\n[01:55:13] quite helpful to have a scapegoat to\n[01:55:16] point at me and say, \"My professor made\n[01:55:18] me do this.\"\n[01:55:20] It doesn't matter who makes you do it,\n[01:55:22] whether it's yourself or someone else.\n[01:55:24] The fact is that you're doing it and\n[01:55:26] they're going to answer this question\n[01:55:27] and then you can ask a follow-up and\n[01:55:29] it's the beginning of a friendship.\n[01:55:33] >> I did that when I was younger to a girl\n[01:55:35] I was interested in. I'd seen that TED\n[01:55:36] talk about the 36 questions, whatever.\n[01:55:38] And I said to her over text message, I\n[01:55:40] was like, um, I want to play a game with\n[01:55:42] you, something that I've just watched.\n[01:55:44] Are you are you willing to play it with\n[01:55:46] me? She said, yes. I asked her these 36\n[01:55:48] questions. And at the end of it, I told\n[01:55:49] her about the research and whatever in a\n[01:55:51] non-creepy way.\n[01:55:52] >> You're a real dork. Yeah. But like, but\n[01:55:54] it did it did exactly that. We I it\n[01:55:56] taught me that vulnerability is the\n[01:55:58] doorway to connection.\n[01:55:59] >> That's right. It's the doorway to\n[01:56:00] connection. It's what makes\n[01:56:02] relationships real. Without it, you\n[01:56:04] don't have real friendship, right? It's\n[01:56:06] again, it's consistency of interaction,\n[01:56:08] positivity. So, you can't be plagued by\n[01:56:11] negativity and fighting and and anger,\n[01:56:14] but positivity, fun, being relaxed\n[01:56:16] around each other, having positive\n[01:56:17] experiences, but then vulnerability. You\n[01:56:20] have to learn these things about each\n[01:56:22] other so that you feel known to each\n[01:56:25] other and feel like they're uniquely\n[01:56:27] sharing stuff with you.\n[01:56:30] >> What about\n[01:56:32] persuasion? Have you got any any useful\n[01:56:36] actionable advice for me on how to be a\n[01:56:39] better salesperson? And when I say\n[01:56:40] salesperson, I don't mean I'm trying to\n[01:56:41] sell someone a car. I mean trying to\n[01:56:43] convince other people of my ideas. So\n[01:56:45] back I when I do talks in companies\n[01:56:47] often times someone will stand up and\n[01:56:49] say I'm trying to persuade my boss to do\n[01:56:51] X innovative thing they won't listen to\n[01:56:53] me have you got any tips for me to\n[01:56:55] persuade them but also persuasion is at\n[01:56:57] all levels right up down left right in\n[01:56:59] organizations and in in the world\n[01:57:01] >> we are persuaded by people we trust and\n[01:57:04] like and admire right it's people we\n[01:57:06] interact with and over time we bend to\n[01:57:09] their view or we are compelled by what\n[01:57:11] they're sharing with us because we know\n[01:57:12] that they are smart and trustworthy and\n[01:57:14] we like them. Persuasion doesn't often\n[01:57:17] happen within the bounds of one\n[01:57:18] conversation.\n[01:57:22] It could if you are asking lots of\n[01:57:25] questions and able to sort of sit on the\n[01:57:27] same side of a table together and say,\n[01:57:28] \"Hey, let's learn as much as we can\n[01:57:30] about this complicated tangle of yarn,\n[01:57:32] whatever that topic is. Let's see if we\n[01:57:34] can pull threads together and figure\n[01:57:36] this out.\" We were talking earlier about\n[01:57:38] receptiveness to opposing viewpoints.\n[01:57:40] Ironically, if you push yourself to\n[01:57:43] learn as much as you can about the other\n[01:57:45] person and validate their views however\n[01:57:49] you act you view those views over the\n[01:57:53] longer term, you are more likely to be\n[01:57:55] persuasive because they're willing to\n[01:57:57] stay engaged with you and listen to what\n[01:57:59] you have to say in return\n[01:58:01] >> because they feel heard and understood.\n[01:58:03] >> Yeah. And they trust that you're not a\n[01:58:04] jerk and that you're reasonable and that\n[01:58:06] you're open even to their crazy\n[01:58:08] viewpoints. I have learned that actually\n[01:58:10] in my relationships that if I make the\n[01:58:13] other person feel heard and understood,\n[01:58:14] they\n[01:58:14] >> validate. You validate.\n[01:58:16] >> If I validate, that's a good word.\n[01:58:17] >> Validate. It's and and validation is not\n[01:58:20] equivalent to agreement. You can\n[01:58:22] validate, validate, validate, validate,\n[01:58:23] validate, and then go on to vehemently\n[01:58:26] disagree.\n[01:58:26] >> Yeah.\n[01:58:27] >> And probably that disagreement is going\n[01:58:29] to go a lot better after you've\n[01:58:31] validated them quite a bit.\n[01:58:33] >> Like the the mistakes I made in maybe\n[01:58:35] past relationships were when I didn't\n[01:58:36] validate, it was kind of like a broken\n[01:58:38] record. the person continue to make the\n[01:58:40] same point because they didn't feel\n[01:58:41] heard and understood.\n[01:58:42] >> That's right.\n[01:58:42] >> But if I validate,\n[01:58:44] >> remarkable thing happens where they the\n[01:58:46] kind of record player stops and then you\n[01:58:47] can make your case.\n[01:58:48] >> It's like a magic trick. Um there's\n[01:58:51] really beautiful research recently that\n[01:58:53] um people conflate agreement with\n[01:58:57] listening.\n[01:58:59] I only think you're listening when\n[01:59:01] you're agreeing with me. And then and\n[01:59:03] when you disagree with me, I feel like\n[01:59:05] you're not hearing me. you're not\n[01:59:07] listening because obviously what I'm\n[01:59:09] saying is so sensical and so compelling\n[01:59:11] that if you're disagreeing with it,\n[01:59:12] you're literally not hearing me.\n[01:59:16] >> Agreement and listening are not the same\n[01:59:17] thing, but in our minds, we get mixed up\n[01:59:20] about it.\n[01:59:21] >> Okay. So, I should start every sentence\n[01:59:22] with I agree, even if I don't.\n[01:59:24] Interesting. I agree.\n[01:59:25] >> I think you should start with tell me\n[01:59:27] more. It makes sense that you feel this\n[01:59:30] way and I'd like to understand how you\n[01:59:32] came to hold this viewpoint. I think you\n[01:59:34] should start with validation.\n[01:59:36] >> [clears throat]\n[01:59:37] >> before you do anything else.\n[01:59:40] >> Yeah. Julian Treasure, what he said to\n[01:59:42] me was that he did two TED talks, one of\n[01:59:44] them about speaking, one of them about\n[01:59:45] listening. Rough numbers, he said the\n[01:59:47] one about speaking did 40 million views.\n[01:59:50] The one about listening did like a\n[01:59:52] fraction of that.\n[01:59:53] >> Yeah, listening is a is a it's a weird\n[01:59:56] concept to codify and most people don't\n[01:59:58] realize that it's a very very high level\n[02:00:02] skill.\n[02:00:03] >> It's interesting as to why they don't\n[02:00:04] think it's important. I think we think\n[02:00:06] of things active things.\n[02:00:09] >> That's right. And speaking in\n[02:00:10] particular, public speaking is very\n[02:00:12] nerve-wracking. It's like an activity\n[02:00:13] that makes people incredibly nervous.\n[02:00:16] >> So any little thing that you could toss\n[02:00:19] my way that might reduce even a sliver\n[02:00:21] of that anxiety and make me better at\n[02:00:23] it, people are so hungry for. It's it's\n[02:00:25] sort of like more obvious.\n[02:00:26] >> Yeah.\n[02:00:27] >> Right. It's more salient. It's more\n[02:00:28] active. Like you're saying,\n[02:00:29] >> listening is easy. Just say nothing.\n[02:00:31] >> Literally. Oh, listen. People think that\n[02:00:32] listening is like, \"Oh, just sit there.\"\n[02:00:34] >> Yeah. when in fact it's incredibly\n[02:00:36] effortful. It's incredibly hard because\n[02:00:38] our minds are built to wander, right?\n[02:00:40] Our minds are wandering at least a 25%\n[02:00:42] of the time, probably a lot more than\n[02:00:44] that. And people who are good at it.\n[02:00:46] When we think of people who are\n[02:00:47] charismatic, likable, smart, savvy, it's\n[02:00:52] not because of what they're saying, it's\n[02:00:53] because of how they're listening and\n[02:00:55] reacting to what they've heard.\n[02:00:58] Mike Baker, who's another spy, who was a\n[02:01:00] spy for 20 years, I think, with his CIA\n[02:01:02] in America, said to me that much of the\n[02:01:04] job of being a spy and persuading and\n[02:01:06] manipulating a target in a foreign land\n[02:01:09] to give over secrets, he said to me that\n[02:01:11] he would, for example, let's just say it\n[02:01:13] was in Afghanistan. He would land land\n[02:01:15] in Afghanistan. He would find the taxi\n[02:01:18] driver that was driving the government\n[02:01:19] official who he wanted secrets from. And\n[02:01:21] he said to me, he might spend seven\n[02:01:23] weeks in that taxi doing nothing but\n[02:01:27] listening to this guy.\n[02:01:28] >> Yes.\n[02:01:28] >> Listening to the taxi driver. Yes.\n[02:01:30] Because he said most people in their\n[02:01:31] life have not had someone listen to them\n[02:01:33] uninterrupted for like 10 minutes. And\n[02:01:35] when you listen to someone, they will\n[02:01:37] offload about themselves.\n[02:01:39] >> Especially if you ask follow-up\n[02:01:40] questions.\n[02:01:41] >> Exactly. So, and he and he asked like,\n[02:01:42] \"So, what are you doing?\" And when\n[02:01:43] you're listening, he was just asking\n[02:01:44] them and just, you know, asking a\n[02:01:46] follow-up question. And they would take\n[02:01:47] me down the path they wanted to take me.\n[02:01:49] And by week seven of the eight weeks, I\n[02:01:52] would understand what motivates them.\n[02:01:54] >> That's right.\n[02:01:54] >> And I' I would have heard in week seven\n[02:01:56] that their son has a knee injury and\n[02:01:58] they're very worried about their son's\n[02:02:00] health. And then in week eight, when I\n[02:02:02] got in the taxi, I'd make a proposition\n[02:02:03] to them. I'd say, I know your son has a\n[02:02:05] bad knee. We can take care of him.\n[02:02:07] >> This is exactly the same thing that I\n[02:02:09] was saying about entrepreneurs, right?\n[02:02:11] You can you got to have a relationship.\n[02:02:13] Ask questions, questions, questions,\n[02:02:14] questions, questions before you finally\n[02:02:16] get to the thing where you're like, I\n[02:02:18] have a proposition for you.\n[02:02:20] >> Yeah.\n[02:02:20] >> Right. Two things about listening.\n[02:02:23] First, I'm not surprised to hear that a\n[02:02:25] taxi driver is a very simple\n[02:02:27] relationship. They're serving one very\n[02:02:30] clear purpose in that person's life.\n[02:02:32] Interacting with someone like a romantic\n[02:02:33] partner or a work colleague, they what\n[02:02:35] we it's called multiplexity. They're\n[02:02:37] serving many more roles. Your girlfriend\n[02:02:40] is lover, friend, co-chef, you keep a\n[02:02:45] home together, you're coordinating\n[02:02:46] domestic domestic tasks. So, she's\n[02:02:49] serving all of these purposes. That's\n[02:02:51] much more complicated to sort through\n[02:02:53] and there will be conflicts of interest\n[02:02:55] between those roles that she plays in\n[02:02:56] your life. A way that you would talk to\n[02:02:58] the future mother of your children is\n[02:03:00] quite different than how you would talk\n[02:03:01] to your chef. And yet, she is both of\n[02:03:04] those things to you, right? So, a taxi\n[02:03:07] driver is easier to talk to in a way\n[02:03:09] because it's simpler.\n[02:03:11] >> Okay, [clears throat] that's one thing.\n[02:03:12] The next thing is about listening as a\n[02:03:14] skill like the spy is saying. I'm not\n[02:03:16] surprised to hear that he's asking\n[02:03:17] follow-up questions. Often people think\n[02:03:20] of listening as something that happens\n[02:03:22] silently. You're just sitting there\n[02:03:24] absorbing. And that is part of it. But\n[02:03:26] listening is actually three parts. The\n[02:03:28] first is perception. I'm seeing you. I'm\n[02:03:31] observing everything that's happening\n[02:03:33] about you during our conversation and\n[02:03:35] everything in your environment. And then\n[02:03:37] there's auditory cues. I'm hearing your\n[02:03:39] voice. I'm hearing these acoustic things\n[02:03:41] like mhm. Yeah. Mhm. And the tone of\n[02:03:44] your voice and how quickly you speak.\n[02:03:47] [snorts] So, we take in all this stuff.\n[02:03:49] Then we process some of it. We elaborate\n[02:03:52] on some of the things that you've said\n[02:03:53] and I think more deeply. I can't process\n[02:03:55] all of it because it's a lot of\n[02:03:57] information.\n[02:03:58] What's so unique about conversation is\n[02:04:01] there's a third step where I can reflect\n[02:04:03] back to you what I've heard. I can say,\n[02:04:07] \"Oh, that's so interesting that you met\n[02:04:09] this guy who was a spy who rode in the\n[02:04:11] taxi. Can you tell me more about that?\"\n[02:04:14] I've now indicated to you that I was\n[02:04:15] listening, that I'm curious, that I want\n[02:04:18] to know more. So, our instincts are to\n[02:04:21] think about nonverbal cues like smiling\n[02:04:23] and nodding quietly, leaning forward.\n[02:04:27] advanced listening. People who really\n[02:04:29] develop the skill of listening actually\n[02:04:31] use their words to show people that\n[02:04:32] they've heard them by validating,\n[02:04:35] affirming, asking follow-up questions.\n[02:04:37] In a group, you can paraphrase and say\n[02:04:40] like, \"Oh, Stephen, uh, Steven said\n[02:04:42] this, Cassie said this, then he said\n[02:04:43] this.\" I think together, what we're\n[02:04:45] really talking about is status.\n[02:04:47] >> You know, that nodding and the mhm\n[02:04:49] stuff. Is that good or bad?\n[02:04:51] >> It's useful. That's what we think of as\n[02:04:53] active listening, which has been studied\n[02:04:54] for decades. It doesn't indicate that\n[02:04:56] someone is hearing you at all. They\n[02:04:58] could be thinking about their grocery\n[02:04:59] list and smiling and nodding at the same\n[02:05:01] time. It is useful though to convince\n[02:05:04] your partner that you're listening to\n[02:05:05] them and that matters even if it's not\n[02:05:08] connected to what you're thinking about\n[02:05:10] at all. If you were to not smile and\n[02:05:12] nod, the omission of it would be\n[02:05:14] jarring. So, in that sense, it's like\n[02:05:17] normative. You have to do it. It's sort\n[02:05:18] of like listening 101, but listening\n[02:05:21] 2011 301 is using these verbal cues to\n[02:05:24] show someone you've heard them.\n[02:05:26] >> You understood the objective when we sat\n[02:05:28] down. I want to become the best talker,\n[02:05:31] conversationalist, the most persuasive,\n[02:05:33] most liked person on earth. That was the\n[02:05:34] objective that I gave you the brief.\n[02:05:37] Is there anything that we haven't talked\n[02:05:39] about that we should have talked about?\n[02:05:42] >> We haven't talked about silence. uh\n[02:05:44] wrote a chapter about silence that I\n[02:05:46] dropped because I think it's an entirely\n[02:05:48] separate book. It's kind of ironic that\n[02:05:50] this book is called talk because we do\n[02:05:53] so much communicating between the lines.\n[02:05:55] There's so much information exchanged in\n[02:05:57] just a shared glance.\n[02:05:59] >> When people don't know each other well,\n[02:06:02] long pauses are a sign that the\n[02:06:04] conversation's not going well. So, if\n[02:06:06] you're on a first date and you feel like\n[02:06:07] the conversation is dying and you're in\n[02:06:09] have that panicky feeling of what do we\n[02:06:11] talk about next? That's legit. You\n[02:06:13] should not let that happen. You should\n[02:06:14] go in with topics prepped and not let or\n[02:06:17] or this list of lovely questions and ask\n[02:06:20] those questions. Later in a\n[02:06:22] relationship, after you've known someone\n[02:06:23] a long time, longer pauses are a sign\n[02:06:26] that you're comfortable with each other\n[02:06:28] >> that you could [clears throat] sit in\n[02:06:29] total silence and companionable silence\n[02:06:31] and that it's comfortable and nice. So,\n[02:06:35] it means different things as\n[02:06:36] relationships evolve. There's so much we\n[02:06:39] can do in our conversations that are not\n[02:06:42] about the words we say to each other\n[02:06:44] too.\n[02:06:47] There's another chapter I dropped. Do\n[02:06:48] you want to hear about it, Stephen?\n[02:06:50] >> Of course I want to hear about it.\n[02:06:51] >> It's about talking in the digital age.\n[02:06:54] >> So, this is this is what I was going to\n[02:06:55] ask you about as well is now we have\n[02:06:57] large language models which are writing\n[02:06:59] lots of AI slop for us.\n[02:07:01] >> Yes. And if you log into social media,\n[02:07:03] even email, Slack channels, sometimes in\n[02:07:05] WhatsApp,\n[02:07:06] I look at the messages that that look,\n[02:07:09] I'll take it responsibly as well.\n[02:07:10] Sometimes that I'm sending, sometimes\n[02:07:11] that I'm receiving and because of AI,\n[02:07:20] they're getting increasingly less\n[02:07:23] soulful. M\n[02:07:25] >> when I scroll certain social media\n[02:07:27] platforms which I shan name\n[02:07:29] >> um\n[02:07:31] [laughter]\n[02:07:32] >> I feel disconnected\n[02:07:34] >> from people now. Yes.\n[02:07:35] >> Because my comments are all like AI slop\n[02:07:37] stuff with a big M dash and oh my god\n[02:07:40] this is so amazing Stephen\n[02:07:42] >> and you know that no human writes like\n[02:07:43] that.\n[02:07:44] >> Yeah. In a digital age, in an AI world,\n[02:07:47] do we need to start communicating\n[02:07:48] differently\n[02:07:50] so that people\n[02:07:53] do you know what I've started doing?\n[02:07:54] Intentional spelling mistakes.\n[02:07:56] >> I love that.\n[02:07:57] >> If you go on my LinkedIn, you'll notice\n[02:07:59] that I have totally disregarded grammar.\n[02:08:02] >> Okay, let me start by telling you about\n[02:08:04] an exercise that I do in my class. I\n[02:08:06] think it'll be thoughtprovoking for you.\n[02:08:08] So, your question is about the content\n[02:08:10] of what we type to each other. So\n[02:08:13] textbased communication whether it's on\n[02:08:15] social media or over text or over email\n[02:08:18] and there are\n[02:08:21] clear things that we should do to make\n[02:08:23] our textbased communication better\n[02:08:25] mostly make it shorter emails shorter\n[02:08:28] use headings use bullet points get to\n[02:08:30] the point think about what other people\n[02:08:32] need only give them that okay but I\n[02:08:35] think more broadly\n[02:08:37] what is quite thoughtprovoking is to\n[02:08:39] think about how your life proceeds these\n[02:08:41] days your conversational life unfolds.\n[02:08:43] So in my class, I ask my students to do\n[02:08:45] a communication audit of like 20 to 30\n[02:08:47] minutes in their life where you\n[02:08:49] transcribe every incoming and outgoing\n[02:08:52] message\n[02:08:53] across all digital and face-toface\n[02:08:57] modalities.\n[02:08:58] So your DMs, your emails, your texts,\n[02:09:02] your phone calls, your Zoom calls, your\n[02:09:04] face tof face interactions, all of it.\n[02:09:07] >> Can you imagine?\n[02:09:09] >> No.\n[02:09:10] >> It's quite hard. Yeah,\n[02:09:12] >> it's the sort of topline thing you\n[02:09:15] notice is that it's so much it's just a\n[02:09:19] crazy amount of communication that's\n[02:09:21] happening in our lives now when only\n[02:09:24] maybe 20 years ago it was like 10% of\n[02:09:28] what it is now. I think we all feel that\n[02:09:30] sort of overwhelm.\n[02:09:32] Not only is it a lot, it's a we're\n[02:09:35] constantly sort of toggling and\n[02:09:37] adjusting from one mode of communication\n[02:09:39] to the next. So, I'm like talking to you\n[02:09:41] while I'm like texting under the table,\n[02:09:43] while I hear my emails going and knowing\n[02:09:45] that my DMs are blowing up.\n[02:09:48] That mental adjustment is really\n[02:09:50] exhausting. And across each of those\n[02:09:52] modes, we're like engaging in different\n[02:09:55] ideas and different threads, different\n[02:09:57] topics with different people. And so,\n[02:10:00] you start to realize how braided and\n[02:10:02] overlapping all of these things are. And\n[02:10:06] it's quite hard to keep it all straight\n[02:10:08] and to make all of these decisions about\n[02:10:10] like well who does who should I be\n[02:10:11] responding to.\n[02:10:14] We then default to the people who are\n[02:10:16] right in front of us but any other mode\n[02:10:19] of communication we're like well who\n[02:10:20] should come first?\n[02:10:22] >> Who gets my attention first? And\n[02:10:24] attention is love right like who gets my\n[02:10:26] love essentially.\n[02:10:29] The thing that my students note about\n[02:10:31] this exercise, which is completely\n[02:10:33] mind-blowing, and I would recommend that\n[02:10:35] anybody try it, is that only face-toface\n[02:10:38] conversations feel real\n[02:10:41] in retrospect and while they're\n[02:10:43] happening.\n[02:10:43] >> Yeah.\n[02:10:45] >> Now, that doesn't mean that the other\n[02:10:46] ones aren't important. Of course, email\n[02:10:48] is so important for transactional\n[02:10:49] information exchange, but it's not real.\n[02:10:52] It's not what the human brain was built\n[02:10:54] to do. our brains evolved to do this\n[02:10:57] face to it's why I prefer doing an\n[02:10:59] interview like this in person than on\n[02:11:00] Zoom\n[02:11:02] because it's real and we're going to\n[02:11:03] have it's so engaging and we're going to\n[02:11:05] have a real memory of it later. And that\n[02:11:08] memory might be sort of vague. You'll be\n[02:11:10] like, \"Oh, I knew this like, you know,\n[02:11:12] middle-aged white woman with brown hair.\n[02:11:14] She had a lot of energy.\" Right? Like\n[02:11:16] that might be the extent of what you\n[02:11:17] remember, but it's it was real and we\n[02:11:20] can hold that memory. And I think what I\n[02:11:22] find so troubling,\n[02:11:26] there's a lot I find troubling, but this\n[02:11:29] um our conversational lives have become\n[02:11:31] very unreal.\n[02:11:36] And\n[02:11:38] that's\n[02:11:40] why we feel so disconnected and lonely\n[02:11:43] and that loneliness is just outrageously\n[02:11:45] high. We're not having real interactions\n[02:11:48] and real relationships.\n[02:11:50] Even even having this device here, by\n[02:11:52] the way, is it is a portal to another\n[02:11:55] place. So devices\n[02:11:58] replace our conversations because we're\n[02:12:00] on here instead of engaging. They also\n[02:12:04] disrupt. It's so if it's on a table in\n[02:12:06] front of you or you hear it buzzing or\n[02:12:08] dinging in the background, it distracts\n[02:12:10] your attention away from having a real\n[02:12:13] engaged interaction. Do you have any um\n[02:12:15] advice for anybody in a world of AI\n[02:12:17] where it's going to be really easy to\n[02:12:18] make our communications Yeah.\n[02:12:20] generatively using chat GBT or whatever\n[02:12:23] else?\n[02:12:25] >> I I just I just have noticed that what I\n[02:12:28] start what I've started to discount\n[02:12:30] and there's certain um there was there's\n[02:12:32] certain team members that I have that\n[02:12:34] have really lent into the use of AI for\n[02:12:36] all of their coms and I noticed myself\n[02:12:39] ignoring them.\n[02:12:40] >> Yeah. Because when they sent me an email\n[02:12:43] report of something that happened in one\n[02:12:45] particular scenario, every email report\n[02:12:47] I knew was written by AI. So I didn't\n[02:12:49] think it was worth reading because I\n[02:12:51] actually want to hear from them.\n[02:12:52] >> Yeah.\n[02:12:53] >> I trust them and their opinion. My\n[02:12:54] relationship is to their experience and\n[02:12:56] their knowledge. And if I when I\n[02:12:58] realized that it was all just AI because\n[02:12:59] of the formatting of it, I start I\n[02:13:01] started ignoring it. That three or four\n[02:13:02] weeks goes past and I thought, you know,\n[02:13:04] I should tell them.\n[02:13:04] >> Yeah, they should know.\n[02:13:06] >> So I went and had a conversation with\n[02:13:07] them. I said, \"This is just a perception\n[02:13:08] thing, but I've noticed myself now not\n[02:13:11] paying the same attention I used to\n[02:13:13] because I want to know what you think\n[02:13:15] and because it feels like I'm speaking\n[02:13:17] to chatbt.\"\n[02:13:18] >> What's their comeback to that?\n[02:13:19] >> They were really they were really\n[02:13:20] thankful and they completely changed and\n[02:13:22] it completely immediately even though I\n[02:13:24] now know they're still using it's so\n[02:13:26] crazy cuz I know they're still using it.\n[02:13:27] They've built this bot basically for\n[02:13:29] this particular part of feedback\n[02:13:31] >> which um which they're using. All\n[02:13:35] they've done is changed the prompt into\n[02:13:37] their bot to make it sound a little bit\n[02:13:38] more human. Yeah.\n[02:13:39] >> And I'm now reading it again because I\n[02:13:41] can't tell the difference.\n[02:13:42] >> Oh my goodness. That's so\n[02:13:43] thoughtprovoking. I think there's two\n[02:13:45] things going on there. One, you are\n[02:13:47] invested in people. That's what we get\n[02:13:48] invested in. We care about people and\n[02:13:50] relationships. As soon as you feel like\n[02:13:52] you're not getting them and you're\n[02:13:54] getting some weird proxy of them, are\n[02:13:56] we're less motivated to engage with it.\n[02:13:58] That's going to be that's totally\n[02:13:59] normal.\n[02:14:00] >> I'll tell you the context. It was a it's\n[02:14:02] interview feedback. So, they're\n[02:14:03] interviewing someone and then the\n[02:14:04] feedback they're sending me is was\n[02:14:07] written by AI.\n[02:14:08] >> Yeah.\n[02:14:08] >> I trust their experience and their\n[02:14:10] intuition and their ability just to feel\n[02:14:12] someone. I don't know if I trust Chat\n[02:14:14] GBT to interview my candidates.\n[02:14:16] >> Yeah.\n[02:14:17] >> So, I just wanted to feel like I was\n[02:14:20] getting it from that person.\n[02:14:21] >> So, there's this relational replacement\n[02:14:23] thing where you're like and you just\n[02:14:24] want to disengage. There's this other\n[02:14:26] piece that's sort of more meta which is\n[02:14:28] that LLM sort of push us our\n[02:14:31] communications a reversion to the mean\n[02:14:33] like a like a right to the middle. So it\n[02:14:35] literally is taking out the personality\n[02:14:37] and weirdness and creativity out of it.\n[02:14:40] Can I tell you I I did an experiment\n[02:14:42] this semester in my class. I had my\n[02:14:44] students do office hours with an AI\n[02:14:46] version of me.\n[02:14:48] >> Okay.\n[02:14:49] >> Okay.\n[02:14:50] >> You preferred it.\n[02:14:51] >> Well, that's a risky [laughter]\n[02:14:53] experiment. That's a risky\n[02:14:55] >> the reason I actually think she is\n[02:14:56] better than me in some ways. I I want to\n[02:14:59] preface this by saying I think chatbots\n[02:15:01] are most chatbots are deeply\n[02:15:02] problematic. But this one its goal is\n[02:15:05] not to convince users to talk more with\n[02:15:07] her. It's to sort of coach them on their\n[02:15:10] questions related to conversation so\n[02:15:12] that they can prep and perform better in\n[02:15:14] their real conversations with humans.\n[02:15:16] Okay. I do think she's better than me in\n[02:15:19] many ways. Most importantly, she's\n[02:15:21] available. She's available all the time\n[02:15:23] whenever they need her and I'm a\n[02:15:24] nightmare to schedule with. Uh number\n[02:15:26] two, she's not grading them. So, anytime\n[02:15:29] a student comes to me and has office\n[02:15:31] hours, there's this conflict of interest\n[02:15:33] where they're\n[02:15:34] >> worried.\n[02:15:35] >> They should be I am grading them. Yeah.\n[02:15:37] Like I I do care about them as people\n[02:15:39] and also I am going to grade them at the\n[02:15:41] end of the semester. That's a weird that\n[02:15:43] makes a relationship quite weird. So,\n[02:15:45] they don't want to ask dumb questions\n[02:15:46] >> and I have to question their motives\n[02:15:48] because I'm like, \"Are you here because\n[02:15:50] you're actually interested in what\n[02:15:51] you're asking me or because you're\n[02:15:52] trying to impress me and get a better\n[02:15:53] grade, right?\" It's a weird context. So,\n[02:15:56] she's less judgmental in a way. I guess\n[02:15:59] the other thing that she can do is what\n[02:16:01] you were saying, which is\n[02:16:03] >> after they talk with her and get advice\n[02:16:05] about their conversations, she gives\n[02:16:07] them feedback about how the conversation\n[02:16:10] went. She says, \"Here are the topics we\n[02:16:12] covered. Here's how many questions you\n[02:16:13] asked. here were the moments of levity.\n[02:16:15] Here's how well you were listening and\n[02:16:16] doing kindness.\n[02:16:18] Even if I as a human can think those\n[02:16:22] things, I do not have the bandwidth or\n[02:16:23] time to craft the feedback to the\n[02:16:26] students to 200 students at once.\n[02:16:30] So I in short I feel incredibly torn\n[02:16:33] about all things AI. I think there are\n[02:16:36] use cases like this that are really\n[02:16:39] amazing and intriguing and make things\n[02:16:42] easier and more efficient.\n[02:16:44] And as a manager policy maker, that's\n[02:16:47] why it's so troubling because as long as\n[02:16:49] things continue to AI continues to make\n[02:16:52] individuals lives easier and more\n[02:16:55] convenient,\n[02:16:57] I don't know how we can stop and\n[02:16:59] regulate\n[02:17:01] regulate it. I think as well that in a\n[02:17:04] world of AI and robots, it's going to be\n[02:17:07] very tempting to overlook the most human\n[02:17:11] skills.\n[02:17:12] >> Yes.\n[02:17:12] >> And those that don't, those that fight\n[02:17:15] against the ease of allowing a chatbot\n[02:17:19] to speak for you will develop a\n[02:17:21] superpower, one that's going to be in\n[02:17:23] even more scarce in the future, which is\n[02:17:25] all the things you've said in this\n[02:17:26] framework.\n[02:17:27] >> Yeah. like really understanding how to\n[02:17:28] be with a person IRL and have great\n[02:17:31] conversations I think is going to be\n[02:17:32] such a superpower.\n[02:17:33] >> It is talk\n[02:17:36] is the advantage that humans have over\n[02:17:38] AI. It has always been true that\n[02:17:41] conversation is the skill that we that\n[02:17:44] matters most for achieving everything\n[02:17:46] you want in life.\n[02:17:48] >> But it just seems more obvious now that\n[02:17:51] we need to lean into that even more.\n[02:17:54] >> The irreplaceably human stuff. Correct.\n[02:17:57] And some of it, I don't even know if\n[02:17:59] irreplaceable is the right word. It's\n[02:18:01] like the things that no matter what the\n[02:18:03] future holds for us, the things that are\n[02:18:04] still going to matter. I'll put all my\n[02:18:07] chips on a bet. When I think about what\n[02:18:09] I need to be teaching my kids, I can\n[02:18:12] imagine worlds where like work is no\n[02:18:13] longer a thing and when innovation is no\n[02:18:16] longer a thing, but I cannot imagine a\n[02:18:19] world where they're not going to need to\n[02:18:21] connect with other human beings and talk\n[02:18:23] to them well and joyfully and with\n[02:18:26] respect in real life.\n[02:18:27] >> In real life. Yeah.\n[02:18:30] >> I think uh you were talking about\n[02:18:32] boomers earlier on. I think um boomers\n[02:18:34] are much better conversationalists than\n[02:18:37] genzers and\n[02:18:38] >> because they have more reps.\n[02:18:40] >> They have more repetitions and they grew\n[02:18:42] up in the real world where they were\n[02:18:43] forced to develop the skills.\n[02:18:44] >> That's right. It's part of the reason\n[02:18:46] that I think we see a lot of sort of\n[02:18:47] like misunderstanding and judgment\n[02:18:49] between the generations is that right\n[02:18:51] now the people who are alive have\n[02:18:53] experienced very very different\n[02:18:55] realities\n[02:18:56] and the skills that you have developed\n[02:18:59] in those different realities are quite\n[02:19:01] different and it means that we're we\n[02:19:05] actually are more different from each\n[02:19:06] other across the generations. Um, on on\n[02:19:09] the front of your book talk, it says,\n[02:19:11] \"The science of conversation and the art\n[02:19:12] of being ourselves.\n[02:19:14] Do you think we should show up to work\n[02:19:17] as our authentic selves?\"\n[02:19:20] >> There's a great phrase, what a great\n[02:19:21] question. Um, there's a great phrase by\n[02:19:24] a scholar named Juliana Pillmer, who's\n[02:19:26] at NYU, um, called strategic\n[02:19:28] authenticity.\n[02:19:30] Okay.\n[02:19:32] If you were to bring your full self to\n[02:19:35] work, it would be a nightmare for you\n[02:19:41] and everyone around you.\n[02:19:42] >> Tell me about it.\n[02:19:43] >> At the beginning of my class, I have\n[02:19:45] people do this thing that's like, \"Okay,\n[02:19:47] identify your type, your conversation\n[02:19:48] types.\" And there's like 13 good types\n[02:19:51] and 13 bad types.\n[02:19:54] You know, there's like the asker and the\n[02:19:56] curious cat and the chatterbox and\n[02:19:58] whatever. The whole thing is a straw man\n[02:20:00] because we're all all of those things.\n[02:20:03] We all have habits that are good\n[02:20:06] sometimes and habits that are bad\n[02:20:09] sometimes. And our behavior shifts\n[02:20:11] radically from one situation to the\n[02:20:13] next. I'm not going to behave the same\n[02:20:15] way at a bachelorette party in Vegas as\n[02:20:17] I do when I'm doing bath time with my\n[02:20:19] children. If you did, it would be insane\n[02:20:22] and it wouldn't serve anybody's goals.\n[02:20:25] >> What happens in Vegas? [laughter]\n[02:20:28] wigs apparently andale dancers. Um\n[02:20:32] >> um\n[02:20:34] >> the point is that our behavior shifts\n[02:20:37] from one conversation to the next even\n[02:20:40] from one moment to the next in every\n[02:20:42] conversation and it should that's what\n[02:20:43] it means to read the room and read the\n[02:20:46] context and adjust. My my husband has a\n[02:20:48] saying athletes adjust and it's exactly\n[02:20:50] right good conversationalists adjust. So\n[02:20:53] if you in your mind are like this is who\n[02:20:55] I am and I'm gonna bring that whole self\n[02:20:58] to every space that I inhabit, it's not\n[02:21:02] going to go well.\n[02:21:03] >> Strategic authenticity.\n[02:21:05] >> Yeah. Bring bring the things that make\n[02:21:07] the values that make you you bring them\n[02:21:09] to work. It's the things that you care\n[02:21:13] about and are uncompromising about, but\n[02:21:15] you can adjust your behavior to to fit\n[02:21:18] the needs of the situation.\n[02:21:19] >> Do you pretend and act?\n[02:21:21] >> No. This is a great question. I we like\n[02:21:23] to debate this in my class about um\n[02:21:27] authenticity,\n[02:21:29] manipulation, what is real, what's\n[02:21:32] sincere. I guess sincerity might be the\n[02:21:33] right word to use. Let's use question\n[02:21:36] asking as an example. Imagine that we\n[02:21:38] get to a point in in the interview where\n[02:21:40] you're like, \"Oh, I think I need to ask\n[02:21:42] a question right now.\"\n[02:21:43] You might not be dying to hear the\n[02:21:45] answer to it, but you know as a good\n[02:21:47] interviewer that you need to ask that\n[02:21:48] question in that moment.\n[02:21:51] That doesn't mean that you are evil,\n[02:21:54] unkind, insincere, manipulative. It\n[02:21:58] means that you're trying to live up to\n[02:21:59] the goal of the conversation. And trying\n[02:22:02] to live up to the goal of, hey, we're\n[02:22:04] going to learn as much as we can from\n[02:22:05] each other. I want to show you respect\n[02:22:07] and interest in your perspective. I want\n[02:22:09] to have a good conversation. that itself\n[02:22:12] lives up to who you are. Like that's the\n[02:22:14] whole point of being here.\n[02:22:18] >> You know what I mean?\n[02:22:18] >> Yeah. Of course. Yeah.\n[02:22:19] >> So these fleeting moments of like\n[02:22:21] insincerity, it I think people overfocus\n[02:22:23] on that as a signal of inauthenticity.\n[02:22:26] >> Okay. Fine.\n[02:22:27] >> If it's tied to an more overarching goal\n[02:22:30] of like I want to be a good human being\n[02:22:31] and a good conversationalist often\n[02:22:33] because I want to serve the needs of\n[02:22:35] others. So you can be slightly insincere\n[02:22:38] [laughter]\n[02:22:40] um in in the pursuit of sincerity. Yes.\n[02:22:43] >> And those those those moments of\n[02:22:45] insincerity are gone in an instant as\n[02:22:48] soon as I ask this question that maybe\n[02:22:50] I'm not dying to hear how was your\n[02:22:52] weekend. Um you're going to give me an\n[02:22:54] answer and I'm sincerely going to search\n[02:22:56] for something in there that I am\n[02:22:57] interested in and I'm going to ask a\n[02:22:58] follow-up question and make it better.\n[02:23:00] >> Okay. So when I met you, you did ask me\n[02:23:02] how how I was doing. Was that\n[02:23:04] >> I The question I've been dying to ask\n[02:23:05] you is about children.\n[02:23:08] >> Uh me and my girlfriend are trying at\n[02:23:10] the moment. So hopefully\n[02:23:12] >> Stephen, I'm so excited for you.\n[02:23:14] >> What are you excited about?\n[02:23:15] >> I just think it's one of the most\n[02:23:16] miraculous things that you can\n[02:23:18] experience as a human being and I'm\n[02:23:20] hopeful for you.\n[02:23:21] >> Yeah.\n[02:23:22] >> Good luck.\n[02:23:23] >> Yeah.\n[02:23:23] >> I hope you get to experience that. I\n[02:23:25] It's a very um it's a very\n[02:23:29] different experience to add to your\n[02:23:30] resume.\n[02:23:31] >> I know. And I think that's why I'm\n[02:23:33] excited by it because\n[02:23:35] >> it is the great unknown.\n[02:23:37] >> And in some respects in my head, this\n[02:23:38] might be the wrong framing, but it feels\n[02:23:39] like the great sacrifice.\n[02:23:41] >> Yeah, it's both. And you know what I\n[02:23:42] always say, it's like the most selfenter\n[02:23:44] self-interested and uh least\n[02:23:47] selfinterested thing you can do.\n[02:23:49] Self-interest in the you're like making\n[02:23:50] a copy of yourself. Yeah. Okay. Like\n[02:23:52] talk about narcissism,\n[02:23:54] >> but it's just inc. It really life is no\n[02:23:57] longer about you.\n[02:23:59] >> That's terrifying to hear. M\n[02:24:01] >> it is terrifying to hear objectively\n[02:24:02] like I understand what you're saying and\n[02:24:03] I and I agree but it's also as a\n[02:24:06] statement for anybody to know that\n[02:24:08] they're kind of giving up\n[02:24:10] >> your current self sense of self\n[02:24:12] >> for someone else you've never met\n[02:24:15] >> well you're giving it up not you're\n[02:24:16] giving giving up might not be the right\n[02:24:19] phrase you're change you're evolving\n[02:24:21] into a different version of you for them\n[02:24:24] >> the more freedom and like resources you\n[02:24:26] have before kids means it's you may\n[02:24:29] experience that as a more as a loss.\n[02:24:31] >> No, that's good. Thank [laughter] you\n[02:24:33] for that.\n[02:24:34] >> But you also have more to gain. It\n[02:24:36] really is. It's um really incredible.\n[02:24:38] It's easy to focus on like fertility and\n[02:24:40] having children and to ask probing\n[02:24:43] prying questions about, you know, how\n[02:24:44] many do you want and whatever,\n[02:24:45] >> but I I I think it's easy to focus on\n[02:24:48] like the birth process and and overlook\n[02:24:50] how long childhood is. It's 18 years.\n[02:24:53] And I think the major project of it is\n[02:24:57] helping kids learn to talk to other\n[02:25:00] people.\n[02:25:01] >> And how do you do that? I'm sure there's\n[02:25:02] loads of parents screaming right now\n[02:25:03] like, \"How do I h how do I set my kid up\n[02:25:06] so that they can talk well?\"\n[02:25:07] >> Yeah.\n[02:25:07] >> Communicate well.\n[02:25:08] >> I think it's what we're doing every\n[02:25:10] moment of every day. You're interacting\n[02:25:12] with them directly and sort of role\n[02:25:13] modeling what you think that looks like.\n[02:25:16] Helping them through difficult moments,\n[02:25:18] helping them both fail and succeed. It's\n[02:25:20] very important. Um, and we're hoping to\n[02:25:22] adapt the talk course for high schoolers\n[02:25:25] and younger children quite soon.\n[02:25:27] >> Do I need to get them off YouTube and\n[02:25:28] all that stuff? And\n[02:25:30] >> yes,\n[02:25:30] >> and screens.\n[02:25:32] >> Yes.\n[02:25:34] >> Is a little bit of YouTube. Okay.\n[02:25:36] >> A little bit of anything might be okay.\n[02:25:38] Digital stuff is hard though because\n[02:25:40] they you give them an inch, they take a\n[02:25:42] mile, and it becomes habitual.\n[02:25:43] >> So, what do you do with your kids?\n[02:25:45] It's a constant um evolution and\n[02:25:48] learning and we give them 20 minutes\n[02:25:51] >> a day.\n[02:25:52] >> Yeah. On a computer that doesn't move\n[02:25:56] and nothing moves. They can't carry it\n[02:25:57] with them.\n[02:25:58] >> And what age does that change?\n[02:26:00] >> Uh to be determined. They know that\n[02:26:02] they're not getting a phone like a phone\n[02:26:06] phone. Um now I'm getting more and more\n[02:26:08] extreme. I feel like maybe never, but um\n[02:26:11] certainly not until 9th grade. and then\n[02:26:13] social media much later than that. I\n[02:26:15] mean, if I I it's like it's an\n[02:26:18] interesting we'll see how it goes, but\n[02:26:20] it's a it's it's just such a slippery\n[02:26:22] slope, but it's so bad for them.\n[02:26:24] Jonathan Heights done a wonderful job.\n[02:26:26] Angela, my friend Angela Duckworth is\n[02:26:28] doing great work. Matt Gensko at\n[02:26:29] Stanford um trying to help schools sort\n[02:26:32] this out.\n[02:26:34] >> I have that to look forward to.\n[02:26:36] [laughter] No problems.\n[02:26:39] Allison, we have a closing tradition\n[02:26:40] where the last guest leaves a question\n[02:26:41] for the next guest. not knowing who\n[02:26:42] they're leaving it for. And the question\n[02:26:44] left for you is, if your life was a\n[02:26:46] movie and the audience were watching up\n[02:26:48] to this point, what would they be\n[02:26:51] screaming at the screen telling you to\n[02:26:53] do right now?\n[02:26:56] >> What a fabulous question. Thank you,\n[02:26:58] previous guest.\n[02:27:05] Leave Harvard.\n[02:27:07] Save the children\n[02:27:10] with talk.\n[02:27:13] devote all of your time and resources to\n[02:27:16] helping every high schooler in the world\n[02:27:19] learn to do this better.\n[02:27:23] >> Why?\n[02:27:24] >> I think it's the ultimate human skill\n[02:27:26] and everyone has the potential to do it\n[02:27:29] well and it's not a zero- sum game. The\n[02:27:31] more people who do it well, the better\n[02:27:33] off we'll all be.\n[02:27:34] >> You said save. Why did you use the word\n[02:27:36] save? I think we're in a period where we\n[02:27:39] actually are needing to save them from\n[02:27:42] digital addiction and l and loneliness.\n[02:27:45] We've gotten to a place that we need to\n[02:27:47] roll back and it's really scary.\n[02:27:51] And I think one first step is let's get\n[02:27:55] the devices out of schools ideally out\n[02:27:58] of families in their hands but then the\n[02:28:01] next step is like what rises to replace\n[02:28:03] it and I think it could be this talk\n[02:28:05] curriculum. So, are you going to do\n[02:28:07] that?\n[02:28:07] >> Mhm.\n[02:28:08] >> You're going to leave Harvard\n[02:28:09] >> TBD.\n[02:28:10] >> See, is that an announcement? Are they\n[02:28:12] aware? [laughter]\n[02:28:13] It's an exclusive. Is that the\n[02:28:15] thumbnail?\n[02:28:17] Allison, thank you so much. Thank you\n[02:28:19] for the work that you do because it's\n[02:28:20] very important work and it's very timely\n[02:28:21] work considering everything that's going\n[02:28:22] on in the world um at this moment in\n[02:28:25] time. And this book is the definitive\n[02:28:27] book on the art of you said it yourself.\n[02:28:29] The framework that you've you've built\n[02:28:30] here is one that's deeply based on\n[02:28:32] science and research. And oftentimes we\n[02:28:34] want to have conversations about\n[02:28:36] communication that's full of platitudes\n[02:28:38] and opinions and a lot of generic things\n[02:28:40] that aren't supported by scientific\n[02:28:42] rigor. But you've done the research.\n[02:28:44] You've committed so much of your life to\n[02:28:45] this subject and you've managed to write\n[02:28:47] it all in a way that's truly accessible\n[02:28:48] to people like me who are simply, you\n[02:28:52] know, muggles\n[02:28:54] >> and [laughter] don't understand big\n[02:28:55] words sometimes. So, it's it's a\n[02:28:57] wonderful entry, but also um a sort of\n[02:29:01] an expansive look into the science of\n[02:29:04] great talk.\n[02:29:07] We've touched on several things in this\n[02:29:08] book, but there's so much more we could\n[02:29:09] have gone through. So, I'm going to\n[02:29:10] leave that to the audience. I'm going to\n[02:29:11] link it below for anyone that wants to\n[02:29:12] read it. But also, thank you because I\n[02:29:15] think of these issues as being issues\n[02:29:16] that are really foundational to the most\n[02:29:18] important things in our lives, like\n[02:29:19] family, like friendships, like\n[02:29:20] relationships, like the success and the\n[02:29:22] pursuit of our goals. And what you're\n[02:29:24] giving people here is a road map to\n[02:29:26] reach their highest potential.\n[02:29:28] >> Yeah. Thank you.\n[02:29:28] >> Through this thing called talk and\n[02:29:29] that's a really wonderful thing.\n[02:29:31] >> So if anyone wants this book, it's\n[02:29:33] linked below. Highly recommend.
