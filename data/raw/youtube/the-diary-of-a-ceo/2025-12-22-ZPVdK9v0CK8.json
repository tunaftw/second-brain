  "transcript": "[00:00] What are the five most important things\n[00:02] for anyone who's striving to be a\n[00:04] masterful communicator to get what they\n[00:06] want out of life?\n[00:07] >> The first is authenticity and presence\n[00:10] is the highest form of authenticity.\n[00:12] >> Okay, on that point, I'm going to play\n[00:13] this video on the screen that went viral\n[00:15] of Marley Cyrus and Amy Campbell.\n[00:16] >> Oh, I haven't seen this.\n[00:19] That's painful to watch.\n[00:20] >> Number two,\n[00:21] >> reduce the amount of distraction. Three,\n[00:24] stop overexplaining.\n[00:26] >> Number four, know how to deal with their\n[00:28] sadness. And I'll go through all of\n[00:30] these in detail, but number five is you\n[00:32] have to know how to handle the\n[00:34] narcissist and the gaslighter. What do I\n[00:36] do? Let me show you. First, you need to\n[00:39] come.\n[00:40] >> Yeah. For a lot of people, that kind of\n[00:41] blows their mind. Jefferson Fiser is\n[00:44] back and the board certified trial\n[00:46] lawyer is using his expertise in\n[00:47] conflict resolution and communication\n[00:49] >> to teach couples, friends, employees,\n[00:52] >> and everyone in between how to master\n[00:54] difficult conversations.\n[00:55] >> Here's the truth. You have to invest in\n[00:57] your communication. If I don't say what\n[00:59] needs [music] to be said at work, I'll\n[01:01] lose that promotion. Same thing in\n[01:02] relationships. Most relationships don't\n[01:04] fall apart because they fell out of\n[01:06] love. They fell out of communication\n[01:08] because of a 100 moments where repair\n[01:09] could have happened and it didn't. Cuz\n[01:11] you said, \"Ah, this is so stupid. This\n[01:12] so small.\" Like there's a recent study\n[01:14] showing that the biggest predictor of\n[01:16] the child's well-being within the\n[01:17] parental relationship is not whether\n[01:19] they were married or divorced. It was\n[01:20] how they deal with conflict. But people\n[01:22] are definitely afraid of the conflict\n[01:24] that they're in cuz they don't know what\n[01:26] to say. And so I want to help them feel\n[01:28] controlled in this, feel confident in\n[01:29] this. And it's knowing things like being\n[01:31] right is overrated. If I respond first\n[01:33] with frustration, I'm going to lose\n[01:34] every time. Or if you want to know how\n[01:37] to handle the insults, the patronizing,\n[01:39] the dismissive, the first thing you have\n[01:41] to do is the mistake I've made multiple\n[01:44] times.\n[01:47] >> I see messages all the time in the\n[01:49] comment section that some of you didn't\n[01:50] realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you\n[01:52] could do me a favor and double check if\n[01:54] you're a subscriber to this channel,\n[01:55] that would be tremendously appreciated.\n[01:56] It's the simple, it's the free thing\n[01:58] that anybody that watches this show\n[02:00] frequently can do to help us here to\n[02:02] keep everything going in this show in\n[02:03] the trajectory it's on. So, please do\n[02:05] double check if you've subscribed and uh\n[02:07] thank you so much because in a strange\n[02:08] way, you are you're part of our history\n[02:11] and you're on this journey with us and I\n[02:12] appreciate you for that. So, yeah, thank\n[02:14] you.\n[02:16] [music]\n[02:17] [singing]\n[02:18] Jefferson Fisher.\n[02:20] >> What do you do professionally?\n[02:23] >> What is your How do you sort of\n[02:24] characterize your profession?\n[02:26] >> Well, I'm a trial attorney by trade.\n[02:28] >> What does that mean?\n[02:29] >> That means I help clients with legal\n[02:32] needs. I'm board certified in personal\n[02:34] injury. So, when people get hurt, I have\n[02:38] trials. So, that means there are other\n[02:40] attorneys that don't ever go to a\n[02:41] courtroom. I go into a courtroom.\n[02:43] >> Then you stand before a judge\n[02:45] >> and a Yeah. You have a judge, you have a\n[02:47] jury, you have a court reporter, a\n[02:49] baiff, you have opposing attorneys.\n[02:50] There are people in the room\n[02:51] >> and you try and convince those people of\n[02:53] your point of view to get a particular\n[02:55] outcome.\n[02:56] >> I advocate my client's facts in order to\n[02:58] get the result that they want.\n[02:59] >> So, why did you think it was important\n[03:01] to write a book about conversation\n[03:04] talking, getting what you want from\n[03:08] the conversations we have with people we\n[03:09] care about? Because I have seen time and\n[03:12] time again that when I am training a\n[03:14] client is what I call I'm preparing them\n[03:16] for cross- examination for deposition\n[03:19] they really don't know how to engage in\n[03:22] conflict. And so I can't think of any\n[03:24] other profession that is more entrenched\n[03:27] in conflict maybe outside of a a boxer\n[03:30] or some you know UFC something that\n[03:33] deals with actual conflict and sits\n[03:35] there and listens to it all than in the\n[03:38] legal world in a trial attorney. And so,\n[03:40] yeah, it's my job to advocate based on\n[03:42] my clients facts to to get them the\n[03:45] result that they want. The reason why I\n[03:46] wrote that book and how that book\n[03:48] applies is I took a lot of the lessons\n[03:50] that I teach every one of my clients and\n[03:53] put them in that book because I'm\n[03:55] sitting there preparing them for\n[03:56] cross-examination and realizing, oh,\n[03:58] wait, they are deathly afraid of the\n[04:01] conflict that they're in. is most of the\n[04:02] time it's the most\n[04:06] emotional, stressful, overwhelmed they\n[04:09] are ever in their life. They've they're\n[04:11] in a place they've never been. They\n[04:13] don't know what it's like. They've only\n[04:14] seen it on TV. And so it's my job to\n[04:16] kind of take their hand and say, \"This\n[04:18] is how we're going to this is how we're\n[04:20] going to do it.\"\n[04:21] >> And how does that apply to the average\n[04:22] person in their life?\n[04:23] >> People think that\n[04:26] the goal of any argument or any\n[04:28] conversation is to win. And same for a\n[04:32] trial. They say you want to win a trial.\n[04:34] I've seen it so many times where I've\n[04:35] gotten the result that they want and\n[04:36] I've realized they still have the\n[04:39] problem. They still wanted the apology.\n[04:41] It all would have been resolved. There'd\n[04:43] be no case if somebody had just said,\n[04:45] \"I'm sorry.\" And so you find that for\n[04:48] the everyday person, it's my job now and\n[04:52] and passion to be able to help them get\n[04:56] into conflict and say, \"I feel\n[04:58] controlled in this. I feel confident in\n[05:01] this now. I know exactly where I'm going\n[05:03] in this because I've been there before\n[05:05] and it is not a skill that comes\n[05:07] naturally. It is a skill that is\n[05:09] learned.\n[05:11] And what do you think is the the sort of\n[05:13] variance and outcome? How would my life\n[05:15] change if I became an absolute master in\n[05:18] this? You know, if I started from zero\n[05:21] in this regard and then I became a\n[05:23] master in dealing with conflict and\n[05:25] dealing with difficult people and\n[05:26] dealing with people that gaslight me and\n[05:28] dealing with narcissists and all these\n[05:29] kinds of things, why would my life be\n[05:31] different and and in what domains?\n[05:34] >> It's quite a lot.\n[05:35] >> Yeah. First would be you would be\n[05:37] equipped for outside of necessary\n[05:41] expertise anywhere you wanted to be in\n[05:43] life. People feel like communication is\n[05:47] zero cost. It costs you something. If\n[05:50] I'm not speaking up in that\n[05:51] relationship, it costs my own sense of\n[05:54] worth. If I don't say what needs to be\n[05:56] said at work, I might have lost that\n[05:59] promotion. I I everything the bill\n[06:02] always comes due. If you can think of\n[06:04] every time you didn't say the thing as\n[06:07] like a receipt at a restaurant, every\n[06:09] time it's it's a bill of what I am not\n[06:12] putting into my life because I chose to\n[06:15] either say something or not say\n[06:16] something at the right time. And when\n[06:18] you realize that if I can speak with\n[06:20] confidence, well, that's me gaining a\n[06:23] little bit more. If if I can say things\n[06:25] with control, that's me gaining just a\n[06:27] little bit more. A second benefit of it\n[06:30] is that you realize\n[06:33] being right is overrated.\n[06:35] You can, if you tell me the sky is\n[06:37] purple, knock yourself out, Stephen. It\n[06:40] doesn't have to touch anything with me\n[06:42] on on who I am or any of my opinions.\n[06:44] We're we're opinion-making machines. I\n[06:47] feel that's all on social media. It's to\n[06:49] be set up to give your opinion on things\n[06:51] that most of the time will rarely ever\n[06:53] touch you. And if you can have the peace\n[06:57] of mind of knowing\n[06:59] I don't need to agree with you to\n[07:01] understand you.\n[07:03] If you have an opinion, I don't have to\n[07:05] give one back. If you say something, I\n[07:08] can choose not to say anything at all.\n[07:10] And for a lot of people, that kind of\n[07:12] blows their mind of, \"You mean I don't\n[07:14] have to respond?\" No, you don't have to\n[07:16] say anything. If somebody's talking\n[07:18] really fast, you can talk really slow.\n[07:20] They forget that you have full autonomy\n[07:23] in it. And when you realize that it's\n[07:25] you who's taking the wheel, you take the\n[07:27] wheel of your life.\n[07:30] >> But what about justice, Jefferson?\n[07:32] >> Yeah.\n[07:33] >> Do you know justice? Like this person\n[07:35] has wronged me. They've said something\n[07:37] wrong. They've I don't know, they\n[07:39] tweeted at me something which is\n[07:40] incorrect. I need to correct the record.\n[07:42] Justice. I think we all have a sort of\n[07:44] an an innate sense of justice. We want\n[07:49] things to be fair and right.\n[07:50] >> Yes, justice is an inherent value that\n[07:54] is high priority for a lot of people for\n[07:56] good reason. You might say, well,\n[07:58] they've they've wronged me. This isn't\n[07:59] right. That's all well and good. The\n[08:02] question is going to be, how long do you\n[08:03] want to carry it? How long do you want\n[08:06] to carry that feeling? Because I can\n[08:08] either choose to let it go. I can choose\n[08:10] to say the thing. It's it's not at all\n[08:12] my position that you should be stepping\n[08:14] on eggshells and not say the thing and\n[08:17] be a wallflower. No, it's the opposite.\n[08:19] I'm saying you you say what you need to\n[08:21] say in a way that is controlled, in a\n[08:24] way that is signaling I don't I'm saying\n[08:27] this because it needs to be said, but\n[08:29] not because I have to say it. There's a\n[08:32] lot of people who feel like, well,\n[08:33] something needs to be said, but am I\n[08:36] maybe you're not the one to say it.\n[08:38] Maybe you you're the one that needs to\n[08:40] maybe needs doesn't need to be said\n[08:42] right now because if they're not willing\n[08:44] to listen, well then what good is it\n[08:46] ever do? What I like to say is, you\n[08:49] know, for you to learn how to stand up\n[08:52] for yourself, you first have to learn\n[08:54] who's worth getting out of your chair\n[08:55] for. I'm not going to be making big\n[08:58] moves for something that is not at all\n[09:02] worth my my time. So yeah, justice is\n[09:05] absolutely worth it. But when you go,\n[09:08] I'm the one that has to be carrying\n[09:09] this. A lot of the times people do\n[09:11] things to you and it's nothing to them,\n[09:14] but yet it's everything to you and now\n[09:16] you're just you're walking around for 20\n[09:18] years with a comment that you could have\n[09:20] said something way long ago and decided\n[09:22] to drop it, but you you chose to to\n[09:24] carry it and now you're the only one\n[09:26] that has the the weight of that. If I'm\n[09:28] dealing with someone who's in a position\n[09:29] of power, someone who's a I don't know a\n[09:32] senior to me at my company or even\n[09:34] someone who in my social group is a bit\n[09:36] more higher up in the sort of social\n[09:37] pecking order and they're continually\n[09:38] putting me down or being difficult or\n[09:40] even a partner that I'm romantically\n[09:42] involved in.\n[09:43] >> What are the hallmarks of someone who\n[09:45] has control over their communication?\n[09:46] And what are the hallmarks of someone\n[09:48] that doesn't like what is it that makes\n[09:50] because when you speak it's very feels\n[09:52] very composed and controlled. What are\n[09:54] you intentionally doing to achieve that\n[09:56] effect?\n[09:57] I'm wanting you to match my rhythm. I'm\n[10:00] wanting you to come to my frequency.\n[10:03] People get it wrong when they go big\n[10:04] time to an 11. Big emotional reaction.\n[10:07] If I have a big emotional outburst, am I\n[10:09] signaling that I'm somebody who's\n[10:11] trustworthy, reliable, and confident? Or\n[10:14] am I signaling that I am out of my\n[10:16] depth? I don't know what I want, and I\n[10:19] am not to be believed. Right? because\n[10:23] it's when you have an emotional\n[10:24] outburst, everybody thinks this is\n[10:26] you're just being emotional and they\n[10:28] don't all of a sudden you're not\n[10:30] credited for the truth of what you're\n[10:32] saying. So sometimes emotions can get in\n[10:35] the way of what needs to be said because\n[10:38] of how you're delivering it. So when I\n[10:40] say I'm going to talk to you in a way\n[10:42] that's going to sound more controlled,\n[10:44] it's I'm slowing down my words. I'm\n[10:46] lowering my volume. Why? Because I want\n[10:48] to pull you down here.\n[10:51] And if I can pull you down here, well\n[10:52] then we can talk about a lot harder\n[10:54] things rather than feeling like I have\n[10:57] to to rush. So if you want to talk to\n[10:59] somebody in your relationship or\n[11:00] somebody that's kind of higher up on the\n[11:02] pecking order, so to speak, when you can\n[11:05] show them that\n[11:07] change doesn't bother you, when you can\n[11:09] show them that you don't have to rush\n[11:13] through this situation, people feel that\n[11:17] you are giving them a sense of comfort.\n[11:19] In other words, in conversation,\n[11:21] everybody is looking for an anchor.\n[11:24] When you go to a meeting, we listen to\n[11:26] the person who's the anchor. They're\n[11:28] usually the person who says a lot less,\n[11:30] the person who's observing and listening\n[11:32] rather than always giving their opinion\n[11:34] about what you should be doing. Those\n[11:36] are the people you don't listen to. As\n[11:37] soon as you, if you've ever heard\n[11:39] somebody say, \"You know what I think you\n[11:40] should do?\" Does that ever make you want\n[11:42] to do what they said? No. It's because\n[11:44] they they've made it their idea. Now\n[11:47] they're telling you what to do. If I\n[11:49] were to say to you, you can't do that.\n[11:51] What's the first thing you think of?\n[11:53] Yes, I can.\n[11:55] >> You know, it's it's the same kind of\n[11:57] concept where it's me lowering to be the\n[12:00] anchor in the conversation.\n[12:01] >> And when you're in a case in front of a\n[12:04] judge, is is there anything else that\n[12:06] you're intentionally thinking about\n[12:07] with, I don't know, your body language\n[12:08] or the eye contact or any of these other\n[12:11] things that you've learned over time are\n[12:12] really important to get your message\n[12:14] heard?\n[12:15] >> I'm speaking like I've been there\n[12:16] before.\n[12:17] >> Explain that to me. walk into a room\n[12:19] like you've been there before, as if\n[12:21] everybody else is just visiting. So,\n[12:23] what I do before every trial is I will\n[12:26] go in there before the jury comes in,\n[12:29] the judge comes in, everybody comes in\n[12:31] and I say to myself, this is my living\n[12:34] room and everybody else is just\n[12:35] visiting. And so, I will touch the\n[12:38] chairs. I will put my hands on the\n[12:41] banisters. I will walk around. I will\n[12:43] feel that space and and feel it in a way\n[12:47] of saying I have been here before. And\n[12:50] when I can exude that kind of confidence\n[12:53] that every juror that watches,\n[12:56] all of a sudden it calms them down. They\n[12:57] go, who can I rely on here? Who's more\n[13:00] trustworthy? Who's more credible?\n[13:02] Because that's what it is when you're\n[13:03] when you're persuading, when you are\n[13:06] advocating your case, it's who\n[13:08] ultimately it comes down to who is more\n[13:10] credible. And so when I can\n[13:13] not get emotionally flustered, like I've\n[13:15] seen it so many times where a judge\n[13:19] rules against me\n[13:21] and I act as though that's exactly what\n[13:24] I wanted. You know, I am I'm acting as\n[13:27] though, thank you, judge. And the jur\n[13:30] the juryy's never going to know really\n[13:31] any different. But I've seen on other\n[13:34] attorneys where the judge rules against\n[13:35] them and they go [sighs]\n[13:38] or they roll their eyes or they act\n[13:39] frustrated. And what does the juror\n[13:41] think? Oh, they must not have wanted me\n[13:42] to hear this information or this must\n[13:45] have been bad for their case. So, if you\n[13:47] are always reacting to situations in\n[13:49] which you have to be emotional with in a\n[13:53] sense that you're not paying attention\n[13:55] to who's watching you.\n[13:57] >> Okay. On that point,\n[13:58] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[13:59] >> So, when you say rules against you, you\n[14:00] mean during the trial\n[14:02] >> there's something you request, the judge\n[14:04] might say no, and you say, \"Thank you,\n[14:05] judge.\"\n[14:06] >> You act as if\n[14:07] >> you're not defeated. you act as though\n[14:09] that's exactly what you expected, right?\n[14:11] It's it's the whole idea of that's not\n[14:14] going to shake shake me. So, a lot of\n[14:16] the times you'll see in real court, not\n[14:18] TV, uh the judge will say, \"Counsel, can\n[14:21] you approach?\" And both attorneys come\n[14:23] up and they play some kind of noise\n[14:25] cancellation to where only the the\n[14:26] attorneys can hear the judge and the\n[14:28] judge is making a decision at that time\n[14:30] that we don't want to hear to let the\n[14:31] jury know. Why? Because it's information\n[14:33] that might sway the case in some way and\n[14:36] not be as objective.\n[14:38] And you have to pay attention to who's\n[14:40] how the attorneys are walking away after\n[14:42] that meeting's done. If somebody looks\n[14:43] defeated, it just signals, oh, this is\n[14:46] information that they must not want or\n[14:49] they're objecting. I've seen so many\n[14:51] cases where there's one attorney who\n[14:54] objects to everything.\n[14:56] It's my rule if I really want to have\n[14:58] one objection the whole trial because to\n[15:01] the jury, an objection is me keeping\n[15:04] evidence out. So, if you always object,\n[15:06] always object, always object, you're\n[15:07] just signaling there's information I\n[15:09] don't want you to hear. But if I have\n[15:10] the confidence of knowing there's really\n[15:12] one objection I know that's going to be\n[15:14] material to my case,\n[15:16] that way they know I've been there\n[15:18] before. This is not something that's\n[15:20] going to be making or breaking my case.\n[15:23] It's it's all of credibility. If they\n[15:25] don't trust me, they're not going to\n[15:27] trust my client or my client's case.\n[15:29] >> I think also it illuminates to me how\n[15:31] much of a communication is nonverbal.\n[15:33] Because in that example, you're just\n[15:34] talking about how they're watching your\n[15:35] body language and how you've received\n[15:37] something,\n[15:38] >> right?\n[15:39] >> And the, you know, if you were\n[15:40] defensive, you know, with all those\n[15:42] objections or if you were defeated in\n[15:44] the judge's ruling,\n[15:46] >> that would work against you even though\n[15:48] it's really nothing was said, like\n[15:50] nothing significant was said.\n[15:52] >> Yeah. It's it's a balance of knowing\n[15:56] am I going to\n[15:59] choose to react because of personal ego\n[16:02] of I didn't get in my way or am I having\n[16:04] the better mindset of I'm advocating on\n[16:06] behalf of my client like I I've been\n[16:09] let's say you're a witness and you're\n[16:12] opposed to me and I'm asking you a\n[16:14] question and I think you said something\n[16:16] that's contrary contrary to the evidence\n[16:18] that I have right here rather than me\n[16:20] getting messed up saying are you are you\n[16:21] sure about that, Mr. Barl. Let me go.\n[16:23] You know, I have this piece of paper\n[16:24] here and I get really worked up versus\n[16:27] me putting you said something and I put\n[16:28] my hand on the the paper. I said, \"You\n[16:31] sure?\" Like all of a sudden, it's a\n[16:34] moment of it kind of peaks their\n[16:36] interest of like, \"What's happening? Oh,\n[16:37] this attorney knows. This attorney is\n[16:40] somebody who's confident and has this\n[16:43] what I call in the pocket presence. I'm\n[16:46] not trying to be too forward. I'm not\n[16:48] trying to be too pack. I'm just in the\n[16:49] pocket like a a jazz band.\" Like\n[16:51] everybody is on everybody's on beat and\n[16:54] so I'm not I'm not rushing. I'm not\n[16:56] slowing down. I'm just right in the\n[16:57] pocket.\n[16:58] >> In the pocket. Is that what people call\n[17:00] aura?\n[17:01] >> Swagger maybe as some people call it.\n[17:03] Yeah. Aura. You you could have it for\n[17:05] anything in any context. I like to say\n[17:07] in the pocket because it just reminds me\n[17:09] of\n[17:11] the right timing is my timing. And that\n[17:14] is I'm I'm going to match\n[17:16] how I need to be of what's most\n[17:19] authentic, what's most genuine to me. If\n[17:21] you were to ask me to read something\n[17:22] really fast, it wouldn't sound that\n[17:24] great because that's not that's not my\n[17:26] personality. And so if I know that I am\n[17:29] acting and speaking in accordance with\n[17:31] the values that I hold and I'm saying\n[17:33] everybody here is just is just visiting.\n[17:36] This is I've been here before. Let me\n[17:38] y'all don't know where to go. Let me\n[17:39] show you. And I I have that kind of\n[17:41] mentality,\n[17:43] people will listen to you forever.\n[17:46] They'll they'll find that attractive,\n[17:48] saying, \"How does this person know where\n[17:49] they're going? Well, I can I can follow\n[17:51] them.\" It's just it's natural leadership\n[17:53] to speak in a way that says, \"I know\n[17:55] where I've I'm going. I've been here\n[17:57] before.\"\n[17:58] >> I think that's probably good advice for\n[17:59] people who um have important meetings or\n[18:02] are going on dates.\n[18:03] >> Yeah.\n[18:03] >> To maybe get there ahead of time and\n[18:05] familiarize yourself with the location.\n[18:07] >> Yes. just so you you know you don't have\n[18:09] the added anxiety of like stumbling\n[18:11] through the physical environment like\n[18:13] looking for the thing or trying to find\n[18:14] the toilet or\n[18:16] >> I don't know trying to figure out how to\n[18:17] make the PowerPoint presentation airdrop\n[18:19] onto the screen and all those kinds of\n[18:20] things which we've all seen before.\n[18:22] >> Yeah. I always anytime I go to speak um\n[18:24] I I spoke this past week uh in Santa\n[18:27] Barbara.\n[18:28] >> I went ahead of time before my speaking\n[18:30] time to to go I want to see what the\n[18:32] room looks like. I want to see how how\n[18:34] can I touch and say hi to the people\n[18:36] that are working AV. How can I meet\n[18:38] them? How can I if you really want to be\n[18:40] better as a professional speaker? Talk\n[18:42] to people in the crowd before you speak.\n[18:45] >> Get to know people's names. It's going\n[18:46] to naturally lower you. Get to know\n[18:49] their names. Ask them why they're here.\n[18:51] Say, \"I'm so thankful that you're here.\n[18:52] I'm really looking forward to the\n[18:54] message and getting to talk to you\n[18:55] today.\" when you when you can go in and\n[18:57] touch people, it's a different sense\n[19:00] than if I'm going into a room totally\n[19:02] cold because you don't really have the\n[19:03] vibe. You don't really know how that is.\n[19:05] So, yeah, going into a restaurant ahead\n[19:06] of time, that's great. Not bringing your\n[19:08] phone, even better. You know, getting\n[19:10] able to be a sense of knowing\n[19:14] I I've been here before. I want to\n[19:16] welcome you to to my space. When we talk\n[19:19] about um people that have aura, you must\n[19:21] have met a lot of people in your career\n[19:22] and your life generally that you felt\n[19:24] had a sense of aura.\n[19:26] >> Yes.\n[19:27] >> What was it about them that gave them\n[19:30] that aura? What is it? It's a frequency\n[19:34] of\n[19:36] peace for me. I think of people and you\n[19:40] think of people in your life who you\n[19:43] have felt most\n[19:45] comfortable with. the person you feel\n[19:47] like I I can just be myself. I can\n[19:49] finally let everything down. Like for\n[19:51] me, it was my my grandparents house. As\n[19:54] soon as I walk in, it's a different\n[19:56] feeling of time kind of stands still.\n[20:00] They want to know about me. They want to\n[20:02] know how am I doing? They It's It's that\n[20:05] feeling. I could talk about people who\n[20:07] seem like they have aura and they just\n[20:09] have a a glow about them. It's usually\n[20:12] of they're not trying to prove anything\n[20:14] to anybody. They just naturally exude\n[20:18] that kind of charisma because of the\n[20:21] security of knowing who they are and\n[20:24] what they can do. And I guess what\n[20:26] what's the opposite of that then?\n[20:28] Sometimes it's easier to understand\n[20:29] something by understanding the opposite.\n[20:31] What would that look like?\n[20:33] >> I would say that\n[20:35] authentic people,\n[20:37] authentic aura as you said, doesn't come\n[20:41] from people\n[20:43] securing themselves to you. That's for\n[20:46] insecure people.\n[20:48] The people who are authentic know that I\n[20:52] am good exactly where I'm at. Oh, you\n[20:54] want to rush? I'm I'm in really no rush.\n[20:56] I'm What happens today happens today. Is\n[20:59] it really due today or could it be done\n[21:02] tomorrow if I I had to? if it's a slower\n[21:05] pace. I I find that there is so much\n[21:08] kind of what they call cowboy wisdom on\n[21:11] these kind of things where and I'm from\n[21:14] Texas in the south. So it's it's kind of\n[21:15] this\n[21:17] knowing that the right time will come\n[21:19] when that time is right and not having\n[21:22] to push that. So if you want to look at\n[21:23] the opposite, it's the it's the opposite\n[21:26] of aura is insecure. It's named\n[21:30] dropping. It's having to be friends\n[21:32] immediately. It's having to prove to you\n[21:35] how much money I have or what. It's\n[21:37] everything else\n[21:40] being everything to everybody else\n[21:41] except myself.\n[21:44] Like people who have a sense of style,\n[21:46] their own sense of style naturally have\n[21:48] an aura. Why? Because they don't care\n[21:50] what in the world anybody else is\n[21:51] wearing. This is what I like. My\n[21:54] daughter, all right, she's six. We tried\n[21:57] setting out clothes. Forget [snorts] it.\n[21:59] She she can come down in a leopard print\n[22:03] tutu and her sunglasses and whatever she\n[22:05] wants. And you know what? She thinks she\n[22:06] is the flyest thing in the world. I mean\n[22:08] that's I never want to take that out of\n[22:11] her. The people who have a sense of\n[22:13] fashion, a sense of who I am and they\n[22:17] didn't have to look cool to anybody\n[22:18] social standard, but it's do they really\n[22:21] care what anybody else thinks? Usually\n[22:23] the people with aura do not. Mhm.\n[22:27] >> And sometimes when you come up against I\n[22:30] mean we were talking before we started\n[22:31] recording about since this book's\n[22:34] publication what have been people saying\n[22:36] to you what have the chapters um what\n[22:38] are the chapters that have stood out the\n[22:39] most to people and you mentioned that it\n[22:40] tends to be things around dealing with\n[22:43] difficult conversations dealing with\n[22:44] difficult people.\n[22:46] >> Right.\n[22:46] >> And one of the phrases that's been\n[22:48] arguably overused a lot in society is\n[22:50] this phrase gaslighting.\n[22:52] >> Yeah. And the definition of gaslighting\n[22:54] that I managed to pull was gaslighting\n[22:56] is psychological manipulation where one\n[22:58] person purposefully lies or manipulates\n[23:00] the other to make them doubt their own\n[23:02] reality, memory, or sanity.\n[23:04] >> Mhm.\n[23:04] >> Do people talk to you about gaslighting\n[23:06] a lot?\n[23:07] >> Yes.\n[23:07] >> Now that you've written this book?\n[23:08] >> Yes.\n[23:09] >> And what do you think gaslighting? It's\n[23:11] one of those things that's been used so\n[23:12] often that we almost have to like pause\n[23:13] for a second just to define it again.\n[23:15] >> Yes. Well, let me put it this way. The\n[23:17] difference between\n[23:19] gaslighting and lying. Lying is a\n[23:22] surface level of\n[23:27] I could tell you instead of having a\n[23:28] silver cup, this is a red cup. Well,\n[23:30] that would be a lie. Gaslighting is I'm\n[23:34] trying to alter your reality into mine.\n[23:38] I'm I'm trying to make you question how\n[23:41] other people perceive you, including\n[23:43] myself. How you perceive yourself. If\n[23:46] anybody's ever questioned, \"Am I crazy?\n[23:48] Am I the crazy one? Is it Is it me? Is\n[23:51] it is everybody most likely you're\n[23:53] probably being gas and here's the truth.\n[23:57] I have been the gaslighter.\n[24:00] Everybody has been the gaslighter\n[24:02] whether they intentionally know it or\n[24:04] not. Because it's all that feeling of\n[24:07] preservation of defensiveness of I don't\n[24:10] want people to know the truth of of\n[24:12] what's happening in my life so I'm going\n[24:14] to mislead. In gaslighting, the intent\n[24:17] is to alter your reality, to make you\n[24:20] question what is real and what is not.\n[24:25] So, I might do something wrong and then\n[24:26] I might come home and know that I've\n[24:28] done something wrong and intentionally\n[24:30] try and sell my partner a version of\n[24:32] reality that makes them fundamentally\n[24:34] question what they know to try and spare\n[24:36] me\n[24:36] >> the critique or to control them.\n[24:40] >> Yes. To protect yourself. It's it's it's\n[24:43] selfpreservation.\n[24:44] Say, let's say you and your partner had\n[24:46] come home from a a dinner, all right?\n[24:48] And you're just in a very critical mood\n[24:50] and maybe you're trying to to distract\n[24:53] from something else that's going on in\n[24:54] your life and you're being critical of a\n[24:57] story that she shared at dinner and\n[24:59] you're like, why did you why would you\n[25:01] ever say that? And she goes, everything\n[25:03] was fine. You're like, fine. No, no, it\n[25:05] was not. Did you not see how they\n[25:06] reacted? No, no, no, no. Listen, I know\n[25:10] you don't want to hear this, but\n[25:12] everybody feels that, you know, you're a\n[25:15] little bit much. You and I and I'm I'm\n[25:18] the one that needs to tell you this. You\n[25:20] see how you're all of a sudden is\n[25:21] starting to alter how she feels in that\n[25:24] moment. And I've seen the the other side\n[25:26] of that. And it is it is not at all\n[25:29] something that you can come back from\n[25:31] without serious relationship work to be\n[25:35] able to find a way to say okay what's\n[25:38] how are we really walking in truth\n[25:40] because you get so far away from radical\n[25:42] honesty in conversation. So gaslighting\n[25:44] is is is not something to be taken\n[25:47] lightly. But I will say people often\n[25:48] apply to the wrong thing. They'll use it\n[25:51] as a sense of saying you're saying\n[25:54] something I don't like so you're\n[25:55] gaslighting me. You know, we're in an\n[25:57] argument and you're pointing out\n[25:58] something that hurt your feelings. Oh,\n[25:59] that's gaslighting, you know, and and\n[26:01] they they they use it as an excuse.\n[26:03] >> It's almost a form of gaslighting.\n[26:05] >> Exactly. That's exactly right. And it in\n[26:08] a weird way, it can reverse that way.\n[26:09] But imagine me saying something hurtful\n[26:11] to you and you go, \"That really hurt my\n[26:13] feelings.\" I go, \"That's just my\n[26:14] boundary. I just I have a boundary about\n[26:15] everything.\" Or, \"This is you're just\n[26:17] gaslighting me.\" You know, I've never\n[26:18] met somebody who talked about their ex\n[26:21] without saying my narcissistic ex. you\n[26:24] know, I finally just got out of a\n[26:25] narcissistic relationship. It's never\n[26:27] us, right? It's always the other It's\n[26:29] always the other person. And so, there's\n[26:30] these words that we can kind of pepper\n[26:33] insult into sentences that are also\n[26:36] still another form if we look at it, a\n[26:38] form of self-preservation. Look at all\n[26:40] their bad and don't look at mine.\n[26:42] >> Why is it important that we don't\n[26:43] gaslight others? And I asked this\n[26:45] question because everybody listening now\n[26:47] is probably going to want the answer to\n[26:48] the question, which is what what do I do\n[26:50] about a gaslighter? Yeah. Yeah,\n[26:51] >> but this is avoiding the responsibility\n[26:54] that we all have a like a tendency or at\n[26:58] some point in our life have gaslighted\n[26:59] somebody else\n[27:01] >> and you know I don't think my audience\n[27:04] is just the gaslighted [laughter]\n[27:08] >> statistically clearly you're also all\n[27:09] the gaslighters\n[27:10] >> right\n[27:11] >> so how do um why is it important that we\n[27:14] don't gaslight other people and is there\n[27:15] a way for us to avoid\n[27:18] you know getting into a situation where\n[27:19] our back's against the wall and we end\n[27:20] up gaslighting one,\n[27:22] >> it's important not to gaslight somebody\n[27:25] because every time you do, you're\n[27:28] removing\n[27:29] yourself further and further from the\n[27:31] truth, the truth of how you feel, the\n[27:34] truth of your relationship. You are\n[27:36] withholding\n[27:38] reality from that other person rather\n[27:40] than having radical radical honesty\n[27:42] about what's what's happening. So it it\n[27:45] degrades the relationship. It degrades\n[27:47] another person's selfworth. And in many\n[27:49] ways, gaslighting steals their reality.\n[27:55] It's not something you can give back\n[27:57] without a lot of work. It it's it's\n[28:00] taking in some sense. Now, it can be\n[28:02] absolutely\n[28:04] intentional and it can also be\n[28:06] unintentional as a form of\n[28:07] self-preservation.\n[28:09] And if you feel like you are being\n[28:12] gaslit,\n[28:13] the secret to knowing is slowing down\n[28:17] the conversation.\n[28:19] If I am staying still in the\n[28:23] conversation, meaning you could say\n[28:25] something to me that's a form of\n[28:27] gaslighting, making me question, did I\n[28:29] oh my goodness, did I really say that?\n[28:30] Did I really hurt their feelings? No, I\n[28:31] did I and get into my head and I start\n[28:35] kind of jumping around and trying to\n[28:37] change what I did. But if I were to say,\n[28:40] \"Stephen, I remember that differently.\"\n[28:43] And that's where I stop.\n[28:46] Then you can try other things. And I'm\n[28:47] going to repeat, \"Yeah, I remember that\n[28:50] differently.\"\n[28:51] It's standing in the truth of what you\n[28:53] know rather than being concerned\n[28:57] and misled\n[28:58] by giving someone the reins and the\n[29:00] leash to drag you around.\n[29:03] And if I um if I think about I think\n[29:06] it's thinking about all the times where\n[29:07] I've I think I might have gas gas gas\n[29:08] gas lit someone you know in\n[29:10] relationships backs against the wall um\n[29:13] and you're having an argument with\n[29:15] someone or\n[29:17] >> it's quite difficult in my head to know\n[29:18] the difference between the word like\n[29:19] just tell saying something that isn't\n[29:21] necessarily true or is that is your\n[29:22] perception of things versus like\n[29:24] gaslighting\n[29:26] >> is the is the difference in your mind\n[29:27] intention\n[29:28] >> like is if I if I give my version of\n[29:30] reality\n[29:31] >> yeah We were at that party. You said\n[29:34] this thing. I saw the person roll their\n[29:36] eyes and then they walked away. I think\n[29:37] they're really offended. I think you\n[29:38] offended them,\n[29:39] >> right?\n[29:39] >> What's the difference between that and\n[29:41] me gaslighting someone\n[29:43] >> of between lying and gaslighting or it's\n[29:45] >> Yeah. Like I'm trying to understand in\n[29:47] in that context you gave about going to\n[29:48] a party, someone said something and then\n[29:50] they walk up. What's the difference\n[29:51] between if that's how you saw reality\n[29:54] and you're communicating it versus\n[29:55] gaslighting someone?\n[29:56] >> It to the intention.\n[29:58] >> It's the intention. The tension is I'm\n[30:00] the one in control, not you.\n[30:02] >> Okay.\n[30:03] >> So, you are trying to control the\n[30:05] narrative. You are trying to be both\n[30:08] director, producer, and actor\n[30:10] >> for your own agenda.\n[30:11] >> That's right. For your own film\n[30:13] >> and for control.\n[30:14] >> I'm I'm the character in my own movie.\n[30:16] I'm the main character. And you need to\n[30:20] behave this way. You need to believe\n[30:22] this. You need to act upon that. And so\n[30:25] the more I can try to manipulate that\n[30:29] reality\n[30:31] and what's so wild is it becomes so\n[30:34] manipulated that you believe it too. Now\n[30:37] now that that falsehood has now become\n[30:40] your fact in some sense that the really\n[30:42] good liars convince themselves that that\n[30:45] lie is is the truth. Is there a certain\n[30:48] type of person that's more susceptible\n[30:50] to being gaslit or to being victimized\n[30:53] in any way with conversation in your\n[30:54] view?\n[30:55] >> Anxious attachment. The ones that are\n[30:57] they\n[30:59] people who can't regulate by themselves,\n[31:01] they have to co-regulate.\n[31:03] Meaning\n[31:05] most of the time men are were good\n[31:09] self-regulators. Just give me some time\n[31:12] by myself. Give me an evening. Give me\n[31:16] an hour. Let me walk outside. I'll and\n[31:18] I'll regulate myself.\n[31:21] Most of the time, it's been my\n[31:22] experience. Women are not like that.\n[31:24] They co-regulate most of them. They they\n[31:27] need you to also make them feel good.\n[31:30] They can't be good if you're not good.\n[31:32] We're not good. I'm not good if if\n[31:34] you're not okay. So, it's it's that\n[31:36] whole I'm not okay if you're not okay.\n[31:38] And so in many ways they need you to be\n[31:42] able to calm down themselves and they\n[31:46] they don't self-regulate as well. And so\n[31:50] the people who are most susceptible to\n[31:52] gaslighting are ones who need\n[31:54] co-regulation.\n[31:55] People who are anxious anxious\n[31:57] attachment meaning they they need uh are\n[32:01] you okay? Are you good? Do you need\n[32:02] anything? Are you sure you're not okay?\n[32:04] and versus the people who are more\n[32:08] avoidant and three the the people who\n[32:10] are are typically more insecure.\n[32:12] >> So do you think women get gas lit more\n[32:13] than men?\n[32:14] >> Yes.\n[32:17] >> But women still gaslight women, right?\n[32:19] >> Of course.\n[32:20] >> But just men are more\n[32:21] >> when you're talking relationships. When\n[32:23] you're talking relationships, that's my\n[32:24] personal opinion is because from my\n[32:26] feedback from the people that have read\n[32:29] my book and the people who give me\n[32:31] feedback on my book, Yeah. It's majority\n[32:34] vast majority are are women. I'm not\n[32:36] saying that's some empirical study on\n[32:38] it. But what I will say is\n[32:42] women are just as capable of gaslighting\n[32:48] and gas women can certainly gaslight\n[32:49] women. And it's I I'm saying this with\n[32:53] the mindset of everybody gaslights\n[32:56] whether they know it or not. And they\n[32:58] have in the past. Most likely they can\n[32:59] think of a time in the past where they\n[33:01] did without knowing it. But it is that\n[33:05] would be my opinion that most of the\n[33:07] time men are the ones that do it to\n[33:09] women.\n[33:09] >> Just reading some research here that\n[33:11] says multiple studies on emotional abuse\n[33:12] in heterosexual relationships show women\n[33:14] report higher rates of gaslighting and\n[33:16] coercive control than men. Men do report\n[33:19] gaslighting too, but less frequently and\n[33:21] usually in different forms. Um, and as\n[33:24] it relates to workplace data, surveys\n[33:26] from management and organizational\n[33:27] psychology show women are more likely to\n[33:29] have their competence questioned, their\n[33:30] memory doubted, or their experience\n[33:33] dismissed.\n[33:35] Women in male-dominated fields report\n[33:37] the highest rates of gaslighting, and\n[33:39] women of color report even higher rates\n[33:41] of being told their perception is wrong\n[33:43] or misinterpret or that they're\n[33:44] misinterpreting things.\n[33:47] >> Sounds like that tracks.\n[33:50] And also in medical settings, women are\n[33:52] less likely to be to be believed about\n[33:54] their symptoms. Women's pain is\n[33:56] underestimated. Women get later\n[33:58] diagnoses for multiple conditions like\n[34:00] heart disease and autoimmune disorders,\n[34:01] ADHD and autism. And the list goes on\n[34:04] and on and on. If I had to say who does\n[34:08] more, you know, I'm not trying to put\n[34:10] some kind of like headline of men do it\n[34:13] more than women. In my experience, it\n[34:16] tends to be the guy. And you know what\n[34:18] does that that information show me? It\n[34:22] shows me that that sounds about right. I\n[34:26] do think from the people that follow my\n[34:28] content, listen to my content because I\n[34:30] stay very connected to my community of\n[34:34] so many women say I feel like I'm in\n[34:36] this workplace and they are doubting my\n[34:38] competence. They're doubting my ability\n[34:39] to make decisions. I'm not being\n[34:42] believed. I'm putting I'm I'm being put\n[34:44] down. I'm whether it's not even their\n[34:46] experience. it's just because of their\n[34:49] gender. And those are real those are\n[34:52] real questions. Does that mean that\n[34:53] that's gaslighting? Probably not all the\n[34:56] time. But for me to say, ah, that's\n[34:59] that's a dumb complaint. Uh, you know,\n[35:01] that's just complaining. In many ways,\n[35:03] when you start denying that reality,\n[35:05] then you have the same problem. Do you\n[35:07] know I am I've I've hired thousands of\n[35:08] people over the last decade and I have\n[35:12] to say sometimes it's it's difficult to\n[35:15] understand the plight of someone else\n[35:16] when you haven't lived their experience\n[35:18] like you haven't been a woman or\n[35:20] whatever. It's like very difficult. So,\n[35:22] you kind of just have to take them for\n[35:23] their word sometimes if you've not lived\n[35:24] it yourself or you can look at data or\n[35:26] whatever else.\n[35:27] >> And I do have to say that I have\n[35:29] experienced\n[35:31] >> male executives who were\n[35:35] extremely dismissive of their female\n[35:37] peers in a way that was 100%\n[35:41] inconsistent as it relates to genders.\n[35:43] What I mean by that is I can think of\n[35:45] several male executives over the years\n[35:47] who I observed\n[35:50] dismissing or diminishing or not giving\n[35:52] the woman in the room the same credit\n[35:54] really for no other reason than she was\n[35:56] a woman. And so it's a very real thing.\n[35:58] And it's not every man, I have to say\n[36:00] this, but there is a certain particular\n[36:01] type of person\n[36:03] >> who for some reason in my experience\n[36:06] would see a woman in the in the\n[36:08] workplace or in the high sort of upper\n[36:09] echelons of the professional um uh\n[36:11] environment as being less than them just\n[36:14] because of her gender. So when I hear,\n[36:16] you know, what you're saying about women\n[36:18] are predominantly come, you know, coming\n[36:19] to you talking about these issues of\n[36:20] gaslighting, it does kind of track with\n[36:22] what I've seen. I'll tell you this. I've\n[36:24] never had a man come to me in all this\n[36:27] time that I've been from my book to my\n[36:29] content this number of years ever say I\n[36:31] think I'm being gaslit. It is it has\n[36:34] always been the woman.\n[36:36] >> Never.\n[36:37] >> Never.\n[36:38] >> What about the conversation around like\n[36:40] dealing with narcissists? Cuz this feels\n[36:41] like it's kind of one and the same. The\n[36:43] words are used in the same sort of\n[36:45] vernacular but\n[36:46] >> Yeah.\n[36:47] >> Do you have men coming to you saying\n[36:48] that I think my partner's a narcissist?\n[36:50] Yes, you do.\n[36:50] >> Yeah, that I do have. Yeah, it's always\n[36:53] it's always they're married to one or\n[36:56] just got out of a relationship with one,\n[36:57] but it's never them.\n[36:59] >> And what what do you say to someone who\n[37:00] is dealing with an artist who is dealing\n[37:02] with someone who repeatedly gas\n[37:03] gaslights them? Let's say it's in the\n[37:04] context of work.\n[37:05] >> Yeah.\n[37:06] >> What are they meant to do? Quit their\n[37:08] job.\n[37:09] >> Well, that is an option. So, let's not\n[37:11] rule that out.\n[37:12] >> Okay.\n[37:12] >> Um if it's if it's worth it to you\n[37:14] because that's that's the question of\n[37:16] what's your what's your purpose here?\n[37:17] And this is where you're going to be\n[37:18] forever. Then there's some things we\n[37:21] need to put in place. But what are you\n[37:23] to do? You are to limit the interaction\n[37:26] like limit the exposure. Talk less\n[37:29] neutral statements.\n[37:32] So if you can many ways you can just\n[37:36] limit the amount of physicality of I\n[37:38] don't have to see you. I don't have to\n[37:40] communicate with you. I know you work\n[37:42] three doors down but I don't have to be\n[37:45] your best friend and you certainly don't\n[37:47] have to be mine. Two is understanding\n[37:49] the game that you're in. It's a it's a\n[37:52] game for narcissists of praise or\n[37:54] provoke. Meaning, if I am not showering\n[37:58] you with praise, then the narcissist\n[38:01] will turn to provoke in order to create\n[38:03] an argument for the same effect. They\n[38:06] they delight in frustration just as may\n[38:08] just as much as they delight in your\n[38:10] praise because they get the same type of\n[38:13] control. I have seen so many expert\n[38:16] witnesses in my field that are that I\n[38:19] what I would term are narcissists. They\n[38:21] they they can never possibly be wrong.\n[38:24] They they don't do empathy. And again,\n[38:27] this is me with the understanding of\n[38:30] hey, we all have narcissistic\n[38:31] tendencies. You know, we all have\n[38:33] narcissistic traits and narcissism is a\n[38:36] diagnosible condition that you can have.\n[38:38] I think more people would qualify more\n[38:41] than they think. But how do you handle\n[38:43] it daytoday is know knowing what kind of\n[38:46] game you're in and it's a game you're\n[38:47] just not going to play. I know I don't\n[38:49] have to say anything to that person.\n[38:50] Two, I'm going to limit my distance to\n[38:53] them. And three, I'm going to use\n[38:55] neutral statements. I'm going to use\n[38:57] neutral statements like that's good to\n[38:58] know. Thanks for sharing. Noted and\n[39:02] things that they can't grab on to and\n[39:04] continue to have in a conversation. When\n[39:07] you think of like the hallmarks of of of\n[39:09] a really really one of these types of\n[39:12] people, what are the way the\n[39:14] characteristics that I could should be\n[39:15] looking out for? If I'm dealing with one\n[39:18] such person who is is going to try and\n[39:19] manipulate me, it's going to try and\n[39:21] gaslight me. What what do they do? They\n[39:25] can never be happy for anybody but\n[39:27] themselves.\n[39:29] They can't be happy for you. They can't\n[39:30] be happy for other people. These are the\n[39:33] type that if you were to say, \"Hey, did\n[39:35] you see that Stephen just got this\n[39:36] award? Isn't that so great? You just\n[39:38] nominated for whatever.\" And they go, \"I\n[39:39] mean, that's I guess that's fine. You\n[39:41] know, I when I did this,\" and they start\n[39:43] talking about themselves.\n[39:45] They can never be happy for somebody\n[39:46] else. They can't be happy for you. It's\n[39:49] they have to find some way to turn the\n[39:51] conversation of why the world is so hard\n[39:54] and so pitiful for them that the world\n[39:56] was against them and they couldn't get\n[39:57] it, but they were just as deserving. I\n[39:59] mean, I guess that's fine. And I mean,\n[40:01] you know, I do this, but nobody nobody\n[40:03] listens. Nobody really cares. They find\n[40:04] that they have a very victim mentality.\n[40:07] So, two is a victim mentality.\n[40:08] Everything happens to them in some way.\n[40:11] And three, they can't feel for other\n[40:13] people. They don't do emotion. It's it's\n[40:18] always about the perception of what\n[40:20] others would think. They're very very\n[40:24] sensitive to how others might portray\n[40:27] them. So, they're going to give you a\n[40:28] different view than they give other\n[40:31] people. And so, the couple might be\n[40:33] terrible,\n[40:35] but for a narcissist, they're going to\n[40:37] put on face that the relationship is\n[40:38] perfect to everybody else. And everybody\n[40:40] goes, \"You you must be so blessed to be\n[40:42] married to that person.\" And you're\n[40:43] going, \"You kidding me? They're they're\n[40:46] fooling everybody.\" And it's a very\n[40:47] helpless position.\n[40:48] >> Have you ever had a narcissist try and\n[40:50] pray on you?\n[40:51] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in the legal\n[40:54] field, man. Expert witnesses have\n[40:57] opinions to them that are\n[40:59] unquestionable. You can't this is their\n[41:01] opinion and nobody else could ever argue\n[41:03] with it when I have another expert who\n[41:05] says just the opposite. So a lot of the\n[41:07] times they are very condescending\n[41:11] you know that's fine and they have their\n[41:13] opinion and this is all there is and how\n[41:16] dumb of you to ever question me. And\n[41:18] usually what gives it away is if I feel\n[41:22] like this is somebody that okay they're\n[41:24] they can't be reasonable. They're never\n[41:26] going to give an inch on what's\n[41:27] reasonable.\n[41:29] I will ask this. I'll say this is\n[41:31] typically in a deposition. I'll say and\n[41:33] you think the juryy's going to like\n[41:34] that.\n[41:35] And or you think other people are going\n[41:37] to agree with you and all of a sudden\n[41:39] they kind of change in an instant to be\n[41:42] able to match what the jury is going to\n[41:44] think. So, if I were to say, and you\n[41:46] think and you think that's okay, and you\n[41:47] think others are going to find that\n[41:48] okay, and you think that the jury when\n[41:50] they hear this, they're they're all\n[41:52] going to agree with this very hardline\n[41:55] opinion. I've seen it every time. Or\n[41:58] they that's it's only when I reference\n[42:00] other people, the presentation of\n[42:03] themselves to other people that they\n[42:05] kind of put on a a show.\n[42:07] >> Why?\n[42:08] because they know that\n[42:11] the perception of the crowd is\n[42:15] everything. They need everybody to like\n[42:17] them, to fawn over them. They they want\n[42:20] their idea to to be the best. And so\n[42:23] they will manipulate the situation to be\n[42:25] the chameleon to to make sure that\n[42:27] everybody loves them at least in in\n[42:30] their mind. It's not a it's not a\n[42:32] reasonable thought. So they will\n[42:34] typically change their opinion to sound\n[42:36] more palatable even though they could\n[42:38] have admitted to that you know two hours\n[42:41] into the deposition.\n[42:42] >> Do they tend to talk more or less than\n[42:44] the average person in the room?\n[42:45] >> Much more.\n[42:48] >> Is there a thin line between just being\n[42:49] insecure and being a narcissist? Because\n[42:52] you know one of the things I was\n[42:53] thinking about is you said earlier that\n[42:54] they tend to bring everything back to\n[42:55] themselves. And I was thinking about all\n[42:57] the people that I know that if we were\n[42:59] having a conversation about your book\n[43:00] doing really really well, the first\n[43:02] response to that would be their mention\n[43:05] of their own book like they would\n[43:06] immediately bring it straight back to\n[43:07] something about them. And I was\n[43:08] wondering some of those people I just\n[43:09] have in the category of just being a\n[43:10] little bit insecure and that they just,\n[43:13] you know, they're a search for\n[43:14] validation. So I'm wondering where where\n[43:16] you think the line might be between sort\n[43:18] of narcissistic behavior and just like\n[43:20] extremely insecure. Maybe there's not a\n[43:22] line. Maybe extreme insecurity is\n[43:23] narcissism.\n[43:24] >> Both can be true. You know, I' I'd say\n[43:26] that\n[43:28] not all insecure people are narcissists,\n[43:30] but all narcissists are insecure.\n[43:32] [clears throat]\n[43:32] >> Um, I would I would say that if I had to\n[43:36] give some kind of line, it would be the\n[43:40] interest for growth.\n[43:43] Insecure people are looking for ways to\n[43:45] grow and to secure and attach.\n[43:48] Narcissists, they're not looking for\n[43:50] anybody to attach on to. They're looking\n[43:54] for people to support them, you know, to\n[43:57] please them. And so it they have no\n[44:00] interest in growth. They to them they've\n[44:03] learned all they've have to learn. I I\n[44:05] am the best. I I cannot improve anymore.\n[44:07] That to me would be the difference.\n[44:09] >> When you dealt with narcissists in your\n[44:11] own life and in the courtroom,\n[44:14] what is the reason why they couldn't\n[44:15] prey on you? What did you do as defense\n[44:18] to stop their games, their typical games\n[44:20] working on you? I don't chase their\n[44:23] words.\n[44:26] Often, one of the biggest things I see\n[44:27] wrong in conversation\n[44:31] is a narcissist will, same for a\n[44:32] gaslighter, they'll dig a hole. All\n[44:35] right? And then they expect you to fill\n[44:38] it.\n[44:39] Meaning, they're going to say something\n[44:41] to frustrate you and you go, \"No, no,\n[44:42] that's not what happened. Don't you\n[44:43] remember?\" and you start chasing it and\n[44:45] then they just dig another hole and you\n[44:48] keep going and you keep going and you're\n[44:50] exhausted because all you've been doing\n[44:51] is trying to plug holes. You're not\n[44:53] having a real conversation.\n[44:55] And when I can give it a very clear\n[44:58] definition, a very clear signal of\n[45:02] noted, you know, I'm just going to stay\n[45:04] right there. I'm going to see I'm going\n[45:06] to put down the shovel and stay right\n[45:09] there with them. and maybe I'll say\n[45:11] something as neutral as got it. I don't\n[45:15] have to chase it. I don't have to say\n[45:16] anything. And and to me, the the people\n[45:20] that have those narcissistic traits,\n[45:22] once they realize that they're going to\n[45:23] have no game with you, that you're not\n[45:25] going to play, they find somebody else.\n[45:28] They find somebody. If you've ever had\n[45:30] somebody come to you and they're the\n[45:33] more emotionally toxic type of person,\n[45:36] they always have some kind of problem.\n[45:37] They come with you and they have this\n[45:38] problem. and you go, I I just I can't\n[45:39] right this moment. I will. And 10\n[45:42] minutes later, what's happened? They\n[45:43] don't have that issue. They've already\n[45:44] gone to talk to somebody else.\n[45:46] >> I was watching uh Dame Dash on the\n[45:48] Breakfast Club. I don't know if you've\n[45:50] seen it, [laughter]\n[45:51] >> but it's really\n[45:51] >> another Breakfast Club,\n[45:52] >> but it's it's Dame Dash is on there\n[45:54] because he he was um he filed for\n[45:56] bankruptcy and Charlemagne is sat there\n[45:58] >> and Charlemagne [clears throat] is I've\n[46:00] actually interviewed both of them, both\n[46:01] Dame and Charlemagne. And Charlemagne is\n[46:04] very relaxed and every once in a while\n[46:07] just tells Dame Dash that he thinks he's\n[46:09] broke. And then Dame Dash is like very\n[46:13] like hotaded and like trying to prove\n[46:15] prove all the reasons why he's not broke\n[46:16] and like really like you know gassing\n[46:18] him. And I it was it was an interesting\n[46:20] it's an interesting video to watch. I\n[46:22] think it's the more recent one that came\n[46:23] out within the last year because it does\n[46:26] show in my view how to deal with someone\n[46:28] who has a very has a significant ego.\n[46:33] >> Yeah.\n[46:33] >> Which is Charlemagne just never changes\n[46:36] state. Like no matter what the volume\n[46:38] is, no matter how much emotion, no\n[46:40] matter when he starts calling him some\n[46:43] quite personal insults, Charlemagne's\n[46:46] demeanor, his tone, his posture,\n[46:49] >> yeah,\n[46:49] >> doesn't change.\n[46:50] >> Unbothered. unbothered. And you can see\n[46:52] it's super triggering that you just\n[46:54] can't get to this guy. Like it looks\n[46:56] like Dame is like really annoyed that he\n[46:57] and he tries to say more offensive\n[46:58] things. He calls you're a you're this,\n[47:00] you're that, the other.\n[47:01] >> And it's funny cuz I was watching it\n[47:02] this morning and it for me it kind of\n[47:04] tracks with a lot of the stuff you're\n[47:06] saying about like just not going with\n[47:07] them.\n[47:07] >> Yeah.\n[47:08] >> Just not following them where because\n[47:10] they want you to go somewhere and\n[47:12] there's a certain conflict they want to\n[47:14] get in with you and if you just kind of\n[47:15] refuse and just stay anchored to\n[47:17] whatever your point of view is, it's\n[47:18] it's funny to watch. They want to push\n[47:20] you.\n[47:21] >> Yeah.\n[47:21] >> Yeah. My my dad I can remember growing\n[47:24] up I'd be in the passenger seat. He's\n[47:26] driving\n[47:28] >> and you ever had it where somebody\n[47:30] you're in the passenger seat and\n[47:31] somebody's just rearing the bumper right\n[47:34] on them\n[47:34] >> and and I and I'd be looking in the side\n[47:36] mirror. I'm like I kind of start\n[47:38] stressing out for him. You know,\n[47:40] somebody's really riding the bumper, you\n[47:42] know, right behind him.\n[47:43] >> And I mean just like clockwork. what he\n[47:46] would do, we have shoulders on our in on\n[47:48] the roads there in Texas, and rather\n[47:51] than trying to speed up or get mad, he\n[47:53] would just kind of pull over to the\n[47:54] shoulder and he would say this every\n[47:55] time. He'd say, \"Go on with your bad\n[47:57] self.\" Every time he go, \"Go on with\n[47:59] your bad self in the rearview mirror.\"\n[48:00] Like, that's how unbothered he was by\n[48:03] that of I feel like so many people get\n[48:06] road rage as so many people talk out\n[48:08] loud to the cars while they're while\n[48:10] they're driving.\n[48:12] And he it just never got him worked up.\n[48:14] And realizing\n[48:16] my value and my worth of knowing who I\n[48:20] am is not at all determined\n[48:23] by\n[48:25] where you feel I should go. It goes back\n[48:27] to that idea of if you want to tell me\n[48:29] the sky is purple, knock yourself out.\n[48:32] You know, I I don't have to be right and\n[48:35] you don't have the ability to to push\n[48:37] me. I can move and you have your own. I\n[48:40] I know my lane. I know my speed. I don't\n[48:43] have to match anybody else's. So when\n[48:45] somebody is unbothered, it's not because\n[48:48] they don't care. It's not for lack of\n[48:50] care.\n[48:52] It's an understanding. It's discernment\n[48:55] of knowing\n[48:57] I know who I am in this moment and why\n[48:59] in the world would I try to be anybody\n[49:01] else?\n[49:02] >> Wouldn't life be amazing if we could all\n[49:04] be untriggerable?\n[49:06] It'd be more peaceable, that's for sure.\n[49:08] >> It's interesting because again, just\n[49:10] reflecting on that interview I watched\n[49:11] this morning, when Dame Dash calls\n[49:13] Charlemagne something really, really\n[49:15] offensive, I noticed that as a viewer, I\n[49:17] immediately look at Charlemagne\n[49:19] to see his reaction to figure out if\n[49:22] what Dame Dash just said was true.\n[49:25] And do you see what I'm saying? So he he\n[49:26] turned to him and said, \"You're ex,\n[49:28] >> right?\"\n[49:29] >> And then Charlemagne just kind of\n[49:31] laughed and like\n[49:32] >> it just it was like water off a duck's\n[49:34] back. So immediately as the viewer I go,\n[49:35] \"Well, that can't be true then because\n[49:36] Charlemagne doesn't seem to care.\"\n[49:38] >> Exactly. Well, it's it's not the lack of\n[49:41] a care. It's\n[49:44] it's just the opposite. It's all the\n[49:46] more care of knowing who he is. So, if I\n[49:52] were to tell you right now, I hate your\n[49:55] purple shirt. It's the most ugliest\n[49:58] purple shirt I've ever seen, Stephen.\n[50:00] Like your shirt is so ugly in that\n[50:02] purple. Does it affect you whatsoever?\n[50:06] >> No, because I'm not wearing a purple\n[50:07] shirt for anyone that's an apple.\n[50:09] >> That's right. [laughter]\n[50:10] That's a good point. Right. But you see\n[50:12] how you you already know the\n[50:14] characteristics of of you. You already\n[50:16] know what you're wearing.\n[50:18] >> And it's not just your clothes. I'm I'm\n[50:20] wearing my confidence. I'm wearing\n[50:23] everything that your parents, your your\n[50:26] loved ones have instilled and put on\n[50:27] you. I am I am wearing the armor of my\n[50:30] faith. I I am I have all these other\n[50:32] things that I'm wearing. And if you want\n[50:35] to say my shirt's purple, that that\n[50:38] doesn't affect me at all because that's\n[50:39] that's not who I am. And so so often\n[50:42] people get mixed up of arguing about no,\n[50:45] I don't have a purple shirt on.\n[50:48] >> When why would you ever argue with that?\n[50:51] They they it's that quote by Abraham\n[50:54] Lincoln that I love.\n[50:57] if never argue with a fool because an\n[50:59] onlooker\n[51:01] >> can never know the difference, right?\n[51:03] And so it's it's knowing no, I I know\n[51:06] exactly who I am and what I'm wearing.\n[51:09] >> And this sort of speaks to the fact that\n[51:10] your reaction determines how onlookers\n[51:13] will interpret everything that's\n[51:15] happening.\n[51:17] >> Like, you know,\n[51:18] >> oh, the worst thing you could do to\n[51:19] somebody who insults you is laugh. I\n[51:21] mean, what does it do? It I mean, it it\n[51:23] it infuriates them, right? But when the\n[51:26] same thing with a bully, a bully says\n[51:28] something to you that they know is meant\n[51:31] to hurt you.\n[51:33] And if I were to turn around and say,\n[51:35] \"Did you say that to to embarrass me?\" I\n[51:38] mean, what are they going to do? They\n[51:39] they could say yes, they could say no.\n[51:41] But either way, you're realizing I'm not\n[51:43] going to get any reaction. What you're\n[51:45] showing them is for you to do this, it's\n[51:47] just not going to be fun for you. It's\n[51:49] going to be zero fun whatsoever for you.\n[51:51] And so, they'll find that with somebody\n[51:53] somebody else. It's it's always your\n[51:55] reaction that's going to determine how\n[51:59] the conversation goes forward.\n[52:01] >> There's a lot of people listening right\n[52:02] now that are a long way away from that.\n[52:04] Very easily triggered.\n[52:05] >> Yeah.\n[52:06] >> Seeking justice, you know, whatever it\n[52:09] might be. For those people, is it like a\n[52:11] muscle they have to build or is there\n[52:13] what is the journey to getting to this\n[52:15] level of sort of mastery?\n[52:16] >> It's a discipline. It is in the same way\n[52:20] that people invest in so many other\n[52:22] things in our life. We invest in our\n[52:24] health. We invest in self-help books. We\n[52:27] invest in the podcasts that we listen\n[52:29] to. It is the same. You have to invest\n[52:31] in your communication. We don't get\n[52:33] taught in school. We don't, you know, I\n[52:36] I went to law school. People think I\n[52:38] learned this in law school. No. Law\n[52:40] school teaches you how to read the law.\n[52:41] It doesn't teach you how to read people.\n[52:43] You had to. To me, if you are somebody\n[52:47] that is in a position of expertise and\n[52:49] to share something, it either came at\n[52:51] great personal cost or you're making it\n[52:53] up like it it it is something that you\n[52:56] have learned, right? [laughter]\n[52:58] >> It's true. And so I mean whether it's\n[53:01] through skill, knowledge, training, it's\n[53:04] I've you want to know how that I know\n[53:06] these things because I've lived it. You\n[53:08] know, I I have been on the bad side.\n[53:09] I've been on the good side. And it's it\n[53:14] is not it's never something that's just\n[53:15] going to come to you.\n[53:17] >> We are emotional creatures and we're\n[53:19] hormonal creatures.\n[53:20] >> Mhm. So, how do how do you think about\n[53:22] our emotions, our hormones, our health,\n[53:24] our physical, cognitive state as it\n[53:26] relates to like walking into the\n[53:28] courtroom and being ready? Like how much\n[53:30] of it, you know, because if I've had\n[53:31] zero hours sleep and I'm, I don't know,\n[53:33] hungry and whatever else and I'm had an\n[53:36] argument, I'm stressed about something,\n[53:37] it's going to be significantly harder to\n[53:39] show up and be a great communicator and\n[53:40] win the argument against somebody,\n[53:42] >> right?\n[53:43] >> So, do you think about these things\n[53:45] >> all the time? I mean, the emotions are\n[53:47] are right there connected to the words.\n[53:49] And what do you how do you prepare to be\n[53:51] ready for battle?\n[53:54] >> It's an emotional awareness of how I'm\n[53:57] feeling\n[53:59] and also how the other person is because\n[54:01] if I just respond me Yeah. If I respond\n[54:04] to their emotional reaction, I'll miss\n[54:06] it every time. Same thing in\n[54:08] relationships. If I respond to the\n[54:11] reaction, I'll lose that moment to\n[54:13] actually speak to the need. So even in\n[54:16] the courtroom for me, if I know that I'm\n[54:20] a little sleepy, I know I'm a little\n[54:22] hungry, I'm a little grumpy, you know\n[54:24] what? I can either try and pretend that\n[54:26] I'm not. Or I might get up in front of\n[54:29] the jury and say, \"Good morning,\n[54:30] everybody. I have to admit to you, I'm a\n[54:32] little grumpy. I didn't need all that\n[54:33] much this morning. Anybody else grumpy?\"\n[54:35] And everybody starts to kind of nod. And\n[54:36] now, hey, we all kind of relate, not to\n[54:39] my words, but now to the feeling. And\n[54:41] now you trust me more. I trust you more\n[54:45] because I'm being more authentic.\n[54:47] >> And do you think people should do that\n[54:49] in their own interpersonal relationships\n[54:51] which is just call out their state?\n[54:53] >> Absolutely. Because perfection is not\n[54:55] relatable. Struggle is emotions are. If\n[54:59] I were to come to you and say and you\n[55:02] say how are you and I go good\n[55:03] everything's good when it is not. Am I\n[55:06] being authentic or am I being fake? But\n[55:08] if I were to say, \"Let me tell you, I've\n[55:11] had a morning and it's tested me in a\n[55:13] way I was not expecting and my mind is\n[55:16] just not here.\" Does that make you trust\n[55:18] me more or trust me less?\n[55:20] >> Trust me more\n[55:20] >> every time.\n[55:22] >> So, when you can share your struggles\n[55:23] with people, I'm not talking about your\n[55:24] deepest inner desire struggles. I'm\n[55:27] saying, let me put it this way. Sierra\n[55:31] and I check in with each other every\n[55:32] morning. It's my wife.\n[55:35] And it's only about 10 minutes after she\n[55:38] drops the kid off, uh, kids off. And\n[55:42] we kind of run through how we're doing.\n[55:44] And the number one thing she asks me or\n[55:46] tells me, he goes, \"You told me a lot\n[55:48] about what you're doing. You haven't\n[55:50] told me about how you're feeling.\" And\n[55:52] that's that's the truth of the default,\n[55:55] I think, of a lot of men and a lot of\n[55:56] people. I'm going to tell you what's\n[55:57] going on, what's on my agenda, what I'm\n[56:00] doing. I haven't told you a lot about\n[56:01] how I'm feeling. And we store all that\n[56:04] stuff up because it's still there. But\n[56:06] if I can share with you,\n[56:09] what is my struggle? What's happening?\n[56:12] Not just the good, but more importantly\n[56:13] the the bad.\n[56:16] I mean that it's always going to bring\n[56:18] that authenticity into the play.\n[56:20] >> Women and men are very different in many\n[56:22] ways. And [laughter]\n[56:24] >> yeah,\n[56:24] >> we're very different in many ways. Men\n[56:26] are I I don't know. It feels like men\n[56:28] just, you know, and again, I'm I'm\n[56:30] stereotyping here, so it's not all men\n[56:32] and\n[56:32] >> of course people are different, but just\n[56:34] speaking generally, the stereotype is\n[56:37] that men are a typically a bit more\n[56:39] emotionally composed or should I say\n[56:42] flat and women have uh more emotional\n[56:45] fluctuations. One could look at hormone\n[56:47] changes throughout the month and talk\n[56:49] about why that might be, etc., etc. I've\n[56:50] had many scientists here talk to me\n[56:52] about hormone fluctuations and how that\n[56:53] impacts how someone feels. But what this\n[56:56] means in our romantic relationships is\n[56:59] sometimes we meet each other on very\n[57:02] different wavelengths.\n[57:03] >> Yeah.\n[57:03] >> So in my relationship, my partner's\n[57:06] probably seen me cry once,\n[57:08] >> right?\n[57:09] >> In seven years, maybe twice, but\n[57:12] probably once.\n[57:14] I've probably seen her cry\n[57:17] 500 times, [laughter] maybe more.\n[57:19] >> Yeah.\n[57:19] >> So it feels it almost feels like I'm\n[57:22] just going to be completely honest\n[57:23] because I just think it's helpful. So\n[57:23] you can [ __ ] me up online if you want.\n[57:25] But I it sometimes feels like\n[57:29] we're we're a different species.\n[57:32] >> Like the way that I interact with my guy\n[57:33] friendss and the way that the sort of\n[57:36] wavelength that my romantic partner my\n[57:38] my my girlfriend operates on are very\n[57:41] very different. So it's very easy to\n[57:42] like misunderstand. And we spend a lot\n[57:44] of time talking about how men need to be\n[57:46] more emotional and more I don't know men\n[57:49] need to change how the how they are.\n[57:51] Yeah. Because it's the problem. But\n[57:54] what about the like what about the other\n[57:56] side of that which is\n[57:59] [laughter]\n[58:01] do\n[58:03] do women also need to think about\n[58:06] do we need to meet in the middle\n[58:07] [laughter]\n[58:08] is what I'm saying\n[58:10] >> there certainly is space to meet in the\n[58:12] middle\n[58:13] >> like who's right in that I don't know is\n[58:14] is is there a person that's right in\n[58:16] this configuration am I meant to be way\n[58:18] more emotional and be or or is she meant\n[58:21] to be way more composed cuz I I think\n[58:22] that's often how both sides feel. They\n[58:25] feel like, why aren't you coming to my\n[58:26] wavelength on this issue? But I think\n[58:28] here's what you're missing. She would be\n[58:29] much more composed if you would be more\n[58:31] emotional.\n[58:34] >> And so a lot of the times what I find in\n[58:37] my own marriage is when I show emotion,\n[58:41] the more composed she is.\n[58:43] >> I mean, if I start screaming and crying,\n[58:45] I I think my girlfriend's\n[58:46] >> I'm not saying screaming. I'm I'm saying\n[58:48] show emotion. What kind of emotion\n[58:51] >> of being in it with her?\n[58:52] >> And what does that look like?\n[58:54] >> That means you're going to say things\n[58:56] that make her feel it. There's a\n[59:00] difference if I just go static. That's\n[59:02] what happens to me a lot. Uh truthfully,\n[59:04] is let's say we're in an argument about\n[59:06] something or something came up and see\n[59:10] emotional about it. If I dismiss it,\n[59:14] okay, this is so dumb really right now.\n[59:16] This is because arguments never come at\n[59:17] the most opportune time. They come at\n[59:19] the worst possible time. Yeah, that's\n[59:21] hello. That's all relationships. If I\n[59:23] dismiss it, right, does that make her\n[59:25] come closer to me or further away from\n[59:27] me? And if I'm pushing her further away\n[59:29] from me, why would she not be more\n[59:31] emotional? Why why would she why would\n[59:33] she not be further away from me if I\n[59:36] dismiss that? For every woman to be more\n[59:40] emotional as a man, tears are not\n[59:42] necessary.\n[59:44] connection is being in it is saying\n[59:47] things that make her feel that you're\n[59:49] you're genuinely feeling it. The\n[59:51] difference I find with men and what I\n[59:53] struggle with is I can say that I'm sad.\n[59:56] I have a hard time expressing sad. I can\n[59:59] say that I'm really regretful. I have a\n[01:00:01] hard time\n[01:00:03] expressing that. I think that is\n[01:00:06] something that happens a lot with most\n[01:00:09] relationships and I think that happens a\n[01:00:10] lot with men of we were emotional and we\n[01:00:14] got taught early that\n[01:00:17] you you were not to cry. We I couldn't\n[01:00:19] even tell you how many times I ever saw\n[01:00:20] my dad cry.\n[01:00:22] >> I think this is it. The modeling we had\n[01:00:24] as well is my dad was either angry or\n[01:00:27] completely static. And when I say angry,\n[01:00:29] he was very very rarely angry. But but\n[01:00:31] when I saw him engage with my mom on an\n[01:00:34] emotional level, it would be\n[01:00:36] >> him yelling back,\n[01:00:38] >> right?\n[01:00:39] >> If he wasn't yelling back, he was\n[01:00:41] completely just like he was just very\n[01:00:43] calm, static, emotional. There was no in\n[01:00:46] between.\n[01:00:46] >> Yeah. It's it all comes down to repair.\n[01:00:50] How quickly you get to repair. That\n[01:00:54] means can I validate the feeling that\n[01:00:57] she has?\n[01:00:59] Validation\n[01:01:00] is repair. It's not weakness. It's\n[01:01:03] repair. In my world,\n[01:01:06] relationships don't fall apart because\n[01:01:08] of one big failure. They fall apart\n[01:01:10] because of a hundred moments where\n[01:01:14] repair could have happened and it\n[01:01:16] didn't. You just chose not to. Or you\n[01:01:19] could have said, \"I'm sorry,\" but you\n[01:01:20] withheld it. I could have chose to\n[01:01:22] validate how you're feeling, but I said\n[01:01:23] that's stupid. And it's it's those the\n[01:01:26] hundreds of those little bitty moments\n[01:01:28] where all of a sudden, no wonder your\n[01:01:31] your world's apart because you chose in\n[01:01:33] those little bitty moments not to do the\n[01:01:35] repair because you said, \"Ah, this is so\n[01:01:36] stupid. This so small.\" Yeah, it is\n[01:01:38] small. All the more reason why you\n[01:01:40] should repair pretty quickly. And so\n[01:01:42] when you can validate those concerns,\n[01:01:46] even when you say she's being emotional,\n[01:01:48] you're not.\n[01:01:50] When you go into that static mode, when\n[01:01:51] I go into that static mode, it's a\n[01:01:53] choice by me to do something different,\n[01:01:57] not say the thing I always say, not be\n[01:01:59] dismissive, not find ways to try and\n[01:02:02] convince her that she shouldn't feel\n[01:02:04] this way, but if I validate, if I say\n[01:02:08] things like, I can see how you feel that\n[01:02:10] way. If that's how you interpreted it,\n[01:02:14] you know what? I don't blame you for\n[01:02:15] feeling that way. I I can see that. That\n[01:02:17] sounds scary. That sounds frustrating.\n[01:02:19] If I can choose that it's it's this like\n[01:02:24] this isn't the key for me and trust me\n[01:02:26] I'm talking to myself here.\n[01:02:28] >> Yeah.\n[01:02:28] >> Right. Because every every guy I feel\n[01:02:30] like can be like, \"Okay, this is right.\"\n[01:02:32] And if I can\n[01:02:35] make the hard choice in that moment to\n[01:02:36] put aside my frustration just for a\n[01:02:38] moment, put aside my personal\n[01:02:40] frustration\n[01:02:42] and validate the feeling and say words\n[01:02:46] that speak to her need, the need to feel\n[01:02:50] heard, the need to feel safe, the need\n[01:02:52] to feel like she's not being too much.\n[01:02:55] Then all of a sudden, it all shrinks.\n[01:02:58] And you know what? my frustration kind\n[01:03:00] of goes away. Why? Because everything's\n[01:03:02] better now. We've we've had moments of\n[01:03:04] repair. And then if I still am really\n[01:03:06] frustrated, then I can bring it up. Hey,\n[01:03:09] can I can I bring up something to you\n[01:03:10] that you said that's really bothering\n[01:03:12] me? And then you do it.\n[01:03:14] >> How as a man do you know that you're not\n[01:03:18] setting a bad precedence for the future?\n[01:03:21] And what I mean here is\n[01:03:22] >> Yeah. if I constantly, you know, justify\n[01:03:25] how she's feeling and I and I seek\n[01:03:27] repair and then when she's happy, I just\n[01:03:28] let it go. There's I think sometimes\n[01:03:31] there's a worry as a man that if you\n[01:03:36] just lay down and take everything, then\n[01:03:37] you're just going to get more stuff in\n[01:03:38] the future. Like you're setting a bad\n[01:03:40] precedence for the future of this\n[01:03:41] relationship where no, sometimes\n[01:03:42] actually no, I wasn't in the wrong or oh\n[01:03:44] no, I did I I do disagree with this.\n[01:03:46] >> Right? And I think I've observed a lot\n[01:03:49] of relationships, especially with some\n[01:03:50] of my guy friends where because they\n[01:03:52] like never stood up for themselves,\n[01:03:54] they're now like living in a prison,\n[01:03:56] >> right?\n[01:03:56] >> They like never stood up for themselves.\n[01:03:59] >> Yes.\n[01:03:59] >> And so they're they've kind of lost all\n[01:04:01] of their autonomy and agency and control\n[01:04:03] and they,\n[01:04:04] >> you know, even when you're listening to\n[01:04:05] this, there's probably people you can\n[01:04:06] think of in your life where the guy has\n[01:04:08] always opted for an easy life in the\n[01:04:10] short term and now over the long term,\n[01:04:12] he has a really hard one.\n[01:04:13] >> Yes.\n[01:04:14] >> And again, men and women,\n[01:04:15] >> of course. So this is the balance I'm\n[01:04:18] trying to understand in your view is you\n[01:04:20] know when do you pick the fight and when\n[01:04:21] do you say no that's not\n[01:04:24] versus just laying down and taking it.\n[01:04:26] This is quite [laughter] per this is\n[01:04:27] quite personal to me as well because I\n[01:04:29] think my dad did that a bit too much. I\n[01:04:30] think my dad, he never he never chose to\n[01:04:33] fight. And then I look I look at how\n[01:04:35] that played out over 20 years and I'm\n[01:04:36] like, damn, it's completely changed me\n[01:04:39] because it means that I will now go\n[01:04:42] through the conflict\n[01:04:45] >> and stand up for myself when I hit a\n[01:04:47] place where I'm like that I'm not going\n[01:04:49] to be able to honor that for you for the\n[01:04:51] next 30 years. I will stand my ground.\n[01:04:54] Do you know if there's like an area\n[01:04:55] where um we might my say my girlfriend's\n[01:04:57] unhappy about a certain thing I do.\n[01:04:59] >> Yeah. If I don't think that I'm I'm\n[01:05:01] going to be able to promise to not do\n[01:05:02] that for the next like 10, 20, 30 years,\n[01:05:04] if I if I'm unwilling to change, Yes. I\n[01:05:07] have to stand my ground because if I\n[01:05:09] concede today, it's hell tomorrow.\n[01:05:11] >> Yeah. What what I'm hearing what I'm\n[01:05:14] hearing is fear of autonomy, fear of my\n[01:05:20] rights, fear of my\n[01:05:23] >> dominance.\n[01:05:24] >> Yeah. Like my freedom being Yeah. Well,\n[01:05:26] it's it's you want to hear the probably\n[01:05:28] the number one word you'll hear with\n[01:05:31] relationships that are on the brink.\n[01:05:33] It's caged. Men feels caged. You know,\n[01:05:36] the man feels caged. And really all that\n[01:05:39] is, it's a lack of confidence\n[01:05:42] of knowing\n[01:05:45] if I am willing to do something\n[01:05:49] different,\n[01:05:52] then I can't have anything else. So it's\n[01:05:54] it's it's thinking in terms of\n[01:05:59] zero sum. See, both can be true. I can\n[01:06:03] you can still validate how she's feeling\n[01:06:07] and not at all touch what you still know\n[01:06:09] to be true. So you can still disagree\n[01:06:11] with her, but every time we go into a\n[01:06:14] conversation, we walk in with a need, a\n[01:06:17] need to feel loved, understood, it is\n[01:06:19] always depth. Like you think of um like\n[01:06:23] a kid, right? My son, my daughter, if\n[01:06:27] when she was small and she screamed or\n[01:06:31] she cried or told me no, still tells me\n[01:06:33] no, you know, of all these things and I\n[01:06:35] just said no. Are you kidding me? You're\n[01:06:37] going to tell me and I you're crying\n[01:06:38] right now? Really? And I get all upset\n[01:06:40] when she screams. But with kids, we\n[01:06:43] don't do that. We go she's hungry. She's\n[01:06:45] tired. She's scared. M\n[01:06:48] >> and we just forget that we're all just\n[01:06:50] big kids and we all have those like\n[01:06:52] hidden needs underneath us and so you\n[01:06:56] still can stand your ground and say\n[01:07:00] so let's run it. So let's say for\n[01:07:02] example\n[01:07:03] >> an example a specific example from my\n[01:07:04] ex-girlfriend I was on my phone in bed\n[01:07:06] and I was sending a message cuz there's\n[01:07:07] something going on my in my business\n[01:07:08] back in the UK and I was in I was in\n[01:07:10] Asia at the time.\n[01:07:11] >> Yeah. And she said to me that she wanted\n[01:07:14] to make a rule where there was never any\n[01:07:16] phones in bed ever. I could never touch\n[01:07:19] my phone in the bedroom.\n[01:07:20] >> Right?\n[01:07:20] >> And as I thought this through, I\n[01:07:21] thought, God, I thought about all the\n[01:07:23] scenarios where I might need to touch my\n[01:07:24] phone in the bedroom. And what would I I\n[01:07:28] realized that what would end up\n[01:07:29] happening is I just wouldn't come into\n[01:07:30] the bedroom. I'd like go and do it in\n[01:07:32] the in [clears throat] the toilet or the\n[01:07:33] shower or I just like I wouldn't come to\n[01:07:34] bed if I needed to do something on my\n[01:07:36] phone,\n[01:07:36] >> right? And so the conversation went\n[01:07:39] where I was like I I realized in this\n[01:07:41] moment I had to kind of like not lay\n[01:07:44] down on this issue because I would\n[01:07:45] disappoint her in the future.\n[01:07:47] >> I was setting myself up to fail in the\n[01:07:49] future if I if I accepted this and made\n[01:07:51] her some kind of promise or you know\n[01:07:53] agreed that we I wasn't going to touch\n[01:07:54] my phone ever again in the bedroom.\n[01:07:57] >> And so that was one such example where\n[01:07:58] I'm like I think [clears throat] I\n[01:07:59] actually need to stand my ground a bit\n[01:08:01] here or I'm setting myself up for a\n[01:08:02] future expectation I can't meet.\n[01:08:05] So in that moment, what did you think\n[01:08:07] her need was?\n[01:08:08] >> Her need was connection. And she was\n[01:08:10] interpreting me being on the phone in\n[01:08:12] that space as a disconnection in some\n[01:08:14] way.\n[01:08:15] >> And could it possibly be perceived as\n[01:08:18] that?\n[01:08:18] >> 100%.\n[01:08:19] >> Okay.\n[01:08:19] >> But it wasn't the phone. It was the it\n[01:08:21] was the it was me not it was her not\n[01:08:25] feeling connected I in my view it at\n[01:08:27] that moment in time in that particular\n[01:08:29] week because I was so busy in that\n[01:08:31] particular week that I think she was\n[01:08:33] trying to find a a symptom or a tool or\n[01:08:37] a guarantee or a promise to express the\n[01:08:40] feeling of disconnection. So that's why\n[01:08:41] I look back on it and go it was actually\n[01:08:42] something else that was just a symptom\n[01:08:43] of a feeling she had at that moment in\n[01:08:45] time probably.\n[01:08:45] >> Right. But that was an example where\n[01:08:47] like I if id conceded it would have it\n[01:08:51] would not have been sustainable. There\n[01:08:52] would have been arguments in the future.\n[01:08:53] >> I'm not saying you concede. I'm saying\n[01:08:56] there are times that if you want the key\n[01:08:59] to the relationship, it is putting her\n[01:09:02] comfort over your inconvenience.\n[01:09:04] >> So what should I have done in that\n[01:09:05] situation? Give me some advice. Do you\n[01:09:07] think?\n[01:09:09] >> Well, you've already kind of named it.\n[01:09:11] one, she's it's not you saying what the\n[01:09:14] wrong thing to say is, \"Well, you were\n[01:09:16] just on your phone. I mean, you just I\n[01:09:18] mean, you're on your phone all your\n[01:09:19] time. You're on the phone all the time.\n[01:09:20] What are you talking about?\" And you\n[01:09:21] start arguing because now you're you're\n[01:09:24] responding to the reaction. You're not\n[01:09:26] addressing the need. If you were to slow\n[01:09:28] down\n[01:09:29] and say, \"Look, I I still want to be\n[01:09:33] connected with you. Is there any kind of\n[01:09:36] place where I can still take care of\n[01:09:38] what I need to take care of?\" and also\n[01:09:41] be connected to you. Or if there's a\n[01:09:43] situation where you say, \"Well, what\n[01:09:45] about this?\"\n[01:09:47] Before I just get my phone and grab it,\n[01:09:49] I'm going to tell you what I'm doing\n[01:09:50] ahead of time or I'm going to ask.\n[01:09:54] Maybe that's where it is. You don't want\n[01:09:55] to ask, \"Hey, I\n[01:09:58] Greg is supposed to email me some\n[01:10:01] slides or a deck or whatever. Can I\n[01:10:04] check that out real quick?\" You hear how\n[01:10:05] she's probably going to say yes. But the\n[01:10:07] fact that you are saying, \"Hey, I'm\n[01:10:09] acknowledging our connection right now.\"\n[01:10:12] And see, it might make you uncomfortable\n[01:10:13] saying, \"No, I don't I don't like\n[01:10:14] anybody telling me what to do. I don't\n[01:10:16] have to I don't want to report to\n[01:10:17] anybody.\" Okay, that's that's fine.\n[01:10:19] Well, then you just know that connection\n[01:10:22] is always going to be weak. And so, you\n[01:10:23] you're signing your name to that. I\n[01:10:26] don't think I mean there's I have lots\n[01:10:28] of thoughts on phones in houses and\n[01:10:31] where they should go, but if you were to\n[01:10:34] have instead of arguing the what are you\n[01:10:37] talking about? You're on your phone all\n[01:10:38] all the time. And instead said,\n[01:10:42] I can see how that would make you feel\n[01:10:45] like I'm not paying attention to you.\n[01:10:47] And letting her respond to that and you\n[01:10:49] saying, look, I don't want to me being\n[01:10:51] on this. This is not at all me trying to\n[01:10:53] signal that I'm not trying to be here\n[01:10:56] with you. I'm trying to escape on you\n[01:10:58] and have that conversation. And that's\n[01:11:00] where you can say it is important to me\n[01:11:02] that I have these things and for me to\n[01:11:04] be able to connect with you and kind of\n[01:11:05] rest my brain. I need to take care of\n[01:11:07] these things. What's the best way that I\n[01:11:10] can do that? I think then that's when\n[01:11:12] you actually are able to have a\n[01:11:13] conversation of like let's make a g game\n[01:11:15] plan that makes sense because\n[01:11:18] if you you put your inconvenience over\n[01:11:21] her comfort she will always discredit\n[01:11:25] that to you your bank account will\n[01:11:26] always continue to to go low\n[01:11:30] and if but if you say look I I'm willing\n[01:11:32] to do a little bit of inconvenient\n[01:11:34] things to make you feel better make you\n[01:11:37] more comfortable I mean that that only\n[01:11:39] grows your account I mean that that when\n[01:11:42] when you have a relationship that can\n[01:11:45] last a whole lot longer.\n[01:11:47] >> I think I'm slightly traumatized because\n[01:11:49] um [laughter]\n[01:11:50] I I think the model that I had of\n[01:11:53] relationships meant that someone can\n[01:11:56] increasingly sort of encroach on your\n[01:11:57] freedom.\n[01:11:58] >> Yes.\n[01:11:59] >> Until you are virtually powerless.\n[01:12:01] >> I think that's a lot of guys. And\n[01:12:03] >> I've felt that. I've certainly felt\n[01:12:04] that.\n[01:12:05] >> Yeah. So I I try and fight back and\n[01:12:07] sometimes I think I overdo it. And this\n[01:12:09] is what this is one such example where\n[01:12:11] actually objectively when I hear myself\n[01:12:12] say she asked me not to like be in on my\n[01:12:16] phone in bed. I'm like well it's kind of\n[01:12:17] a reasonable request to be honest. Like\n[01:12:19] the bedroom can be a place where we just\n[01:12:20] like go on the phones. I could just do\n[01:12:21] it in my office and then come to bed\n[01:12:22] when I'm ready.\n[01:12:23] >> Right.\n[01:12:24] >> But I think my I get my backup because\n[01:12:26] I've just got so many examples of men\n[01:12:28] who like didn't stand up for themselves.\n[01:12:30] >> Yes.\n[01:12:30] >> And then were rendered powerless down\n[01:12:31] the line. So it's like if I give you\n[01:12:33] this then tomorrow you're going to say\n[01:12:34] maybe you can't be on my phone in the\n[01:12:36] kitchen\n[01:12:36] >> and then maybe I can't be on my phone in\n[01:12:38] the bathroom. And then so I just\n[01:12:39] thought, well, if I just stand up for\n[01:12:40] myself here, then I just hold hold off.\n[01:12:43] >> What I'm not at all saying is that the\n[01:12:45] guy go, \"Yeah, sure. That's fine.\" And\n[01:12:47] then she asks for something. I go,\n[01:12:48] \"Yeah, sure. That's fine.\" And you just\n[01:12:49] you're super passive with everything.\n[01:12:51] That's where I think you do feel like\n[01:12:52] you're just you look around, you you've\n[01:12:54] given up everything to where you don't\n[01:12:56] feel like I I have anything to to grab\n[01:12:58] on to.\n[01:12:59] >> I want to throw in another example that\n[01:13:00] a lot of people relate to. A lot of men\n[01:13:01] have like a hobby with with their guy\n[01:13:03] friends, right?\n[01:13:04] >> Like watching the football, talking [ __ ]\n[01:13:06] in a group chat. I think it's so\n[01:13:09] important to defend those things.\n[01:13:10] >> Absolutely.\n[01:13:11] >> Even for her attraction to you.\n[01:13:13] >> Like I think I I have no evidence to say\n[01:13:15] that this is true. It's just a feeling.\n[01:13:17] I think to some degree that my partner\n[01:13:18] likes the fact that I'll stand up for\n[01:13:20] myself in certain in certain areas and\n[01:13:22] that I'll say, \"No, no, no, no. This is\n[01:13:23] me time. This is for me.\"\n[01:13:24] >> I agree.\n[01:13:25] >> And I can imagine the opposite, the\n[01:13:26] pacivity or kind of rolling over as\n[01:13:29] being a really like unattractive thing.\n[01:13:31] >> Absolutely. I I think where you are\n[01:13:34] laying yourself down or just rolling\n[01:13:36] over that is that can be very\n[01:13:38] unattractive that it's you need to have\n[01:13:40] a backbone. At the same time, you can't\n[01:13:42] be so extreme that your way is the only\n[01:13:44] way. But when you choose to say, \"No,\n[01:13:45] no, this is I'm going to willing to take\n[01:13:47] a stand here.\" Then that's I think to me\n[01:13:50] it sends a signal of strength, right?\n[01:13:52] Strength of mind, strength of will. But\n[01:13:54] for me, when you have those things that\n[01:13:56] are your hobbies, the things that you\n[01:13:58] really like, a sign of a good\n[01:14:00] relationship is that she's going to be\n[01:14:02] happy, you get to do those because they\n[01:14:04] make you happy. Even though she might\n[01:14:06] hate it and think it's annoying and it's\n[01:14:08] weird and you know, you're taking up\n[01:14:09] that space in the garage and whatever,\n[01:14:12] but if it makes you happy and they know\n[01:14:15] that this is your space and this is your\n[01:14:17] time because I I you have to have those\n[01:14:20] things that fill you up, right? And the\n[01:14:24] truth is the marriage isn't enough. The\n[01:14:26] kids aren't enough. Your job's aren't\n[01:14:27] enough. You have to have things that\n[01:14:30] personally for you by yourself. If your\n[01:14:32] thing is to go to a pond and go feed\n[01:14:35] ducks, go do it. You know, to to be able\n[01:14:37] to fill yourself up. If you if\n[01:14:41] like I I I know for parents, early\n[01:14:43] parents, there's this this mindset of I\n[01:14:46] have to be with my kid all the time. I I\n[01:14:48] can't ever leave my kid. That I need to\n[01:14:49] just be there.\n[01:14:51] But what you find is you'll be so much\n[01:14:54] better when you actually go take care of\n[01:14:56] yourself and go on that guy trip, uh, go\n[01:14:59] play that round of golf or whatever it\n[01:15:01] is that's actually going to feed you and\n[01:15:03] fill you up and then I can be there for\n[01:15:06] you all the more.\n[01:15:07] >> I think some people's partners,\n[01:15:09] they don't they're not like that. Some\n[01:15:11] people are in a relationship where their\n[01:15:12] partner cuts out as much of these things\n[01:15:16] as they possibly can. Yeah.\n[01:15:17] >> So that they can control their partner.\n[01:15:19] I mean, we I think we've all got a\n[01:15:20] friend in a group chat.\n[01:15:22] >> Oh, yeah.\n[01:15:22] >> Who [laughter]\n[01:15:24] >> has kind of like seems to have lost all\n[01:15:25] their freedom and their autonomy and\n[01:15:27] agency since they've been in that\n[01:15:28] relationship.\n[01:15:28] >> They'd say they're on a leash.\n[01:15:29] >> Yeah. They're on a leash. Like they can\n[01:15:30] never come to the thing.\n[01:15:31] >> Mhm.\n[01:15:33] >> That's not okay.\n[01:15:34] >> And it appears to be a consequence of\n[01:15:37] boundaries, like not\n[01:15:40] reinforcing your boundaries early. It\n[01:15:44] appears to me to be a bit of a slippery\n[01:15:46] slope boundaries.\n[01:15:47] >> Oh, yeah. Do you know what I mean? Like\n[01:15:49] where you like you kind of make a\n[01:15:50] concession and because you've made a\n[01:15:52] concession, they're more likely to\n[01:15:53] pursue another concession,\n[01:15:55] >> right?\n[01:15:55] >> And then before you know it, you're\n[01:15:57] behind bars [laughter] alone.\n[01:16:00] >> Yeah. And and frustrated and wondering\n[01:16:02] how you how you got here. I know we've\n[01:16:04] spoke about boundaries in the past. To\n[01:16:07] me, it it ultimately comes comes down to\n[01:16:11] am I protecting the priority? So, if I\n[01:16:15] know that my marriage is the priority,\n[01:16:17] I'm going to set boundaries that protect\n[01:16:18] that. I mean, for me in my life right\n[01:16:21] now, whether I'm working on a book or\n[01:16:24] speaking or a podcast or whatever, it's\n[01:16:27] am I setting the boundary up to be\n[01:16:28] protecting my my family in my\n[01:16:31] relationship.\n[01:16:33] So, you have to first define what is the\n[01:16:36] priority here. So if the priority is\n[01:16:38] knowing that\n[01:16:41] we want to be you and your partner want\n[01:16:44] to be in a relationship and you know\n[01:16:46] make sure that Thursday is date night.\n[01:16:48] Okay, that's nothing gets scheduled on\n[01:16:50] date night. There's certain things that\n[01:16:52] just aren't movable. The answer is no.\n[01:16:54] And when you can have those really hard\n[01:16:55] nos, it makes feeling the time of\n[01:16:59] everything else all that much easier.\n[01:17:02] But that's it. I mean it ultimately\n[01:17:04] comes down to are you being real about\n[01:17:06] it? Are you being fake about it?\n[01:17:08] >> In your view, you talk about being nice\n[01:17:10] and being kind. Um, I've heard you talk\n[01:17:12] about this on your podcast. What's the\n[01:17:14] difference between being a nice person\n[01:17:16] and a kind person? And which one should\n[01:17:17] I aspire to be? Stop being nice at the\n[01:17:21] expense of being real. So nice is\n[01:17:25] something that we got taught really\n[01:17:26] early on. Hey, be nice. Play nice.\n[01:17:30] And if you believe forever and always\n[01:17:33] that being nice serves you well, you\n[01:17:36] will ultimately serve it. You will\n[01:17:38] people please. You will only choose to\n[01:17:40] say the nice thing. You will nice is\n[01:17:44] very surface.\n[01:17:46] If you went on a date with somebody and\n[01:17:48] I was like, \"How was a date?\" And you\n[01:17:50] said, \"She was nice.\"\n[01:17:51] >> Yuck. Yuck.\n[01:17:53] >> Yeah. Does does that mean that was good?\n[01:17:55] No. Of course. But you're want to say\n[01:17:56] the nice thing. And so it becomes very\n[01:18:00] much about pleasantries of what's\n[01:18:03] something that that is politically\n[01:18:05] correct or whatever it is. Kind is very\n[01:18:09] deep. It's related to the word kin. It's\n[01:18:11] it's connection. So where nice is\n[01:18:14] concerned about surface, kind is worried\n[01:18:16] about connection. So\n[01:18:20] nice people say, \"Oh, I can't tell them\n[01:18:21] the truth. That's that wouldn't be nice.\n[01:18:23] That wouldn't be nice. I can't say\n[01:18:25] that.\" kind says, \"I care about you\n[01:18:28] enough to say the truth.\" That I I care\n[01:18:32] about you enough to tell you the truth.\n[01:18:34] So when you have the chance, don't\n[01:18:36] choose nice at the expense of being\n[01:18:39] real. Choose the kind thing. Like if you\n[01:18:42] and I were in a conversation and I was\n[01:18:46] like, I could really I could just go,\n[01:18:48] \"Yeah, man. That sounds great with the\n[01:18:50] decision you're going to make because I\n[01:18:51] just I don't want to upset you. That\n[01:18:53] that wouldn't be nice.\" versus me\n[01:18:55] saying, \"Stephen, I I have to tell you,\n[01:18:58] man,\n[01:18:59] this doesn't feel right to me.\" Which\n[01:19:01] one's the kind thing of of telling you\n[01:19:05] the actual truth? It's being authentic\n[01:19:06] to it. So, a lot of people, they they\n[01:19:08] look back and they're just people\n[01:19:09] pleasing. That's all they've they've\n[01:19:10] been because they've always chosen\n[01:19:12] what's nice, not what's kind.\n[01:19:14] >> You must get a lot of messages from a\n[01:19:16] lot of people pleasers\n[01:19:17] >> all the time.\n[01:19:18] >> And what is it they want from you?\n[01:19:20] They're wanting to know how to stop\n[01:19:22] pleasing other people and to start start\n[01:19:24] pleasing themselves. Like how to I\n[01:19:27] always say that there's not a problem\n[01:19:29] with people pleasing as long as you're\n[01:19:30] one of them. Yeah. Of of\n[01:19:33] it's okay to do things that other people\n[01:19:36] ask you to do and you want to serve\n[01:19:37] other people. I'm not saying it in a as\n[01:19:39] a servitude way of I can never have any\n[01:19:42] of my own voice. It's it's where you\n[01:19:47] constantly\n[01:19:48] are put yourself in inconvenient\n[01:19:53] places for the sake of other people\n[01:19:55] hoping that they will see your true\n[01:19:57] value. So they conflate\n[01:20:01] the pleasure of others with the value of\n[01:20:03] themselves.\n[01:20:04] And so meaning I mean nothing to myself\n[01:20:07] if you're not happy with me. I mean\n[01:20:10] nothing to myself if if I can't please\n[01:20:12] you. you you want this? Oh, okay. I'll\n[01:20:13] go get it. Oh, you need this. Let me do\n[01:20:15] this. Oh, I already thought about this.\n[01:20:16] You love this. And they've forgotten\n[01:20:20] their own sense. And so, I've met people\n[01:20:22] that have, you know, a lot of it's also\n[01:20:25] early childhood, right? They they\n[01:20:27] learned that to save the marriage\n[01:20:30] between mom and dad, they need to be\n[01:20:33] everything to everybody. They have to\n[01:20:34] give up. They they've missed childhood\n[01:20:36] in order to please everybody else. And\n[01:20:40] so it becomes a pattern of safety. It's\n[01:20:43] a survival skill of knowing for me to\n[01:20:45] have to survive in this, for me to have\n[01:20:48] worth, well, I can't do it unless\n[01:20:50] everybody else is happy with me.\n[01:20:52] >> Are there any case studies that come to\n[01:20:53] mind of people that have read your work\n[01:20:55] and have made real transformations that\n[01:20:57] have shocked you or made you happy or\n[01:21:01] proven to you the profoundity of being\n[01:21:03] able to take control of conversation?\n[01:21:06] We took a a survey poll within my\n[01:21:08] membership and it was already I think it\n[01:21:12] was like 93% of people with even in the\n[01:21:14] first\n[01:21:16] three chapters of my book it had already\n[01:21:20] significantly impacted them in their job\n[01:21:23] their family and exactly what they were\n[01:21:25] reading the book for because everybody\n[01:21:26] picks it up for the conversation they\n[01:21:28] have in their mind. you know, they\n[01:21:30] people don't watch my content to handle\n[01:21:32] to know how to handle the last\n[01:21:33] conversation. They watch to know how to\n[01:21:36] handle the the next one. And so to be\n[01:21:39] able to provide the results that they're\n[01:21:41] wanting\n[01:21:43] is a is a is a blessing.\n[01:21:46] I've just finished writing my third\n[01:21:47] book. I haven't firmed up the title yet,\n[01:21:49] but I have started mocking up some\n[01:21:51] different designs. And I've been doing\n[01:21:53] this with Adobe Express, which is one of\n[01:21:55] our sponsors. What I love about Adobe\n[01:21:56] Express is that it makes it so easy for\n[01:21:58] me to obsess over the tiniest details.\n[01:22:00] The typography, the font, the color, the\n[01:22:02] text placement, the stuff that might\n[01:22:04] sound petty to most people, but actually\n[01:22:06] compounds to create something that\n[01:22:08] stands out, something that's one better\n[01:22:11] than the rest. And designing my cover\n[01:22:12] art has reminded me of how many creative\n[01:22:14] things I've learned over the year. But\n[01:22:16] it's also reminded me that there are so\n[01:22:17] many creative minds around me that are\n[01:22:19] also sitting on their own secrets. So,\n[01:22:22] I've created the one better guide in\n[01:22:24] Adobe Express to bring those tips to\n[01:22:26] you. And in it, you'll find principles\n[01:22:28] from the very, very best in their\n[01:22:29] industry turned into quick and easy\n[01:22:31] practices for you to apply so you can\n[01:22:33] train yourself to create exactly like\n[01:22:35] the best performing teams in the world\n[01:22:36] do. Just head over to adobe./1\n[01:22:40] better to download Adobe Express now and\n[01:22:42] make sure you visit the learn tab to\n[01:22:44] discover how you can become one better\n[01:22:47] than the rest. Is there a particular\n[01:22:49] moment of conflict which you stays with\n[01:22:51] you the most when you think about a\n[01:22:54] difficult conversation in your life?\n[01:22:57] >> Yeah, there was one that I I talk about\n[01:23:01] in my book that was probably the most\n[01:23:03] gut-wrenching at that time was me\n[01:23:05] leaving the the law firm where I was at\n[01:23:07] and having to talk to my dad about\n[01:23:08] leaving that firm. But that's let's say\n[01:23:11] that's in the the book. What's fresh for\n[01:23:14] me now, you want to talk about that? I\n[01:23:16] mean, what's fresh for me now is\n[01:23:17] conversations that I've had with my\n[01:23:20] wife, with Sierra, and I'm having a hard\n[01:23:24] time\n[01:23:27] reaching and she's having a hard time\n[01:23:29] reaching for me, where I kind of just go\n[01:23:32] static\n[01:23:34] where I do feel sad, I do feel remorse,\n[01:23:37] or I I'm trying to and I have a hard\n[01:23:39] time expressing it. So the best thing I\n[01:23:41] can do in that mind is I use my words to\n[01:23:44] be able to say,\n[01:23:46] you know, I I feel regret for what's\n[01:23:49] happened or what I've done and I may not\n[01:23:52] be shown it right now, but I this is not\n[01:23:54] something I'm proud of. To be at least\n[01:23:56] able to show in my words how I'm\n[01:23:58] feeling. So it let's say for example\n[01:24:01] it's\n[01:24:03] about anything related to it could be\n[01:24:06] any argument really with a a husband and\n[01:24:09] a wife or a spouse or partner or\n[01:24:10] whatever it is. But we had one not too\n[01:24:14] long ago where we knew we were going to\n[01:24:17] be traveling for a bit and sometimes if\n[01:24:21] it's just the two of us what's going to\n[01:24:22] happen? You're going to you're going to\n[01:24:24] have some spats. about probably the\n[01:24:26] dumbest things you could probably have a\n[01:24:28] fight about, but that's what what\n[01:24:29] happens. And I said to her, I was like,\n[01:24:33] \"Well, that, you know, if we do this and\n[01:24:36] do that, you we'll probably we're not\n[01:24:38] probably going to argue about it. It's\n[01:24:39] going to be fine.\" And she said to me,\n[01:24:42] she said, \"Well,\n[01:24:44] either way, it's good.\"\n[01:24:46] Meaning, if you don't argue about\n[01:24:48] something, great. But if we do argue\n[01:24:50] about it, that's good, too. to be able\n[01:24:52] to see it as a chance to understand each\n[01:24:55] other a little bit more, to know each\n[01:24:56] other a little bit more. And\n[01:25:00] it's it's it's not without being\n[01:25:03] radically honest um with the person you\n[01:25:06] want to be with.\n[01:25:08] And that's that's hard for a lot of\n[01:25:10] people. I had a friend of mine say to me\n[01:25:12] the other day that the thing that annoys\n[01:25:13] him most about his wife is just like how\n[01:25:15] long she takes to get ready. And he like\n[01:25:16] really like offloaded it to me in a way\n[01:25:18] where I'm like this is a problem for\n[01:25:20] him. Yeah, she just takes so long to get\n[01:25:22] ready and she's like, which means\n[01:25:24] they're always late to things. A lot of\n[01:25:25] guys can relate to this, including\n[01:25:26] myself. But the way he said it to me was\n[01:25:28] was surprising. And I I remember\n[01:25:30] thinking, should he just go and have\n[01:25:32] this conversation with her or is this\n[01:25:35] like an illegitimate concern to raise?\n[01:25:37] And I think there sometimes with, you\n[01:25:39] know, because you were talking about\n[01:25:40] your experience with Sierra and her\n[01:25:42] saying like either way, it's a good\n[01:25:43] thing. Are all arguments\n[01:25:46] warranted? Like is that argument you\n[01:25:48] take too long to get ready and it's\n[01:25:49] pissing me off?\n[01:25:51] Is that a a valid thing to raise with\n[01:25:55] your partner?\n[01:25:57] >> In therapy, they say if it's hysterical,\n[01:25:59] it's historical.\n[01:26:01] Meaning, if it's really that big of a\n[01:26:03] deal, then there's probably something\n[01:26:04] deeper going on. If it's really\n[01:26:05] affecting you that much, it's like those\n[01:26:08] people who say, \"Well, he's always\n[01:26:09] pushing my buttons.\" I ask, \"Why is\n[01:26:10] there a button?\" You know, it's if if\n[01:26:13] it's always getting you worked up,\n[01:26:15] there's probably something deeper that\n[01:26:16] you're not noticing. It's probably\n[01:26:19] related to something that happened when\n[01:26:21] he was a kid or something that maybe\n[01:26:24] it's\n[01:26:26] here. Let me give a good example. You\n[01:26:29] know, in in our marriage, I'm the\n[01:26:32] spender. She's the saber.\n[01:26:35] >> Okay?\n[01:26:35] >> She she can turn a penny into a dime,\n[01:26:38] right? You can pinch a penny to a dime.\n[01:26:42] And she got really frustrated with me of\n[01:26:44] like, why do you always need the nicest\n[01:26:45] thing, right? And that's typically if\n[01:26:48] she's has an option of several things,\n[01:26:51] even if I don't know the price tags, I\n[01:26:53] typically end up going with the one\n[01:26:54] that's most expensive. And it infuriates\n[01:26:56] her, right? Because she she wouldn't do\n[01:26:58] that. She's going to wait for it to go\n[01:26:59] on sale. It she could have something she\n[01:27:01] really wants and she's just going to\n[01:27:03] track it forever in her mind until it\n[01:27:04] goes on sale. And that's that gives her\n[01:27:06] satisfaction. Me, I'll just go buy it.\n[01:27:09] And I'm not saying I'm crazy what's I'm\n[01:27:12] not like some crazy spender, but this is\n[01:27:14] an issue that has always bothered her.\n[01:27:16] and bothered me.\n[01:27:19] And what we had come to find out, we had\n[01:27:22] actually used this with my AI actually,\n[01:27:24] but what we had come to learn is that\n[01:27:30] the reason why it affected me so much of\n[01:27:33] like why why do you always choose the\n[01:27:34] the nice thing is related to when I was\n[01:27:36] a kid as the oldest,\n[01:27:40] I I didn't get much of the the nice\n[01:27:43] thing. my my stuff was typically hand me\n[01:27:46] down from a friend or something else or\n[01:27:48] I I didn't get the nice thing. And at\n[01:27:51] some point along the way, you equate\n[01:27:53] that to your sense of worth. And so when\n[01:27:56] I first had the ability to pay for\n[01:27:58] anything for myself, yeah, I I I bought\n[01:28:00] the onbrand\n[01:28:02] cornflakes, you know, I bought the the\n[01:28:03] the onbrand\n[01:28:06] uh medication because to me that that\n[01:28:09] was equal to how I wanted others to\n[01:28:12] perceive me. And so when she realized\n[01:28:15] that, oh, it's not just me wanting to\n[01:28:17] splurge or have some kind of, you know,\n[01:28:20] you just think you\n[01:28:22] um have to buy the best. It was like,\n[01:28:24] no, that's actually it's a reflection of\n[01:28:26] when you buy me something nice, I feel\n[01:28:27] like you equate that to how much value I\n[01:28:31] I hold. I'm not worth buying something\n[01:28:33] nice for. And so it was related a lot to\n[01:28:36] my stuff. And we got to talk the same\n[01:28:38] about her stuff of why she doesn't want\n[01:28:41] to buy the thing. So, it's it's like\n[01:28:43] that having these super conversations\n[01:28:46] with your friend of why does it bother\n[01:28:47] her when she gets takes forever to get\n[01:28:50] dressed? Well, most likely it's related\n[01:28:52] to something in his past that's bothered\n[01:28:55] him that he's not seeing yet. Are the\n[01:28:58] conversation worth having? Yeah, I think\n[01:28:59] it's absolutely worth having. If it's\n[01:29:01] bothering you that much, yeah, if it's\n[01:29:04] hysterical, it's historical. I think\n[01:29:07] that's a really good point which is\n[01:29:08] we're all just dealing with\n[01:29:11] other people's inner child. Like we're\n[01:29:13] all dealing with it's just like me as a\n[01:29:14] child facing you as a child. I know we\n[01:29:16] look like adults now. I haven't got gray\n[01:29:18] hair but\n[01:29:18] >> yes\n[01:29:19] >> it's really still us just playing out\n[01:29:21] the stories and narratives from our\n[01:29:22] childhood oftent times.\n[01:29:23] >> You're exactly right. They they say in\n[01:29:24] therapy the worst thing about parents is\n[01:29:26] that they had parents. you know, I mean,\n[01:29:28] they they it's so easy for me just to\n[01:29:30] look at my mom and me forget that she\n[01:29:35] had parents, you know, that what they\n[01:29:37] did to her rather than me just looking\n[01:29:40] at what my parents have done to me, you\n[01:29:42] know, and and that's the definition of\n[01:29:44] the generational cycle. And it's\n[01:29:46] choosing to do something different with\n[01:29:50] with who you are and who you want to be\n[01:29:52] and who how you want to raise the next\n[01:29:54] generation. But we're it's it's all\n[01:29:56] survival skills. It's all childhood\n[01:30:00] trauma that's related. And when people I\n[01:30:02] have a section in my book of having\n[01:30:05] people define out\n[01:30:08] their own\n[01:30:10] the the communication skills they saw\n[01:30:12] growing up. Because most of the time if\n[01:30:14] you feel like arguments have to be this\n[01:30:17] big shouting match and everybody's\n[01:30:19] yelling and it's it's also typically\n[01:30:21] cultural, you know, of how certain\n[01:30:24] cultures how they argue and how loud it\n[01:30:26] is and if everybody versus there's some\n[01:30:29] cultures and families that it's very\n[01:30:32] quiet. Like I I I'll never forget going\n[01:30:35] to a friend's house when I was about\n[01:30:37] seven and his parents while we're eating\n[01:30:39] cereal like just had at it and I was\n[01:30:43] mortified like\n[01:30:44] >> arguing\n[01:30:45] >> arguing arguing\n[01:30:47] >> and I mean yelling at each other and I\n[01:30:51] am like bowling head mortified and my\n[01:30:53] friend is just eating cereal like hey\n[01:30:55] don't bother him whatsoever it's just\n[01:30:57] another Tuesday you know and whereas I\n[01:31:00] grew up with if my parents argued\n[01:31:03] it was going to be in their bedroom. You\n[01:31:05] know, I knew if they were going to they\n[01:31:07] went to close the door and they were\n[01:31:08] going to have a a conversation that they\n[01:31:10] didn't want us to hear. And so,\n[01:31:12] everybody has been modeled something\n[01:31:15] different where\n[01:31:17] like there's I've seen it on the\n[01:31:18] negative side where people feel like you\n[01:31:22] don't really love me unless you want to\n[01:31:23] fight with me. It's because that's all\n[01:31:26] they've been modeled, fights. They have\n[01:31:28] to say the most hurtful thing. They need\n[01:31:29] to be in tears. They need to be saying\n[01:31:31] horrible things to each other for them\n[01:31:33] to feel any kind of love. And I've also\n[01:31:36] seen it where people are wallflower.\n[01:31:38] They don't want to say anything. They\n[01:31:40] want to be really hesitant because bad\n[01:31:43] things happened when they spoke out at\n[01:31:45] home. They they realized that telling\n[01:31:48] the truth wasn't good for them. They\n[01:31:51] they they learned that lies protected\n[01:31:52] them.\n[01:31:53] >> It's interesting when you have one\n[01:31:54] parent that conducted themselves in a\n[01:31:56] certain way and the other parent was the\n[01:31:58] opposite.\n[01:31:58] >> Yeah. What then happens to you? Like\n[01:32:01] which communication style you then\n[01:32:02] adopt?\n[01:32:03] >> Which parent takes more of an interest\n[01:32:05] in you is where it typically goes. The\n[01:32:09] one you're most of the time with. And\n[01:32:12] see, I know people who their parents are\n[01:32:14] kind of absent, but they spend a lot of\n[01:32:16] time with their grandmother. And so I\n[01:32:18] know a guy who he sounds just like his\n[01:32:20] southern grandmother from Kentucky, you\n[01:32:23] know, because that's who he spent most\n[01:32:24] of his time with. And so it's it's who\n[01:32:28] takes the most interest in you. It's\n[01:32:30] it's where the parents\n[01:32:34] what I what I find so interesting in\n[01:32:38] communication we talk everything is\n[01:32:40] learned from how we were raised is at\n[01:32:44] one point in time there was utility to\n[01:32:45] what you were doing. There was a utility\n[01:32:47] to lying. It protected you. Protected\n[01:32:49] maybe your mom. It protected maybe your\n[01:32:51] dad. There's utility to it. There was a\n[01:32:53] utility to manipulating to be able to\n[01:32:56] say things weren't this way in order to\n[01:32:58] keep the family together. So there was a\n[01:33:01] utility to the very skill that you still\n[01:33:03] have and eventually it catches up with\n[01:33:04] you.\n[01:33:06] >> What is it about our communication do\n[01:33:08] you think that makes us accidentally\n[01:33:10] disliked by other people?\n[01:33:11] >> It sounds fake.\n[01:33:13] >> It sounds fake. And how does it sound\n[01:33:15] fake? Give me give me some color. Um, if\n[01:33:18] you want to know the secret if\n[01:33:20] somebody's being fake with you, there's\n[01:33:22] really three things that you got to\n[01:33:23] know. Number one, it's what I call\n[01:33:28] bestie bombing.\n[01:33:29] >> Bestie bombing.\n[01:33:30] >> Yeah. So, instead of like love bombing,\n[01:33:32] it's bestie bombing. I have people who\n[01:33:34] come to me all the time of I feel like\n[01:33:36] somebody's being fake with them. And\n[01:33:37] what they're doing is it's, \"Oh my gosh,\n[01:33:39] I just we're we're literally the same\n[01:33:40] person. Oh, I think we're best friends.\"\n[01:33:42] And it's we just met. Like I just we I\n[01:33:45] already talked we're just standing next\n[01:33:46] to each other at the same party and\n[01:33:47] they're like, \"Oh, we've got to go. Oh\n[01:33:49] my gosh, we you're my best. You're my\n[01:33:51] soulmate.\" And it's like they they give\n[01:33:53] way too much right out of the gate of\n[01:33:55] how much they love you.\n[01:33:57] >> Ah, yeah.\n[01:33:58] >> And it's it's nothing. It's not what\n[01:34:00] secure people do. Secure people don't\n[01:34:03] attach to you instantly.\n[01:34:04] >> Is that a form of manipulation?\n[01:34:06] >> No, it's a form of insecurity. It's it's\n[01:34:09] a form because if it would be\n[01:34:11] manipulation if they actually meant it,\n[01:34:14] but they don't. It's it's\n[01:34:17] these inauthentic relationships that all\n[01:34:21] of a sudden it's like, \"Oh my gosh, we\n[01:34:23] we're going to be best friends. I I love\n[01:34:25] you so much.\" And you're like, I I I'm\n[01:34:28] don't even know I don't even know your\n[01:34:29] last name. What are you What are you\n[01:34:30] talking about? So, you see that a lot.\n[01:34:33] Two is the over compliments. We all have\n[01:34:36] this sixth sense to be able to sniff out\n[01:34:40] if that's real or not. Like nobody needs\n[01:34:43] to teach you if it's a fake laugh or\n[01:34:45] not.\n[01:34:46] You know what I mean? Like Yeah.\n[01:34:48] [laughter] Right. I don't know. Was that\n[01:34:50] real or not, Stephen? Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:34:51] >> It's so funny. Yeah. Because we we think\n[01:34:53] we can spot everyone else's fake laugh\n[01:34:54] and then conspars.\n[01:34:55] >> Exactly. [laughter] Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:34:57] That's exactly right. It's like But\n[01:34:58] nobody had to teach that to you. Nobody\n[01:35:00] had to say, \"Hey, if you hear like this,\n[01:35:01] it's a fake laugh.\" No, no, no. We all\n[01:35:03] as humans it's we have an ability a\n[01:35:06] sense to go nah that didn't sound real\n[01:35:08] that's not a real smile you know people\n[01:35:10] have their like photo smile and the real\n[01:35:13] smile\n[01:35:14] >> and the same with the the the laughter\n[01:35:18] or like that's not that wasn't that\n[01:35:19] funny or they overcomplent something\n[01:35:22] they compliment your shoes I mean and\n[01:35:25] then they have really they go oh my gosh\n[01:35:27] I I I love that outfit and then all of a\n[01:35:28] sudden they've turned their head you\n[01:35:29] know what I mean they're not really\n[01:35:31] truly engaged in what it is it's just\n[01:35:33] it's it's a ritual to them of that's how\n[01:35:36] they have learned because to me if you\n[01:35:39] have to perfectly curate yourself this\n[01:35:42] this sense of perfection you you're not\n[01:35:44] getting the real human you're getting a\n[01:35:48] person in character you're getting them\n[01:35:51] in and scene you know they have to like\n[01:35:54] get into it and so it's it's um it's\n[01:35:58] something that's so so fake every every\n[01:36:00] single time and then I the third that\n[01:36:03] you have to watch out for are the people\n[01:36:06] that aren't willing to actually have an\n[01:36:09] interest in you.\n[01:36:11] Meaning they never ask anything about\n[01:36:13] you. They're only wanting to talk about\n[01:36:15] themselves. Like have you ever been in a\n[01:36:18] I know you have and you're networking in\n[01:36:20] a big room and somebody's looking at you\n[01:36:21] and all of a sudden they're looking at\n[01:36:22] the room like they're they're looking\n[01:36:25] for who they're going to talk to next\n[01:36:27] and you've lost them. And so it's like,\n[01:36:29] why? We're both just kind of here saying\n[01:36:31] things. We're going to slow down our\n[01:36:33] words so it's not as awkward. And you\n[01:36:35] say things like, \"Yeah, that's that's\n[01:36:37] crazy.\" Yeah. And like while you're both\n[01:36:40] looking for somebody else to talk to,\n[01:36:42] but that's what happens. You realize you\n[01:36:44] stay you come out of focus and they\n[01:36:45] they're looking for the next person. A\n[01:36:47] really um surprising point of uh\n[01:36:50] feedback or compliment someone gave me\n[01:36:52] once and it's surprising because I never\n[01:36:54] considered it to be something that\n[01:36:55] people were noticing is when I do like\n[01:36:57] meet and greets and you're meeting say\n[01:36:59] 100 people before or after a talk or\n[01:37:00] whatever and they're coming up one one\n[01:37:02] at a time.\n[01:37:04] >> I will get DMs in the preceding days of\n[01:37:08] people telling me that they liked the\n[01:37:10] way that they watched me pay attention\n[01:37:13] to someone else.\n[01:37:14] >> Do you get this\n[01:37:15] >> all the time? Yeah. They're watching how\n[01:37:18] how interested you are in the person\n[01:37:20] that's talking to you.\n[01:37:21] >> And I didn't I didn't obviously it's not\n[01:37:23] something I'd thought about before until\n[01:37:25] probably had about 20 messages over the\n[01:37:26] last year or two from people saying and\n[01:37:29] do you know what I noticed even how much\n[01:37:31] you were paying attention to the person\n[01:37:32] that spoke to you. Not to them. They\n[01:37:34] were in the line waiting. [laughter] But\n[01:37:36] it's the per and I just thought that's\n[01:37:37] so interesting that we judge\n[01:37:39] >> other people by how they interact with\n[01:37:41] >> other people while we're watching as\n[01:37:43] well.\n[01:37:43] >> Right. And that being interested is seen\n[01:37:46] as makes you likable. I guess\n[01:37:49] >> presence is the highest form of\n[01:37:52] authenticity.\n[01:37:53] >> Like I can talk to you, but am I here\n[01:37:55] with you?\n[01:37:56] >> Am I do I have my eyes with you? Am I am\n[01:37:58] I interested in you? Am I going to am I\n[01:38:02] easily distracted? Am I have my phone?\n[01:38:04] Am I am I really paying attention? Or am\n[01:38:07] I making sure that you know you are the\n[01:38:09] most important thing that's happening in\n[01:38:11] this moment? Even if it's a glimmer and\n[01:38:13] even if it's for 30, 20 seconds and\n[01:38:16] you're doing a meet and greet and you're\n[01:38:18] saying hi or you're signing their book,\n[01:38:20] do you ask them their name? Do you use\n[01:38:23] their name? Do you look at them with\n[01:38:25] intent of true genuine thank you for\n[01:38:27] being here? None of this would happen if\n[01:38:29] not for you. People are watching the\n[01:38:31] whole time and they they they know. I\n[01:38:35] mean, it's it's it's such a\n[01:38:38] >> it's like what you know it when you feel\n[01:38:40] it kind of thing. And to me, it's it's\n[01:38:42] presence. Am I am I truly here with you?\n[01:38:44] Okay. Because even at the house, you\n[01:38:46] know, you can say, \"Well, I'm home all\n[01:38:48] the time, but are you are you just\n[01:38:50] looking on your phone? Are you just\n[01:38:51] sitting on the couch? Are you always\n[01:38:53] reading? Are you that's not presence?\"\n[01:38:56] >> I'm going to play this video on the\n[01:38:58] screen for anyone that's uh watching the\n[01:39:00] video. Okay.\n[01:39:00] >> But it it immediately made me think of\n[01:39:02] um this clip that went viral of Miley\n[01:39:05] Cyrus and Amy Campbell.\n[01:39:06] >> Oh, I haven't seen this. They were doing\n[01:39:08] a meet and greet\n[01:39:10] together and they were just chatting to\n[01:39:12] each other and kind of ignoring the\n[01:39:13] fans. And you can\n[01:39:17] be\n[01:39:25] >> I just remember thinking this is like\n[01:39:27] the antithesis of what we've just said.\n[01:39:30] >> It's painful to watch. I know it's\n[01:39:32] painful for the people. I mean I it's\n[01:39:34] several layers of where\n[01:39:38] one, it's an area of really little\n[01:39:41] forgiveness.\n[01:39:42] You know, if you think of somebody of of\n[01:39:44] her caliber, so to say, of like her\n[01:39:47] celebrity, right? Seen thousands,\n[01:39:49] millions, it's happened. And is there\n[01:39:52] really room for just having a\n[01:39:54] conversation with somebody like if I if\n[01:39:56] you're her, how do you what would be the\n[01:39:59] justification? Right? If you could just\n[01:40:00] pause and say, \"What is it?\" Maybe you\n[01:40:02] say, \"Well, there isn't any.\" Okay,\n[01:40:04] that's fine. But let's say one, when it\n[01:40:06] comes to presence, there's really not\n[01:40:09] any room for\n[01:40:11] forgiveness. It's it's either you're\n[01:40:14] present with them or you're you're not\n[01:40:15] because this kind of thing can last\n[01:40:17] forever. Second of all, people will\n[01:40:21] forget what you did, but they'll never\n[01:40:23] forget how you made them feel.\n[01:40:26] And\n[01:40:27] people will remember you, Stephen, of\n[01:40:30] they will tell their kids and their\n[01:40:32] grandkids of the time that they met you\n[01:40:35] and how nice you were, how present you\n[01:40:37] were, and how you were genuinely\n[01:40:40] interested in them. And that makes all\n[01:40:43] the difference. If you have one slip up,\n[01:40:46] that's when I say it's it's it's not\n[01:40:48] very forgivable. When when you have one\n[01:40:50] slip up, it's showing applied to all\n[01:40:52] because if you can do it to them, you\n[01:40:54] can do it to me. The slip up will also\n[01:40:56] travel much further.\n[01:40:57] >> Faster too.\n[01:40:58] >> Yeah. Faster. F\n[01:40:59] >> because I guarantee you, you know, you\n[01:41:01] think of all the meet and greets that\n[01:41:03] somebody like that has had and has had\n[01:41:05] genuine real interest. They they mess up\n[01:41:07] one time, they get tired one time. Well,\n[01:41:10] then all of a sudden that's what travels\n[01:41:12] way faster. So, but the thing is that\n[01:41:15] that's why I say presence is the highest\n[01:41:17] form of authenticity because if you can\n[01:41:20] take that moment to be truly interested\n[01:41:22] in somebody because who am I? You know,\n[01:41:25] I'm I'm a guy from a small town who made\n[01:41:27] videos in my car and you're going to\n[01:41:29] come to my book signing and you traveled\n[01:41:31] and you flew in two hours. Like, why\n[01:41:33] would I not? Hold up. Take the line. Let\n[01:41:35] me spend three minutes with you. Can I\n[01:41:37] give three minutes of my life to talk to\n[01:41:38] you? What are you doing here? And so\n[01:41:41] when you have\n[01:41:44] that humility and there's several people\n[01:41:47] I know you know many names of they they\n[01:41:51] forgot how they got what they got.\n[01:41:53] >> Oh yeah. I have a really interesting\n[01:41:56] example of this recently where we\n[01:41:58] appointed a new chairman to our company.\n[01:42:00] >> He's called Nikki\n[01:42:02] >> and um incredible guy. He's been at like\n[01:42:05] he'd been proctor and gamble doing\n[01:42:07] product for I don't know 12 years. then\n[01:42:08] went to Boston Consulting Group and was\n[01:42:11] one of the senior figures at Boston\n[01:42:12] Consulting Group for 25 years. And you\n[01:42:15] know, he's in the the home stretch of\n[01:42:18] his career.\n[01:42:18] >> Mhm.\n[01:42:19] >> And he joined our company\n[01:42:22] and\n[01:42:24] he is, you know, he he's achieved so\n[01:42:26] much. He's he's worked with the biggest\n[01:42:27] the best in the world globally,\n[01:42:29] >> right?\n[01:42:30] >> So, he's got the right, one would say,\n[01:42:32] >> I like that,\n[01:42:33] >> to be a certain way. That's what someone\n[01:42:35] might say. But I'm over here in Los\n[01:42:38] Angeles. Um, he joins the company as\n[01:42:40] chairman. And the interesting thing, the\n[01:42:44] interesting feedback I got, I know 5,000\n[01:42:46] miles away was a very junior member of\n[01:42:49] the team came up to me and said, \"Oh, I\n[01:42:51] love Nikki.\" And I was like, \"Explain.\"\n[01:42:54] And he went, he sat down with me and\n[01:42:57] gave me an hour of his time.\n[01:42:59] That was the reason he loved him.\n[01:43:01] >> That was it.\n[01:43:01] >> That was it. It was presence. and and\n[01:43:04] what what I I [clears throat] later\n[01:43:06] found out was that Nikki went into the\n[01:43:07] company and there is hundreds of people\n[01:43:09] and he sat down with every single one of\n[01:43:11] them regardless of whether you're an\n[01:43:12] intern or whether you're the CEO and it\n[01:43:15] always it's always stayed with me how\n[01:43:16] much that has mattered how much that has\n[01:43:20] shaped his perception just disproport\n[01:43:21] he's brilliant and everything but\n[01:43:23] disproportionately shaped his perception\n[01:43:25] just by giving someone the most valuable\n[01:43:27] thing which is just their time.\n[01:43:28] >> Yes. And um I mean maybe it's a a story\n[01:43:32] of how to be a good partner. Maybe it's\n[01:43:35] a story of how to [laughter] be in the\n[01:43:37] public eye,\n[01:43:38] >> right?\n[01:43:38] >> Maybe it's also a story of how to be a\n[01:43:39] great colleague or team member or\n[01:43:40] leader.\n[01:43:41] >> Yeah. Or just a great human. Yeah.\n[01:43:43] [laughter] I I think there is um when\n[01:43:47] you're always in the habit of giving,\n[01:43:50] giving then feels a lot like receiving.\n[01:43:52] So when I'm giving my time, it also\n[01:43:55] feels like I'm receiving that time back.\n[01:43:58] when I can continually have that spirit\n[01:44:01] and you have that knowledge of\n[01:44:05] humility. They say, \"What does humility\n[01:44:07] mean?\" It it means you realize that you\n[01:44:09] are just as weird and terrible as\n[01:44:11] everybody else. When you realize I I'm\n[01:44:15] I'm the chief worst person there is. No,\n[01:44:18] I'm not better than a single person that\n[01:44:20] is in line to to do or attend something\n[01:44:23] or sit in an audience. I I am no better.\n[01:44:27] I've just been through a lot. Still been\n[01:44:30] through a lot. And so I know a lot. And\n[01:44:32] when you have that mindset of\n[01:44:35] I want to meet and touch every single\n[01:44:37] person. If I were to come in here\n[01:44:40] and\n[01:44:42] only talk to you, but not talk to your\n[01:44:45] team,\n[01:44:46] [clears throat] what's what do you think\n[01:44:47] that's going to do when you can go\n[01:44:50] somewhere and not just talk to who's the\n[01:44:53] most popular,\n[01:44:54] but also talk to who's the least? Like\n[01:44:57] it's it is you will always get way more.\n[01:45:01] and for yourself and for the other\n[01:45:03] person when you can lower yourself to\n[01:45:05] say, \"Hey, we're just humans in a room.\n[01:45:08] How's it going?\"\n[01:45:09] >> It's interesting that we um we're\n[01:45:11] figuring people out by how we observe\n[01:45:14] them vicariously. We were talking about\n[01:45:15] it in the context of like a meet and\n[01:45:16] greet a second ago. Yeah.\n[01:45:17] >> What you said there tracks perfectly\n[01:45:19] with with that, which is when you walked\n[01:45:21] in the room, you didn't just speak to\n[01:45:22] me, you also asked Berta, who's\n[01:45:25] recording the podcast today, what her\n[01:45:27] name was. And then you said to Berta,\n[01:45:29] you said, \"Thank you for doing this.\"\n[01:45:31] right\n[01:45:31] >> now. Isn't it funny that I remember?\n[01:45:32] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:45:33] >> Isn't it funny that that was like two\n[01:45:34] and a half hours ago and I remember\n[01:45:36] because it was really memorable to me\n[01:45:38] that you did that\n[01:45:39] >> because not everybody does that. Not\n[01:45:41] everybody will, you know, notice that\n[01:45:42] >> B is in the room with us and she's\n[01:45:44] running all these cameras and she's\n[01:45:45] putting it together. But for some\n[01:45:46] reason, just before we started\n[01:45:46] recording, you made a point of asking\n[01:45:48] her what her name was and then\n[01:45:50] >> and then thanking her for doing this\n[01:45:51] today. Yeah.\n[01:45:52] >> Most people don't do that.\n[01:45:54] >> And as you walk away from today, I'm not\n[01:45:56] going to remember like that you you\n[01:45:57] walked in and said something nice about\n[01:45:58] me or whatever. The most shocking thing\n[01:46:01] and therefore the most memorable because\n[01:46:02] it is the most unusual\n[01:46:04] >> because it is typically the most\n[01:46:05] overlooked is you acknowledging the\n[01:46:09] other people.\n[01:46:10] >> Yeah.\n[01:46:10] >> And um\n[01:46:13] I've noticed this as a paradox that I\n[01:46:15] almost need to put words to, but I I\n[01:46:16] remember\n[01:46:18] in something I wrote a long time ago\n[01:46:21] saying how useless absurdity will define\n[01:46:23] you more than useful practicality. And\n[01:46:25] what I mean by that is the example I was\n[01:46:27] giving was in the context of my old gym\n[01:46:30] where they have this massive climbing\n[01:46:31] wall in the entrance. And I came home to\n[01:46:33] my girlfriend and said, \"There's this\n[01:46:34] incredible gym. It's massive. They even\n[01:46:37] have a 100 foot climbing wall in the\n[01:46:38] entrance.\" What I'm doing is I'm\n[01:46:40] pointing at the most absurd thing to\n[01:46:43] give you a shortcut that tells you\n[01:46:45] everything about that gym. Now, if I\n[01:46:48] point at the most absurd thing, you know\n[01:46:49] the gym is big.\n[01:46:50] >> Oh, I got chills. Yeah. Yeah. So good.\n[01:46:52] Yes. If I say there's 100 foot climbing\n[01:46:53] wall, you know, there's lots of running\n[01:46:54] machines,\n[01:46:55] >> right?\n[01:46:55] >> So, if I if I when I leave here and go,\n[01:46:57] he was so nice. He even spoke to Ber and\n[01:46:59] um thanked her for doing the podcast.\n[01:47:01] I'm using that as a shortcut because\n[01:47:03] it's the most standout absurd thing to\n[01:47:06] tell other people everything about you.\n[01:47:08] >> Yes. I love that.\n[01:47:09] >> And this is why we should value the the\n[01:47:11] seemingly petty and seemingly small and\n[01:47:12] seemingly inconsequential because other\n[01:47:14] people don't. Therefore, it creates\n[01:47:16] maximal impact.\n[01:47:18] >> Yes. That that's why the big\n[01:47:20] conversations rarely matter. the small\n[01:47:21] ones do. It's the small ones with\n[01:47:23] strangers. It's the conversations you\n[01:47:25] don't have on the stage. It's the\n[01:47:26] conversations you have in your driveway.\n[01:47:28] It's the conversations you have in your\n[01:47:29] backyard at the coffee shop. It's it's\n[01:47:31] the conversations you have to somebody\n[01:47:33] passing by in the elevator. Like, it's\n[01:47:35] those that that's what defines the human\n[01:47:39] experience. If I were to text you a\n[01:47:43] compliment, right? That's one thing. But\n[01:47:45] if I were to say, \"Hey, I just finished\n[01:47:48] lunch with soand so who you also know. I\n[01:47:50] got to tell you, this person loves you\n[01:47:52] so much and and I share with you what\n[01:47:54] they said about you, you're going to\n[01:47:55] take that differently.\n[01:47:56] >> If I wanted to give you, let's say if\n[01:47:58] someone want to give me a gift, right?\n[01:48:00] But instead, they didn't give it to me,\n[01:48:01] they gave it to my kids.\n[01:48:04] >> I mean, that's h how much more would\n[01:48:06] that define how much they care,\n[01:48:08] >> right? It it's anytime I go on a a\n[01:48:11] stage, I make it a priority that I know\n[01:48:14] the guy who's or girl who's putting on\n[01:48:16] my the AV system, the lapel mic, the\n[01:48:19] everything. I want to know their name. I\n[01:48:21] know how how many times they've done\n[01:48:23] this today, how they're doing because\n[01:48:25] it's so easy just to turn and keep\n[01:48:28] talking to who's important while and act\n[01:48:29] like they're just doing it. Like it's\n[01:48:32] when you can truly talk to the people\n[01:48:37] that's just a regular person and forget\n[01:48:39] that you you don't have to just stick to\n[01:48:40] the somebodyodies. You don't have to\n[01:48:42] look always for the somebodyodies. I\n[01:48:44] used to say that I again this comes from\n[01:48:46] employing a lot of people that we all\n[01:48:47] have invisible PR\n[01:48:49] >> and it's and it shows up in the moments\n[01:48:51] that matters the most but it's built in\n[01:48:53] the moments that seem to matter the\n[01:48:54] least.\n[01:48:55] >> Yeah. And the example I always think of\n[01:48:57] is being working in the New York office\n[01:48:59] um many years ago and getting a message\n[01:49:02] from my team member just saying, \"Oh,\n[01:49:03] Jenny's so nice. She just Tim tripped\n[01:49:06] over and Jenny immediately got up from\n[01:49:08] her desk and ran across uh to the first\n[01:49:10] aid kit and sorted him out. She's so\n[01:49:12] nice.\" And I'd hear that 3,000 miles\n[01:49:14] away. And then a year later, I'd be sat\n[01:49:16] with Jenny during her promotion\n[01:49:18] conversation.\n[01:49:19] >> Yeah. And that one thing she did, that\n[01:49:23] small thing she did was often the time\n[01:49:25] where I'd go, you know what, this person\n[01:49:26] is a certain type of person and we\n[01:49:28] should\n[01:49:29] >> double down on them. And then I've got\n[01:49:30] the opposite as well.\n[01:49:32] >> I've got the a little thing someone did\n[01:49:34] to someone who was not necessarily their\n[01:49:37] line manager or significant.\n[01:49:39] >> Yeah.\n[01:49:40] >> And it, you know, and even things that\n[01:49:43] happened to me years ago when I came up\n[01:49:45] to I walked up to someone famous. I've\n[01:49:48] told this story. It's so crazy. I told\n[01:49:49] this story on the podcast like episode\n[01:49:51] three [laughter] and no one listened and\n[01:49:54] then um like 3 four years later the\n[01:49:57] podcast got bigger and people started\n[01:49:58] listening to people go back to the old\n[01:50:00] episodes.\n[01:50:00] >> Mhm.\n[01:50:01] >> And this famous person tweeted me like\n[01:50:03] four years later I was like I heard\n[01:50:04] you're talking about me in the UK blah\n[01:50:05] blah blah blah blah.\n[01:50:07] >> But I was I was just sharing as an\n[01:50:08] example for like invisible PR where\n[01:50:10] someone I'd gone up to someone famous\n[01:50:11] and asked them a question and they just\n[01:50:14] like\n[01:50:15] >> bang. Yeah.\n[01:50:16] >> Like laid into me.\n[01:50:18] >> Right. And I and I, you know, I don't\n[01:50:20] know what they're going through that\n[01:50:20] day, but it it always, you know,\n[01:50:22] >> well, that's but that brings it around\n[01:50:24] like full circle because like we just\n[01:50:27] said, you can have those little moments\n[01:50:29] where it's it's the rock wall, right?\n[01:50:32] Where little moments of connection, of\n[01:50:34] presence, of real authenticity, of them\n[01:50:37] being with you that you'll remember\n[01:50:38] forever.\n[01:50:40] And I bet if I had to guess, there's a\n[01:50:42] moment in Steven at the playground\n[01:50:45] growing up that or a teacher, somebody\n[01:50:48] in your life said something that was\n[01:50:50] nice and you've remembered forever.\n[01:50:52] >> Oh, yeah.\n[01:50:54] >> But I\n[01:50:56] would also venture a bit.\n[01:50:57] >> Yes. Before you've even said, I could I\n[01:50:58] thought of the moment\n[01:51:00] >> that Okay.\n[01:51:01] >> Playground Steven where somebody said\n[01:51:03] something hurtful.\n[01:51:05] >> Yeah.\n[01:51:06] >> Or rude or said something about how you\n[01:51:08] look or your appearance. Maybe not even\n[01:51:10] recess, but sometime in your life.\n[01:51:11] >> Oh yeah.\n[01:51:12] >> And it was just something maybe it was\n[01:51:14] about for a lot of people it's like\n[01:51:16] their weight or their appearance or\n[01:51:17] their looks and they've carried that\n[01:51:20] around with them forever and that like\n[01:51:22] without knowing it that person gave you\n[01:51:24] an insecurity for the rest of your life.\n[01:51:27] And so it's so wild to me how the\n[01:51:30] positive is remembered,\n[01:51:32] the negative is remembered much longer\n[01:51:36] and travels a lot farther. And I mean\n[01:51:38] it's when I ask that to a group that I'm\n[01:51:41] talking to, those hands are always way\n[01:51:44] more raised for the negative, for the\n[01:51:46] one thing that the power of your words\n[01:51:49] lasts way longer than you'd ever think.\n[01:51:52] The ripple effect will affect people\n[01:51:54] you've never met. I mean, you think\n[01:51:56] think of the people who you've touched\n[01:51:58] and the people you've never met, but yet\n[01:52:00] they have a perception of you based\n[01:52:03] three persons down,\n[01:52:05] >> right? And how I talk to my kids will\n[01:52:08] affect how they talk to their kids and\n[01:52:09] their kids. Children I'll never meet.\n[01:52:12] And when you realize that how I talk to\n[01:52:15] the person behind the cashier affects\n[01:52:18] how he or she talks to their kids when\n[01:52:21] they go home based on what I said will\n[01:52:25] determine whether they come home and\n[01:52:26] say, \"I had a really bad day. I had a\n[01:52:28] really hard day and it it's because of\n[01:52:30] what I said because I was rude or I was\n[01:52:33] impatient because they didn't get it to\n[01:52:35] me fast enough and all of a sudden\n[01:52:37] without knowing just as much as the\n[01:52:39] positive lasts so does the negative.\n[01:52:40] It's now I what I chose to say is\n[01:52:44] responsible for how they're treating\n[01:52:45] their own kids.\n[01:52:46] >> And that's what how we are as humans,\n[01:52:48] right? Like we um the reason why we\n[01:52:50] survived is because we're good at\n[01:52:51] gossip.\n[01:52:52] >> That too.\n[01:52:53] >> We're good at passing on stories. So,\n[01:52:55] you know, I could tell people before\n[01:52:56] they met you if you were a risk.\n[01:52:58] >> No. Yeah.\n[01:52:59] >> I could, you know, don't go near him.\n[01:53:00] Don't go near that cave. There's a\n[01:53:01] >> threat person in there that's going to\n[01:53:03] kill us. So,\n[01:53:04] >> right.\n[01:53:04] >> It's a survival adaptation, I guess, in\n[01:53:06] some respects to be gossipy and to pass\n[01:53:08] on people's reputations.\n[01:53:09] >> But we've always asked what's the news?\n[01:53:12] >> You know, people going through town from\n[01:53:13] town to town. You you didn't you didn't\n[01:53:15] really have a paper. It's do you have\n[01:53:16] any news?\n[01:53:18] So, I'm going to push you to close to\n[01:53:20] give me the five things that you think\n[01:53:22] are most important for anyone who's\n[01:53:25] striving to be a masterful communicator,\n[01:53:29] conversationalist\n[01:53:30] to get what they want out of life, which\n[01:53:33] is really what I think is it is the last\n[01:53:35] domino when we talk about body language\n[01:53:37] or communication tactics or all the\n[01:53:38] things we're talking about. I think\n[01:53:39] people are trying to get something out\n[01:53:40] of life, whether it's to have a better\n[01:53:42] relationship or to\n[01:53:45] be respected or what, get a promotion,\n[01:53:47] to be successful. I think that's\n[01:53:49] probably the the output we're looking\n[01:53:50] for\n[01:53:51] >> ultimately. Do you agree with that? I\n[01:53:53] don't want to like what is it that\n[01:53:55] what's the last domino that people are\n[01:53:57] looking for when they talk about this\n[01:53:58] stuff up here?\n[01:54:00] >> Selfworth.\n[01:54:01] >> Selfworth. Okay.\n[01:54:02] >> Am I Am I enough?\n[01:54:04] >> Am I enough? Okay.\n[01:54:07] So what are the what are the five most\n[01:54:09] important things to summarize if you had\n[01:54:10] to give me five.\n[01:54:12] >> The first is authenticity.\n[01:54:16] If I cannot be genuine with you, if I\n[01:54:18] cannot be real with you, then I can be\n[01:54:21] nobody to you.\n[01:54:22] >> And on authenticity,\n[01:54:24] you know, on your bad day, are you still\n[01:54:26] authentic at work?\n[01:54:28] >> Yes.\n[01:54:28] >> Like if you're if you're really, you\n[01:54:31] know, having a [clears throat] bad day,\n[01:54:32] do you show up to work as your authentic\n[01:54:33] self?\n[01:54:35] >> I would say yes. I mean, there's\n[01:54:36] obviously certain parameters that are\n[01:54:38] within social norms of just because I'm\n[01:54:41] having a a bad time and in a bad mood,\n[01:54:42] does that give me a right to rip you a\n[01:54:45] new one? Uh, just because you said hello\n[01:54:47] to me that morning, you know? No. But I\n[01:54:50] I think that there is certainly a space\n[01:54:52] to say, don't act h like you're happy\n[01:54:55] when you're not.\n[01:54:56] >> What about lying? Is that a violation of\n[01:54:58] authenticity? So, a colleague comes up\n[01:54:59] to me, they say, \"What do you think of\n[01:55:01] my new\n[01:55:03] haircut?\" And you think it's terrible?\n[01:55:05] Yeah.\n[01:55:05] >> What you What' you say?\n[01:55:08] >> It's an interesting choice. [laughter]\n[01:55:10] Probably is what I'd say.\n[01:55:11] >> So, you wouldn't lie.\n[01:55:12] >> No, I wouldn't. I would probably change\n[01:55:14] it to where it's I'm glad that they like\n[01:55:17] it. You know, I I don't have to like it\n[01:55:19] for you to give it any type of worth. If\n[01:55:21] you like it, that's awesome.\n[01:55:23] >> And authenticity as a strategy builds\n[01:55:26] trust over time. So, that's a long-term\n[01:55:28] game, I guess.\n[01:55:29] >> Yeah. No, I I came across some research\n[01:55:32] uh recently where it was in social\n[01:55:34] settings, those that are more authentic\n[01:55:36] are also the ones that are more trusted\n[01:55:38] and the ones you want to be around more.\n[01:55:41] >> Why do people struggle with\n[01:55:42] authenticity? It goes back to this point\n[01:55:43] about people pleasing, I guess. But\n[01:55:45] there is a certain type of person, I\n[01:55:47] think, that probably struggles to just\n[01:55:48] be,\n[01:55:51] you know, just to show up in all the\n[01:55:53] ways that they\n[01:55:55] they are to be themselves. They grew up\n[01:56:00] in places that weren't safe,\n[01:56:03] whether physically or emotionally.\n[01:56:06] They they grew up unsafe. And so they're\n[01:56:09] always tense. They're always anxious.\n[01:56:12] They're always worried about the next\n[01:56:13] shoe to drop. They can't rest.\n[01:56:17] You see people that had come from very\n[01:56:21] hard, harsh environments.\n[01:56:23] you'll see the survival skills that have\n[01:56:26] come out of that. Um,\n[01:56:29] it's because they they simply didn't\n[01:56:31] have a place to be safe.\n[01:56:35] >> Number two,\n[01:56:37] >> reduce the amount of distraction.\n[01:56:40] >> Reduce distraction. Is that the same as\n[01:56:43] saying like increase presence?\n[01:56:45] >> Well, that is the the benefit of it.\n[01:56:48] Yeah.\n[01:56:49] If you want to increase your presence,\n[01:56:51] you have to eliminate distractions. And\n[01:56:53] that means eliminate how often you're on\n[01:56:55] your phone.\n[01:56:56] >> I've got some thread here. Do you know\n[01:56:58] why this is here?\n[01:57:00] >> Yes.\n[01:57:01] >> Well, you explain.\n[01:57:02] >> Well, I mean, so just a piece of very\n[01:57:05] pretty red string. And this string is\n[01:57:09] going to represent the connection\n[01:57:10] between the two of us. So, give you the\n[01:57:12] end of it. What I just gave you is a\n[01:57:14] piece of string. And it connects between\n[01:57:18] your hand and my hand. And it's taught\n[01:57:19] right now. So this string right now\n[01:57:21] represents the connection between us in\n[01:57:24] conversation.\n[01:57:25] >> It's tight.\n[01:57:26] >> It's very tight. I'm going to ask\n[01:57:28] questions throughout this that don't\n[01:57:30] think about how what the right answer\n[01:57:33] is. Just go with what your gut instinct\n[01:57:36] of how it feels. So right now it's\n[01:57:38] tight. And if I look at you in the eye\n[01:57:40] and I say, \"Stephen, how's it going,\n[01:57:42] man?\"\n[01:57:43] >> It's going good. Yeah.\n[01:57:44] >> Yeah. What was something that frustrated\n[01:57:45] you yesterday?\n[01:57:46] >> My haircut didn't go to plan. Tell me\n[01:57:48] about it.\n[01:57:50] >> It's just not It's not good. I don't\n[01:57:51] like it.\n[01:57:52] >> Do you find that some of the the biggest\n[01:57:55] struggles you had yesterday was mostly\n[01:57:56] with business or personal or Tell me\n[01:57:59] something with business.\n[01:58:00] >> Um [sighs] the struggles with business\n[01:58:02] yesterday.\n[01:58:03] >> Yeah.\n[01:58:05] >> Oh, go ahead.\n[01:58:06] >> Okay. So, you're on your phone now and\n[01:58:08] the connection has been reduced.\n[01:58:12] >> Um\n[01:58:12] >> Yeah. So, I just pulled out my phone and\n[01:58:15] now I'm looking. And what did you feel\n[01:58:17] in the line?\n[01:58:18] >> I felt like the tightness went it went\n[01:58:21] loose.\n[01:58:21] >> Yeah, it went slack. Right. And but\n[01:58:23] that's the physical. What was\n[01:58:25] emotionally? How did that feel?\n[01:58:27] >> It felt disrespectful.\n[01:58:28] >> Yeah. And see if I had just both had\n[01:58:30] both hands on it like this. Now let's\n[01:58:34] put it taught again and I'm talking to\n[01:58:36] you and I say, \"So what's what are you\n[01:58:38] looking forward to this weekend?\"\n[01:58:40] >> I'm looking forward to\n[01:58:43] >> No, go ahead. And this is me just turn.\n[01:58:44] It's still tight. Don't worry. It's I\n[01:58:46] still am connected to you, you know.\n[01:58:47] Don't worry about it. I'm I'm right\n[01:58:48] here. Go ahead. Yeah. [laughter]\n[01:58:50] Exactly. You see how all of a sudden you\n[01:58:51] wanted to let go now.\n[01:58:52] >> Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:58:53] >> Yeah. For anybody listening. So you we\n[01:58:55] both had it tight. I look at my phone\n[01:58:57] while still holding it tight where I'm\n[01:58:58] saying, \"No, no, I'm listening. Go right\n[01:59:00] ahead.\" And all of a sudden, you are the\n[01:59:02] one that let go of the line.\n[01:59:04] >> Yeah.\n[01:59:04] >> Isn't that something? Because all of a\n[01:59:05] sudden, you gave up on the conversation.\n[01:59:08] You didn't want to be in it anymore.\n[01:59:09] What do you typically do if somebody's\n[01:59:11] at dinner with you and they pull out\n[01:59:13] their phone?\n[01:59:14] >> I mean, you look away or you can speak\n[01:59:16] to someone else or you\n[01:59:17] >> or you pull out your phone.\n[01:59:18] >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n[01:59:19] >> Exactly. You It's like they've given you\n[01:59:21] permission to now pick up their phone.\n[01:59:24] Somebody gets on theirs and you don't\n[01:59:26] want to look awkward or odd. So, what\n[01:59:27] you you get out yours and next thing you\n[01:59:29] know, both of you are on your phones at\n[01:59:32] dinner where you're supposed to be\n[01:59:33] communicating with each other and you're\n[01:59:35] just staring at your phone. Do you think\n[01:59:38] I sometimes think this with me being an\n[01:59:40] interviewer having this iPad in front of\n[01:59:41] me, I'm like, should I get rid of the\n[01:59:42] iPad?\n[01:59:44] >> Maybe I should because I write things\n[01:59:45] down while someone's speaking to me and\n[01:59:47] I I do worry sometimes that if I'm like\n[01:59:50] looking at a particular point or fact or\n[01:59:52] whatever that I'm\n[01:59:53] >> It's a little bit different. So, there's\n[01:59:55] a part of this that is it's it's a\n[01:59:58] production. We have cameras. We have\n[01:59:59] lights. Like, this isn't a normal just\n[02:00:02] if you and I were having coffee. But\n[02:00:03] let's say you and I were having lunch\n[02:00:06] and I'm talking like this to you and I\n[02:00:09] put my phone right here.\n[02:00:12] >> Do you feel a difference?\n[02:00:13] >> Yeah, I do. Yeah.\n[02:00:13] >> Do you feel I'm more connected or less\n[02:00:14] connected?\n[02:00:15] >> Less connected.\n[02:00:15] >> Yeah. And if I\n[02:00:16] >> am mixed priorities, not the priority.\n[02:00:18] >> Do you feel any different if I flip it\n[02:00:20] over?\n[02:00:20] >> Yes, I do.\n[02:00:21] >> And my face is it's it's down.\n[02:00:22] >> Yes, I do. It's a signal\n[02:00:24] >> of\n[02:00:25] >> that you think this is more important\n[02:00:27] and you don't want to be distracted.\n[02:00:29] >> Imagine what would you feel like if\n[02:00:33] you were on a date or got together with\n[02:00:36] a friend\n[02:00:38] >> and you just said, \"Hey, where's your\n[02:00:40] phone?\" He said, \"Oh, I just left it in\n[02:00:41] the car. I just wanted to sit with you.\"\n[02:00:43] >> Yes. Incredible.\n[02:00:45] >> Does anybody do that?\n[02:00:46] >> No.\n[02:00:46] >> No. Nobody does that. But imagine\n[02:00:48] imagine if right now there was uh let's\n[02:00:52] say a woman is about to go on a date and\n[02:00:55] she asked a guy, \"Where's your phone?\"\n[02:00:57] And he goes, \"Oh, I left it in the left\n[02:00:59] it in the car.\"\n[02:01:00] I mean, what kind of\n[02:01:02] >> You think it was kind of weird?\n[02:01:03] >> Yeah. Almost like what? You mean you\n[02:01:05] want to be solely interested in me? I'm\n[02:01:08] signaling that there is nothing else\n[02:01:09] more important than what's going on\n[02:01:10] right here.\n[02:01:11] >> So, that's so such atypical behavior.\n[02:01:13] Some people might see it as a red flag.\n[02:01:14] >> I No, that's probably true. But if I\n[02:01:16] have it here, even if I put it face down\n[02:01:19] on the table and I'm talking to you,\n[02:01:21] >> I'm at least still having my world, my\n[02:01:24] business, my stress, my chaos. It's my\n[02:01:26] It's my pacifier. You don't you're not\n[02:01:28] going to ask me to take away my blanket,\n[02:01:29] are you?\n[02:01:30] >> Yeah.\n[02:01:30] >> And so I'm still it's still there in the\n[02:01:32] conversation with us. So even if I put\n[02:01:34] it down or I put it between my legs or I\n[02:01:36] put it in my pocket, which I think is\n[02:01:37] much better of not letting it come out\n[02:01:40] at all, but it's what's the strength of\n[02:01:44] the connection? Because we've all been\n[02:01:46] that person like we just showed with the\n[02:01:48] string where they get out their phone\n[02:01:50] while you're talking and like Mhm. Yeah.\n[02:01:52] Yeah. Uh-huh. Right. Go ahead. And you\n[02:01:54] go, I don't want this.\n[02:01:55] >> Yeah. you let go because it's like\n[02:01:57] that's this isn't real this isn't real\n[02:01:58] connection. So if you want to be a\n[02:02:00] better communicator, you have to\n[02:02:02] understand the definition of true\n[02:02:04] connection. It's keeping it taught.\n[02:02:06] >> I am so shocked when I go to restaurants\n[02:02:09] with my girlfriend cuz we have a rule\n[02:02:10] and this is actually a rule that I\n[02:02:11] completely agreed with.\n[02:02:12] >> Yeah.\n[02:02:12] >> Which is like when we go on a date or we\n[02:02:14] go to a restaurant, there's no phones.\n[02:02:15] >> Exactly.\n[02:02:16] >> We're not going to be on our phones in a\n[02:02:17] restaurant.\n[02:02:17] >> It's mind-blowing.\n[02:02:18] >> Mindblowing. We went to um when we were\n[02:02:21] we've been here all this week and and we\n[02:02:24] went to a restaurant Sier and I and I\n[02:02:26] saw so many couples and people and\n[02:02:28] friends and that were just at the table\n[02:02:30] and it it was it was dark evening and\n[02:02:33] all you see is the glow of phones just\n[02:02:36] everybody just sitting there on their\n[02:02:37] phone. It's just it's it's crazy to me.\n[02:02:40] or or the people that are on their couch\n[02:02:43] with the TV on both of them are on their\n[02:02:46] phones and and they're supposed to be\n[02:02:48] watching a movie together.\n[02:02:49] >> You know, everyone people watches a\n[02:02:51] little bit and restaurants. Yeah. So,\n[02:02:53] I'm not going to pretend we don't.\n[02:02:54] >> Yeah. At least I'm not going to do that.\n[02:02:55] I'm\n[02:02:56] >> But we we will be in a restaurant and we\n[02:02:57] just sometimes play a little game where\n[02:02:59] we kind of guess how long people have\n[02:03:00] been together based on how they're\n[02:03:02] behaving.\n[02:03:02] >> Oh, I like that. Yeah, that's fun. And\n[02:03:03] so it's it tends to be the case that\n[02:03:05] it's the younger couples where there's a\n[02:03:08] man and a woman and they're both on\n[02:03:09] their phone and I just can't believe\n[02:03:12] what I'm seeing.\n[02:03:12] >> Yeah.\n[02:03:13] >> Like I'm look I got my phone a lot but\n[02:03:15] if I'm on a date I am not going to be\n[02:03:18] sat there looking at a screen while\n[02:03:19] she's sat there looking on a screen just\n[02:03:20] in total silence.\n[02:03:22] >> Even if I've known this woman for 35\n[02:03:24] years.\n[02:03:25] >> Yeah. It's become so much of a an\n[02:03:28] emotional pacifier when I don't like the\n[02:03:30] angst of having to wait in line by\n[02:03:32] myself. I don't like having to sit on\n[02:03:34] the the subway or the tube or the metro\n[02:03:37] or whatever by myself. I I get out I get\n[02:03:40] out my phone. I don't it it prevents me\n[02:03:42] from having to have dialogue. So\n[02:03:45] instead, I'd rather just look at my\n[02:03:46] phone and watch and scroll versus\n[02:03:49] communicating. Like there's imagine\n[02:03:52] waiting for your haircut and everybody\n[02:03:55] in the room is actually talking to one\n[02:03:57] another like they used to and it would\n[02:03:59] just be wild to you. Everybody in a\n[02:04:01] doctor's office in the waiting room\n[02:04:02] everybody's looking at their phone. So\n[02:04:06] yeah, to me it's such a distraction and\n[02:04:08] that means even at the house too I think\n[02:04:10] even more so when it comes to the house.\n[02:04:12] >> So that was point number two which was\n[02:04:13] reducing distraction and therefore\n[02:04:16] increasing presence. Three, stop over\n[02:04:20] explaining.\n[02:04:22] You have to invest in the right words.\n[02:04:25] Meaning, if you are constantly just\n[02:04:29] gushing words the whole time,\n[02:04:32] >> does it make you want to listen to that\n[02:04:34] person more or less?\n[02:04:36] >> Oh, yeah. I mean, you just kind of\n[02:04:38] discount it.\n[02:04:38] >> Yeah. Yeah. All of a sudden, it's it's\n[02:04:40] kind of like the that story about the\n[02:04:42] boy who cried wolf. like you you you\n[02:04:44] talk so much that the message gets lost.\n[02:04:47] If I'm always\n[02:04:49] talking a lot, it's easy to tune it out.\n[02:04:52] It's like it becomes its own static. But\n[02:04:55] if you choose your words, if I'm going\n[02:04:57] to slow down, so how do you how do you\n[02:04:59] stop yourself from overexlaining\n[02:05:02] instead of being a waterfall? Be a well.\n[02:05:05] Meaning rather than trying to gush out\n[02:05:07] information, get them swept away in your\n[02:05:10] message, you have a confidence in\n[02:05:13] holding your knowledge. If they have a\n[02:05:14] question, they'll ask. You're available\n[02:05:16] for the question should they want to\n[02:05:18] ask. But I'm going to give you always\n[02:05:20] exactly what you need if I choose to be\n[02:05:22] a well with my information rather than\n[02:05:24] just gushing. Because when I overexlain,\n[02:05:28] all somebody's doing is indicating that\n[02:05:30] I don't really know if I believe what\n[02:05:31] I'm saying or you believe what I'm\n[02:05:32] saying, so I need to say more. I notice\n[02:05:34] there's such power in when someone asks\n[02:05:36] you a question, taking a moment to\n[02:05:39] think. And actually sometimes I notice\n[02:05:41] some people will actually say, \"Let me\n[02:05:42] just think about that.\"\n[02:05:43] >> And the minute they do that, I'm I'm\n[02:05:46] immediately doing the opposite of\n[02:05:47] discounting what they say. I'm now\n[02:05:48] actually at baited breath to think about\n[02:05:51] to hear this very thoughtful, considered\n[02:05:53] thing they're about to share with me.\n[02:05:54] >> Right.\n[02:05:55] >> Whereas you see a lot of people do the\n[02:05:56] opposite. The minute they're asked\n[02:05:57] anything, it's just like the floodgates\n[02:05:59] open and they start filling the silence\n[02:06:00] with and they start thinking out loud.\n[02:06:02] >> Exactly. They're they're external\n[02:06:04] thinkers. What I teach is let your first\n[02:06:06] word be your breath. Meaning when you\n[02:06:11] put a breath where the first word should\n[02:06:13] be,\n[02:06:16] everything else flows. If I start\n[02:06:19] gushing, what I'm signaling is,\n[02:06:24] you know, I don't Most people wait until\n[02:06:26] they're talking to figure out what they\n[02:06:28] want to say.\n[02:06:28] >> Yeah. [sighs]\n[02:06:29] And so they say, \"Well, what I mean to\n[02:06:31] say is,\"Well, I say all that to say\n[02:06:33] because they're still trying to figure\n[02:06:34] it out.\" But if you were to ask me a\n[02:06:37] really hard question and rather than\n[02:06:39] having that knee-jerk reaction, I go,\n[02:06:41] \"That's a good question.\n[02:06:44] Let me think.\" Then you're going to be\n[02:06:47] you're going to be in it. You're going\n[02:06:48] to know whatever is about to come out\n[02:06:50] has actually been thought about, is\n[02:06:52] actually going to be something you want\n[02:06:54] to listen to. Now you're going to be\n[02:06:55] more curious. Now you wait with baited\n[02:06:58] breath of what's gonna happen. So when\n[02:07:00] you think of business meetings,\n[02:07:03] the person who goes, \"Oh, actually, you\n[02:07:05] know, I I disagree with that.\" If you\n[02:07:06] look at our latest studies and they just\n[02:07:07] start\n[02:07:09] versus when somebody asks, you know,\n[02:07:11] Stephen, what do you think? And you go\n[02:07:14] and you just hold that silence, it's\n[02:07:16] like a cliffhanger. Everybody wants to\n[02:07:18] hear what you said. People who are\n[02:07:21] confident, they don't have to say\n[02:07:25] something to show they know something.\n[02:07:28] They choose their moment. They choose\n[02:07:32] their timing.\n[02:07:34] >> It appears they're also the people that\n[02:07:35] are most likely to turn around and say,\n[02:07:36] \"I don't have the answer to that.\"\n[02:07:38] >> Yep. People who are truly confident\n[02:07:42] know they don't always have to get it\n[02:07:43] right. They know that they will get it\n[02:07:45] wrong. Confident people, Confidence does\n[02:07:48] not mean you have to know all the\n[02:07:49] answers. Confidence means you know that\n[02:07:51] you don't. When you have the confidence\n[02:07:53] of knowing I don't know everything,\n[02:07:56] all of a sudden you sound a lot more\n[02:07:57] real. There's also something about you\n[02:08:00] just being the type of person that's\n[02:08:01] willing to sit in silence but also just\n[02:08:03] take up more space and time that signals\n[02:08:05] respect. The very fact that you would\n[02:08:07] have the audacity to say someone asks me\n[02:08:09] a question and I go hm let me just think\n[02:08:12] about that for a second.\n[02:08:13] >> It it means that I'm not you talked\n[02:08:15] about rushing earlier. I don't rush. And\n[02:08:18] there's something about quite aura about\n[02:08:21] that. There we go.\n[02:08:22] >> About the fact that you you you're not\n[02:08:23] the type of per you're the type of\n[02:08:24] person that can just take seven seconds,\n[02:08:26] >> right?\n[02:08:26] >> Because you are it's you're you're kind\n[02:08:27] of stealing 7 seconds from everyone\n[02:08:31] there,\n[02:08:32] >> right?\n[02:08:32] >> So that you can think.\n[02:08:34] >> And you would think that the the harder\n[02:08:36] the issue, the more time that is\n[02:08:38] necessary.\n[02:08:39] >> You would think. Yeah.\n[02:08:39] >> And instead everybody's equated it to\n[02:08:41] immediate. it it think when let's say\n[02:08:45] we're on a a ship and it we're in the\n[02:08:48] middle of a storm. Who's the person that\n[02:08:50] they all look to to say, \"I'm freaking\n[02:08:53] out. I'm scared.\" But the captain isn't.\n[02:08:57] You know, they he this person knows. He\n[02:08:59] she knows. And we're constantly looking\n[02:09:01] for that person in times of emotional\n[02:09:04] stress. We're we're wanting someone to,\n[02:09:07] you know, I I'm too anxious, but I can\n[02:09:09] go to this person because in times of\n[02:09:11] crisis, they say, \"You walk, don't run.\"\n[02:09:14] You know, I I'm When I act like I've\n[02:09:17] been there before, and I've seen this,\n[02:09:20] I'm telling everybody else, \"Oh, oh, if\n[02:09:24] he's not worried, I shouldn't be\n[02:09:25] worried. If he's not upset, I don't have\n[02:09:27] to be upset.\" A lot of doctors, a lot of\n[02:09:30] professionals that deal with conflict\n[02:09:32] and crisis management, it's their job to\n[02:09:36] be as calm as could be because if they\n[02:09:39] reacted in a way that set you off or sit\n[02:09:42] you on edge, well then there's no\n[02:09:44] there's no anchor and then it's and then\n[02:09:46] it's a bad place to be. But yeah, just\n[02:09:48] having that let me think about that for\n[02:09:49] a second has a different tune of oh wow\n[02:09:53] this person\n[02:09:55] they know who they are. They I don't\n[02:09:57] rush. That's just not what I do.\n[02:09:59] >> It reminds me of every time I've had\n[02:10:01] turbulence on a plane and I've looked at\n[02:10:02] the flight attendant to see if this\n[02:10:03] thing is going down.\n[02:10:04] >> That's [laughter] so good. Yes, I've\n[02:10:06] done that. I I can't tell you how many\n[02:10:08] times I've done that where I'm looking\n[02:10:09] at the the hostess like just walking\n[02:10:12] still passing out snacks and not bother.\n[02:10:14] I'm like, \"Okay, if he's not bothered,\n[02:10:15] I'm\n[02:10:16] >> We do that in conversation every day.\n[02:10:18] We're we're looking for the calm flight\n[02:10:21] attendants. We're looking for the\n[02:10:22] anchors, the captains, the people who in\n[02:10:25] times of stress and turbulence in our\n[02:10:27] life, we can look to and say, \"If\n[02:10:29] they're okay and if they're good, then\n[02:10:31] I'm then I can be good.\" And when you\n[02:10:32] can be that person for others,\n[02:10:34] >> you're a leader.\n[02:10:34] >> Yeah. Always.\n[02:10:35] >> You are the leader.\n[02:10:36] >> Mhm.\n[02:10:37] >> This is probably the defining trait of I\n[02:10:39] think people that I have employed over\n[02:10:40] the years that I would consider a leader\n[02:10:42] or not a leader is how different they\n[02:10:45] are when [ __ ] has hit the fan.\n[02:10:47] >> Yes. And if there is seemingly no\n[02:10:49] difference in the way they're conducting\n[02:10:52] themselves, leader,\n[02:10:53] >> yep,\n[02:10:54] >> emotional regulator. They bring the\n[02:10:56] temperature down.\n[02:10:57] >> And then you have the inverse\n[02:10:59] >> where the minute any kind of sign of\n[02:11:01] trouble, there's stress, there's\n[02:11:03] >> there's overwhelm and it's contagious.\n[02:11:05] And what they need is the calm flight\n[02:11:07] attendant to regulate them,\n[02:11:09] >> right? So I think a and people I think\n[02:11:11] who want to be leaders in their\n[02:11:13] professional lives should really think\n[02:11:14] about this like how do you show up when\n[02:11:16] things are hard. I I always tell the\n[02:11:19] story of one of my friends called Oliver\n[02:11:20] who when I employed him must have been\n[02:11:22] seven eight years ago. Okay he wasn't my\n[02:11:24] friend when I hired him but the defining\n[02:11:26] trait of Oliver was that\n[02:11:30] he would deliver me good and bad news\n[02:11:36] uh the same\n[02:11:37] >> Yeah. with the same sort of nonchalant\n[02:11:41] calm\n[02:11:43] demeanor. So he'd walk up to me and say,\n[02:11:45] you know, we've just signed Uber Across\n[02:11:47] America. We're going to be there. And\n[02:11:49] then the days where everything was on\n[02:11:51] fire, he'd walk up to me, Stephen,\n[02:11:52] Clever Chat. I say, yeah, yeah, cool.\n[02:11:54] He'd say, just so you know, and then\n[02:11:55] he'd deliver some of the worst [ __ ] I've\n[02:11:57] ever heard in my entire life. But he'd\n[02:11:59] do it in such a calm way that I both I\n[02:12:02] was calm and I thought he had it under\n[02:12:05] control,\n[02:12:05] >> right? And I remember always thinking, I\n[02:12:07] need to put more people under this guy\n[02:12:09] >> because he's going to bring us down. And\n[02:12:11] so I just think as employers, I I\n[02:12:13] wouldn't have known that my boss or my\n[02:12:15] employer is thinking this unless someone\n[02:12:17] had said it to me. They're watching how\n[02:12:18] I deal with with things when she hears\n[02:12:21] the fan.\n[02:12:21] >> They're always watching. And I mean, I\n[02:12:23] mean, you take people that are are\n[02:12:25] watching you and your team. You have a\n[02:12:26] large team. When when you are um upset\n[02:12:30] and anxious, everybody feels it. It\n[02:12:33] [clears throat] spreads. But if you're\n[02:12:34] the one that's calm, it that spreads\n[02:12:37] too. And so it's\n[02:12:40] and and you have to get to the situation\n[02:12:42] where if you're upset, then people know\n[02:12:45] it's something to be upset about of if\n[02:12:49] you know I had um a friend in college.\n[02:12:52] He was upset about everything. I mean,\n[02:12:54] he just was a hotthead and he got upset\n[02:12:56] about the smallest things. How can you\n[02:12:58] possibly tell the difference between\n[02:12:59] what is a small thing and a big thing if\n[02:13:01] you're always having the same level of\n[02:13:04] reaction? But if you have a calmness and\n[02:13:08] let's say then you have an explosion\n[02:13:10] because it happens because you're human.\n[02:13:12] That's when people know this is\n[02:13:14] something serious.\n[02:13:15] >> Mhm.\n[02:13:16] >> Because if you always operate at a 10,\n[02:13:18] nobody's going to appreciate it when\n[02:13:19] it's really an 11. When you think about\n[02:13:21] like military generals and leaders, they\n[02:13:23] also have this other side to them, which\n[02:13:25] is they do also protect the standard.\n[02:13:28] And I think this there's a there's a\n[02:13:30] balance that's almost needed here\n[02:13:32] between being nonchalant in those\n[02:13:34] moments where something bad's happened,\n[02:13:35] we can't control it now, and then how\n[02:13:38] you defend the standard. So like you\n[02:13:39] watch the military barracks or whatever\n[02:13:41] when they're going through training,\n[02:13:42] these leaders are like screaming at them\n[02:13:44] about the standards, about the buttons,\n[02:13:45] about iron your shirt, make your boots\n[02:13:47] clean.\n[02:13:49] And so it appears on one end that they\n[02:13:52] are petty about something and they are\n[02:13:54] em you know they are these leaders are\n[02:13:55] emotional. You look at football\n[02:13:57] managers.\n[02:13:57] >> Yeah.\n[02:13:58] >> Or sporting managers.\n[02:13:59] >> Yeah.\n[02:14:00] >> They they almost exist in a bit of a\n[02:14:01] dichotomy which is like knowing when to\n[02:14:04] be controlled and then knowing when to\n[02:14:08] be emotionally seemingly emotionally\n[02:14:11] irrational about something.\n[02:14:12] >> Yeah. And I think those\n[02:14:15] those um specific situations are also\n[02:14:18] part of a system. You know, this is a\n[02:14:19] system that they've seen produce the\n[02:14:21] outcome that they want. So they know\n[02:14:23] that there's a utility to having that\n[02:14:25] big reaction or there's a purpose behind\n[02:14:28] it. What I find is the negative is when\n[02:14:31] you have people who there's not a\n[02:14:34] utility. They just they don't have the\n[02:14:37] words. the leaders who let's say curse a\n[02:14:40] lot because they don't really have the\n[02:14:42] vocabulary, you know, they they would\n[02:14:45] rather have big emotional reactions.\n[02:14:49] But the but when you have that type of\n[02:14:51] language that is not going to show that\n[02:14:53] you're in control of your emotions,\n[02:14:55] you're just less believable.\n[02:14:58] All I had to do was brain dump. Imagine\n[02:15:00] if you had someone with you at all times\n[02:15:02] that could take the ideas you have in\n[02:15:04] your head, synthesize them with AI to\n[02:15:07] make them sound better and more\n[02:15:08] grammatically correct and write them\n[02:15:10] down for you.

Yeah,\n[02:16:52] >> the second one was reducing um\n[02:16:53] distractions and the first was\n[02:16:54] authenticity. Number four, [snorts]\n[02:16:57] >> know how to deal\n[02:17:00] with their sadness.\n[02:17:05] A lot of people are hurting that you\n[02:17:08] don't know are hurting. And a lot of\n[02:17:10] people are grieving that you don't know\n[02:17:11] are grieving. Whether it's the holidays,\n[02:17:14] whether it's a\n[02:17:16] an important date or event that you\n[02:17:18] don't know about in their life and\n[02:17:20] they're hurting and grieving. If you\n[02:17:22] really want to be a top level\n[02:17:24] communicator, you need to know not to\n[02:17:26] say not only when the times are good,\n[02:17:28] but also when the times are are bad.\n[02:17:31] >> And how does how does one be there for\n[02:17:32] someone when they're going through their\n[02:17:33] moments of sadness? Is there any\n[02:17:35] principles that one should think about?\n[02:17:36] >> Yeah. But when somebody is grieving,\n[02:17:40] what you do not do\n[02:17:42] is begin with let me know if\n[02:17:47] if you if if what you are about to say\n[02:17:50] begins with let me know if it's the\n[02:17:53] wrong thing to say. Let me know if you\n[02:17:55] need anything. Let me know if I can do\n[02:17:57] anything for you. Hey, just just let me\n[02:17:59] know. Anything you need, let me know.\n[02:18:02] All you're doing is giving them a chore.\n[02:18:05] This person's already grieving at this\n[02:18:07] moment. They\n[02:18:09] It's They're going through something you\n[02:18:10] don't even know how to feel and you're\n[02:18:13] now giving them a chore of they're\n[02:18:15] supposed to be on their own to have the\n[02:18:19] ability to pull out their phone, text\n[02:18:23] their need to you.\n[02:18:26] That's never going to happen. Have Have\n[02:18:28] you ever had somebody who say, \"Let me\n[02:18:29] know if you need anything.\" actually let\n[02:18:31] you know that they needed something?\n[02:18:32] >> Never.\n[02:18:32] >> Never. Because you've now now you've\n[02:18:35] made it more comfortable on you and now\n[02:18:39] more of an obligation on them. And we\n[02:18:41] go, \"Well, you know what? I said all I\n[02:18:43] need to say. I let me know if you need\n[02:18:45] anything. Let me know how I can help.\"\n[02:18:47] Right? When all you've done is just\n[02:18:50] given them an obligation. You've you've\n[02:18:52] burdened it even more. Of course, they\n[02:18:54] don't want to burden you. They don't\n[02:18:54] want they don't even want to they don't\n[02:18:56] even want to live in some of these\n[02:18:57] moments. They they don't want to exist.\n[02:18:59] and they don't know how to do it. And\n[02:19:01] saying, \"Let me know if isn't going to\n[02:19:03] help them.\" Instead, here's what you do\n[02:19:05] when somebody's grieving. You do the\n[02:19:07] thing. Whatever you thought about doing,\n[02:19:10] go do it. If you wanted to bring them\n[02:19:12] dinner or said, \"Let me know if you need\n[02:19:14] any food,\" just go get them food. Go do\n[02:19:16] the task. Go run the errand. Go show up\n[02:19:19] and do their laundry. Go mow their yard\n[02:19:22] for them. Go do the thing. If I really\n[02:19:25] want you to be there for me and you\n[02:19:27] really want to be there for the other\n[02:19:28] person, you don't have to ask. You just\n[02:19:32] go do. And second of all, I find a lot\n[02:19:35] of time people who are with somebody\n[02:19:37] who's grieving, they don't know what to\n[02:19:38] say. They want to say something like I I\n[02:19:40] want to say something, but I don't I\n[02:19:41] don't really know what to say. I just I\n[02:19:42] feel uncomfortable. What I say is not\n[02:19:45] going to be enough. And so they just\n[02:19:46] stare at their phone and they kind of\n[02:19:47] text out a sentence and they delete it\n[02:19:48] because they don't really know what to\n[02:19:49] say. The best thing to say is just to\n[02:19:52] validate how you would assume it's going\n[02:19:54] to be feeling for them. Nobody deserves\n[02:19:57] what hap that this is totally unfair. I\n[02:20:01] can't believe that this happened. Nobody\n[02:20:03] deserves this. Be be able to express and\n[02:20:07] confirm that what they're feeling is\n[02:20:11] exactly what they should be feeling.\n[02:20:12] Don't go in with the, well, at least\n[02:20:15] they're in a better place. Hey, you know\n[02:20:17] what? Everything happens for a reason.\n[02:20:18] That's not the right time to say that if\n[02:20:20] ever to to be able to try and make them\n[02:20:24] feel better of oh you know I just at\n[02:20:26] least they're you know not is there\n[02:20:28] anything I can do any of that kind of\n[02:20:31] stuff it's like yeah I know you can do\n[02:20:32] you can bring that person back that's\n[02:20:34] what you can do that's not going to\n[02:20:35] happen you can't do that and so you\n[02:20:37] catch yourself in a corner where you\n[02:20:38] genuinely have an interest like how many\n[02:20:40] times people say you're in our thoughts\n[02:20:42] you're my thoughts and prayers thoughts\n[02:20:44] and prayers you know praying for you and\n[02:20:47] they haven't once sent up a prayer,\n[02:20:49] right? They're just saying it. If you\n[02:20:52] really mean it, text out the prayer to\n[02:20:54] them.\n[02:20:56] Text the prayer. Dear God, I'm I just\n[02:20:58] ask that you be with Stephen right now.\n[02:20:59] And what? Send the prayer to them. Why\n[02:21:03] Why not encourage them in that versus\n[02:21:05] just saying, hey, just keeping you in my\n[02:21:08] thoughts. If you are, then text them\n[02:21:11] thinking about you. No need to respond.\n[02:21:14] You think just putting it in a Facebook\n[02:21:16] comment is going to do enough? Just here\n[02:21:18] in our prayers. That's that's not\n[02:21:21] connection and that's not authentic.\n[02:21:22] That that's that's the easy shortcut.\n[02:21:25] >> I think I've spent my whole life\n[02:21:27] struggling with those moments where some\n[02:21:28] something bad has happened to someone or\n[02:21:30] they've been through something and\n[02:21:31] >> yeah,\n[02:21:32] >> you you found out over text message and\n[02:21:34] you don't know what to say.\n[02:21:35] >> You don't know what to say. You're like,\n[02:21:38] \"I'm so sorry.\" Um, and the amount of\n[02:21:42] times I've written something and then\n[02:21:43] deleted it and written something and\n[02:21:44] deleted it. And I [clears throat]\n[02:21:46] actually got some feedback from Samir,\n[02:21:48] um, who is a a very well-known YouTuber\n[02:21:51] creator, and he's he's part of a YouTube\n[02:21:53] channel called Colin and Samir. Their\n[02:21:56] their houses burnt down in the Palisades\n[02:21:57] fire.\n[02:21:58] And I'd say what, four, five, six months\n[02:22:01] later, he came up to me in New York and\n[02:22:02] said, um,\n[02:22:04] \"Thank you for the message you sent me\n[02:22:07] because it was specific.\"\n[02:22:10] And I know there's a cl we have a clip\n[02:22:12] of it cuz we were recording at the time.\n[02:22:13] We were I just come off stage and he was\n[02:22:15] at his at his event in New York and he'd\n[02:22:17] come up to me and said it. And it always\n[02:22:19] stayed with me that he remembered 6\n[02:22:20] months later. I didn't even really\n[02:22:21] remember the message I sent. He\n[02:22:23] remembered 6 months later that when his\n[02:22:25] house had\n[02:22:26] >> burnt down, they both just had I think\n[02:22:28] they both had like less than\n[02:22:29] one-year-old kids\n[02:22:31] >> and both of the houses had burnt down. I\n[02:22:34] sent him something specific I could help\n[02:22:35] him with.\n[02:22:36] >> I can't I can't remember the details of\n[02:22:38] what I said, but he came up and said,\n[02:22:40] \"Thank you for sending me something.\n[02:22:41] Lots of people sent me messages, but I\n[02:22:43] remember you sent me something\n[02:22:44] specific.\" That hits the theme of when\n[02:22:46] you stop trying to be\n[02:22:50] what's most convenient to you\n[02:22:53] and start doing what might be just a\n[02:22:55] slightly little bit more uncomfortable,\n[02:22:57] a little bit more work. The choice to do\n[02:23:00] something different and be more specific\n[02:23:02] in the thought to to not just say so\n[02:23:05] sorry to hear,\n[02:23:07] >> right? That's that's that's injustice to\n[02:23:10] be I mean that's that doesn't even touch\n[02:23:12] it. But if you were to say you were to\n[02:23:14] say\n[02:23:16] >> what is happening is totally unfair like\n[02:23:20] agree with it be specific with it. Same\n[02:23:23] thing with it's the same with\n[02:23:24] compliments. The more specific it is the\n[02:23:26] more genuine it is. The person that you\n[02:23:29] remember the longest is the person who's\n[02:23:31] able to be right there with you and say\n[02:23:34] exactly what you're feeling in that\n[02:23:36] moment\n[02:23:36] >> and make a genuine offer to to support a\n[02:23:39] real Yes. And also not as you said at\n[02:23:42] the start not an offer that they have to\n[02:23:44] accept\n[02:23:45] >> because no one accepts them.\n[02:23:47] >> Yeah. That or make it a condition that\n[02:23:50] they have to reach out to you in order\n[02:23:52] to you consider giving it\n[02:23:54] >> instead of just doing it or or even when\n[02:23:57] you feel that like I don't really know\n[02:24:00] what to to say but I'm you know what if\n[02:24:02] I were them this is what I'd want and go\n[02:24:06] do the thing. Otherwise, don't say it if\n[02:24:09] you don't mean it. I mean, that's just\n[02:24:11] the to me that's a sign of\n[02:24:15] you're you're not their person because\n[02:24:18] there's so many people that are just\n[02:24:20] fair weather friends that they they want\n[02:24:23] to be there and and be part of the\n[02:24:24] success, but when your face is on the\n[02:24:26] floor and you're at rock bottom, the\n[02:24:29] people you'll remember are the people\n[02:24:30] that show up.\n[02:24:32] >> Amen. I've heard that so many times from\n[02:24:34] my guests on this podcast where they\n[02:24:35] talk about their hardest moment\n[02:24:36] >> and it's always who who showed up in\n[02:24:38] that moment that\n[02:24:39] >> um number five. If you want to be a\n[02:24:42] better communicator, you have to know\n[02:24:44] how to handle the insults, the\n[02:24:47] backbiting, the dismissive, the\n[02:24:50] belittling, the patronizing, the words\n[02:24:53] that people use to try and inflict pain.\n[02:24:57] What do I do?\n[02:25:00] If you want to handle somebody who's\n[02:25:01] trying to hurt you with their words, the\n[02:25:04] first thing you have to do is have a\n[02:25:06] bunch of silence or it's five to seven\n[02:25:09] seconds of\n[02:25:12] nothing. Make it make it enough to where\n[02:25:14] it's uncomfortable where they they know\n[02:25:15] this is not going to be fun. Number two\n[02:25:18] is you ask them to repeat it. I need you\n[02:25:22] to say that again. I need you I I need\n[02:25:25] you to repeat that. Most of the time\n[02:25:27] people can't do it. And number three, if\n[02:25:30] I need to, I ask them, \"Did you mean did\n[02:25:33] you mean for that to sound\n[02:25:37] rude? Did you mean for that to sound\n[02:25:39] short? Did you mean for that to sound\n[02:25:40] upsetting?\" And what it does is allow\n[02:25:43] you to be able to\n[02:25:46] operate in a way that\n[02:25:50] doesn't allow their words to hurt you or\n[02:25:52] to touch you or that cut you.\n[02:25:56] Whenever somebody is saying something\n[02:25:57] that's to belittle you or insult you,\n[02:26:00] they're they're putting a big spotlight\n[02:26:02] on themselves and they're hoping to\n[02:26:03] throw it on to you to get your reaction.\n[02:26:05] So, they're going to I'm going to say\n[02:26:06] something hurtful to you and then it's\n[02:26:07] like they're turning the spotlight right\n[02:26:09] to you. And then when you ask a\n[02:26:12] question, when you have just silence, it\n[02:26:16] allows their words to kind of echo back\n[02:26:18] to them. And a lot of people will before\n[02:26:19] they even have to say anything, they'll\n[02:26:21] go, I I shouldn't have said that. When\n[02:26:23] the more silence you have, the more\n[02:26:24] awkward it becomes and they kind of have\n[02:26:26] to take it back. They realize you didn't\n[02:26:28] take the bait. But when you put the\n[02:26:30] spotlight and you ask the question, did\n[02:26:31] you do you mean for that to\n[02:26:34] embarrass me? Did you mean for that to\n[02:26:37] sound hurtful?\n[02:26:39] They can't bear the thought of saying\n[02:26:41] yes to that. So, they have to tweak it.\n[02:26:43] They have to fix it. They have to go,\n[02:26:45] \"Oh, no, no, no. I mean, what I mean,\n[02:26:47] what I meant to say was and they they go\n[02:26:50] a different way.\" Now, if they were to\n[02:26:52] double down and say, \"Yes, that's\n[02:26:53] exactly what I meant.\" You get to say,\n[02:26:55] \"Thank you for letting me know.\"\n[02:26:56] >> I was thinking about like the\n[02:26:57] neuroscience of what's going on there.\n[02:26:59] >> Yeah.\n[02:26:59] >> When you get someone to admit that\n[02:27:01] they're hurtful, um I remember\n[02:27:04] interviewing some neuroscientists who\n[02:27:06] talked about this idea of cognitive\n[02:27:07] dissonance, which is where like we all\n[02:27:09] have a perception of who we are.\n[02:27:11] >> Mh. And I guess by what you're doing\n[02:27:13] there, you're\n[02:27:16] creating the cognitive dissonance, which\n[02:27:18] is the cognitive mental discomfort by\n[02:27:21] making me kind of look in the mirror at\n[02:27:22] who I\n[02:27:24] who I just acted like. If I I don't\n[02:27:27] think I'm a hurtful person.\n[02:27:28] >> If I say something super hurtful and\n[02:27:30] then you ask me if I meant to be\n[02:27:32] hurtful, you're immediately like\n[02:27:33] speaking to my identity.\n[02:27:35] >> Yes.\n[02:27:35] >> And I don't want I'm not a hurtful\n[02:27:36] person,\n[02:27:37] >> right? And that's causing the the\n[02:27:38] dissonance which is the sort of the\n[02:27:40] disparity between who I think I am and\n[02:27:42] how I just behaved.\n[02:27:43] >> Yes.\n[02:27:43] >> And so I have to alleviate one of them.\n[02:27:45] I have to make sense.\n[02:27:46] >> Nobody believes they're on the side of\n[02:27:48] bad. They always think they're in the\n[02:27:49] side of good.\n[02:27:50] >> So you by you saying that to me, I\n[02:27:52] immediately have to confirm\n[02:27:53] >> right\n[02:27:54] >> that I am a person who is intent on\n[02:27:56] hurting others.\n[02:27:57] >> Yes.\n[02:27:58] >> That's not at all what I want to do. I\n[02:27:59] just wanted to gaslight you a little\n[02:28:00] bit. [laughter]\n[02:28:01] >> I just want to cause you pain. Yeah. And\n[02:28:03] so at that moment, it's what they're\n[02:28:06] thinking and feeling is I want you to\n[02:28:07] hurt like I'm hurting. I want you I want\n[02:28:09] to feel the control because I don't have\n[02:28:11] a sense of control now and I'm feeling a\n[02:28:13] certain way. I'm upset. So if I can make\n[02:28:15] you upset, well then I can have now I\n[02:28:17] can feel better and more justified about\n[02:28:19] how I'm feeling. And so some people\n[02:28:21] will, especially the manipulative ones,\n[02:28:24] they'll be upset, say something to make\n[02:28:26] you upset, and then turn around and go,\n[02:28:28] I don't know why you're so upset.\n[02:28:30] >> I'm I'm fine. I'm just fine. I don't\n[02:28:31] know why you're you're so upset. And\n[02:28:33] because they've just left you in it now.\n[02:28:34] Now they all they've done is just pass\n[02:28:36] it on to you. Like I don't like this\n[02:28:38] feeling, so now I'm going to give it to\n[02:28:40] you and I'm I'm totally good. What are\n[02:28:41] you talking about?\n[02:28:43] >> I had a situation in a gym a long time\n[02:28:45] ago where I was on a machine and a guy\n[02:28:47] he said that these all these machines\n[02:28:49] were his so he wanted to use them all.\n[02:28:51] And he just came up to me. This was a\n[02:28:53] long long time ago. And he was so like\n[02:28:57] out of pocket like he was you talked\n[02:28:59] about being in the pocket.\n[02:29:00] >> Mhm. super emotional within like 15\n[02:29:02] seconds this sort of slightly older\n[02:29:04] gentleman and basically like asked me if\n[02:29:06] I wanted to have a fight and it was so\n[02:29:09] bizarre to me that I felt like an\n[02:29:11] observer and I genuinely\n[02:29:12] >> Anybody else seen this?\n[02:29:13] >> No, it was him in the gym and I was so I\n[02:29:15] was I felt like David Atenburgh like I\n[02:29:17] was just like\n[02:29:18] >> and I did it and I inadvertently did\n[02:29:20] what you said which is my tone didn't\n[02:29:22] change at all. I spoke to him like this.\n[02:29:23] I'm like\n[02:29:24] >> did you just ask me for a fight in the\n[02:29:25] gym? [laughter] I was like, and then the\n[02:29:28] more cuz I asked genuinely like like\n[02:29:29] genuine curious questions and it\n[02:29:32] immediately disarmed him.\n[02:29:33] >> Yes.\n[02:29:33] >> But don't do that to strangers in the\n[02:29:35] gym. Oh my god, my [laughter] tone was\n[02:29:36] so low.\n[02:29:37] >> Yeah, but that's what it is. It's are\n[02:29:39] you okay?\n[02:29:40] >> You know, it's you're having to like\n[02:29:41] have to check on them for a second\n[02:29:43] because most of the time when you're\n[02:29:44] hearing them yell and and say ugly\n[02:29:47] things, what they're truly signaling is\n[02:29:49] I'm not okay.\n[02:29:50] >> It's there's always something else\n[02:29:52] that's going on. I've done it before\n[02:29:53] where somebody said something hurtful\n[02:29:55] and I said, \"How did you expect me to\n[02:29:58] respond to that?\" Or, \"How were you\n[02:30:00] wanting me to respond to that?\" Or, \"How\n[02:30:02] did you think I was going to respond?\"\n[02:30:04] And it's I've never had it where they\n[02:30:08] go, \"Well, I expected you to say an\n[02:30:09] insult.\" Like they it's always them\n[02:30:12] backpedaling and then trying to explain\n[02:30:14] how they're feeling in that moment\n[02:30:16] because they they don't know they don't\n[02:30:18] know how to to do it. But if I can stop,\n[02:30:21] put aside like you did your frustration\n[02:30:24] and say, \"Are you asking me for a fight\n[02:30:26] right now?\" [laughter] You know, are is\n[02:30:29] that what you're really asking for? That\n[02:30:30] kind of are you okay kind of thing?\n[02:30:33] That'll all of a sudden your frustration\n[02:30:34] now goes away.\n[02:30:36] >> You've changed the frame completely.\n[02:30:37] >> Absolutely.\n[02:30:38] >> Cuz the frame they wanted was\n[02:30:40] aggression. Maybe that's the the\n[02:30:41] language or the frame that they know as\n[02:30:43] the way to solve problems. But yours was\n[02:30:45] like in that scenario changed to\n[02:30:47] curiosity, which was like, \"What? How\n[02:30:48] did that\n[02:30:49] >> Yeah. Anytime you actually have a\n[02:30:52] mindset of instead of having something\n[02:30:56] well don't have something to prove have\n[02:30:59] something to learn. And so in that\n[02:31:00] moment you could have easily tried to\n[02:31:02] prove something of who who do you think\n[02:31:04] you're talking to? Do you know what I\n[02:31:06] you could have played that card instead\n[02:31:08] you actually got\n[02:31:09] >> curious of what's going on here? Are you\n[02:31:11] asking me for questions are powerful\n[02:31:14] that way. questions are disarming for\n[02:31:15] somebody who's trying to be aggressive\n[02:31:17] with you because they're not looking for\n[02:31:19] that type of mirror. They don't want a\n[02:31:22] mirror. They don't want to see the ugly\n[02:31:25] that they're putting out there. But\n[02:31:26] anytime somebody has that very\n[02:31:28] aggressive, I have so many people who\n[02:31:30] go, if somebody said this to me and was\n[02:31:33] so ugly and said this horrible thing\n[02:31:36] and they're looking for a quick\n[02:31:37] comeback, which I can give it to them,\n[02:31:39] but if they really care about the\n[02:31:41] relationship, I say, \"Okay, I assume\n[02:31:43] they said it at normal volume. What's\n[02:31:45] their need? Like, what are they what are\n[02:31:47] they really feeling?\"\n[02:31:48] >> Because if you just respond to the\n[02:31:50] reaction,\n[02:31:51] you're you're not going to hear the end\n[02:31:53] of it.\n[02:31:54] >> And we all have triggers.\n[02:31:55] >> Same. I I I definitely have mine. I\n[02:31:57] can't I can't I can't say anything. I'll\n[02:31:59] tell you one of the biggest things that\n[02:32:01] has helped me too in\n[02:32:05] um any any if anybody's wanting to\n[02:32:08] improve their personal relationships\n[02:32:10] with a partner or anything. It's one is\n[02:32:13] understanding validate first.\n[02:32:17] Frustration comes le next. If I respond\n[02:32:19] first with frustration, I'm going to\n[02:32:21] lose every time. So it's validating.\n[02:32:23] It's saying of course you'd feel this\n[02:32:24] way. It totally makes sense. I can see\n[02:32:26] how you feel that way. Acknowledging\n[02:32:27] that it's okay for them to feel that\n[02:32:29] way. Otherwise,\n[02:32:31] the partner is going to feel like I'm\n[02:32:32] being too much. And if I'm being too\n[02:32:34] much, then you're going to leave, right?\n[02:32:36] It's the it's the same sense of\n[02:32:37] abandonment. So, if I can hit that,\n[02:32:38] you're not being too much. I have the\n[02:32:40] capacity and the I can be elastic in\n[02:32:43] this relationship because I'm not going\n[02:32:46] to be my best self all the time, too.\n[02:32:47] But if I can give you a safe space for\n[02:32:49] you to be messy and me to be messy, then\n[02:32:51] you're actually going to have that\n[02:32:52] relationship. Number two, it's\n[02:32:54] understanding that\n[02:32:57] resets is your\n[02:33:00] uno wild card. Asking for a reset for if\n[02:33:04] I were to say, you know what, I didn't\n[02:33:05] say that right.\n[02:33:07] You know what? Can I can I try that\n[02:33:08] again? I didn't say that the best way,\n[02:33:11] did I? You know, I I could have done\n[02:33:13] that better. As soon as I start and ask\n[02:33:15] for a reset, I've never had anybody told\n[02:33:17] me no. Nobody goes, \"No, no, you have to\n[02:33:19] stick with it right now. Go ahead. Keep\n[02:33:20] failing.\" Like we in a video game, we\n[02:33:22] wouldn't Why would you keep playing if\n[02:33:24] you knew you're ultimately going to\n[02:33:25] lose? It's you restart. You try again.\n[02:33:27] And so giving yourself the grace and the\n[02:33:30] other person the grace to have the\n[02:33:31] ability to start over again is a\n[02:33:34] necessary part of communicating in\n[02:33:36] relationships. And three is slice it\n[02:33:38] thinner. A lot of the times if we're\n[02:33:42] having a big conversation,\n[02:33:44] we bring up somebody might bring up the\n[02:33:46] past that past thing and we just kind of\n[02:33:48] add it on and clummit on when we start\n[02:33:52] to kind of feel hopeless about it. But\n[02:33:53] if I can slice each issue by itself and\n[02:33:56] say, I do want to talk about this. I\n[02:33:59] want to address what's in front of us\n[02:34:00] first, that makes everything go a whole\n[02:34:03] lot better. But if I can slice each part\n[02:34:05] and see the need and validate that, I've\n[02:34:08] always seen that go better.\n[02:34:10] >> And on that first point about um how you\n[02:34:13] engage with your your partner during\n[02:34:16] conflict, one of the most useful things\n[02:34:18] I heard recently was a clip I actually\n[02:34:20] saw of Bnee Brown talking about when she\n[02:34:23] comes home after like a long day.\n[02:34:24] >> Yeah.\n[02:34:26] >> She will tell her partner how much she\n[02:34:28] has in the tank.\n[02:34:30] >> It's so good. And so she'll turn to her\n[02:34:31] partner and say, \"Listen, I've got 10%.\n[02:34:34] >> I can't do this today.\"\n[02:34:36] >> Right?\n[02:34:36] >> And I remember getting the clip and\n[02:34:38] sending it to my partner because it's\n[02:34:41] those that's some of the vocabulary that\n[02:34:42] probably would have really helped a lot\n[02:34:44] of my relationships, which is just first\n[02:34:46] expressing where I'm operating from.\n[02:34:48] >> So good.\n[02:34:50] >> And I don't think anybody is going to be\n[02:34:52] on the receiving end of honestly, I've\n[02:34:53] got like 10% in the tank today and go,\n[02:34:55] \"Nope, I want to do this now.\"\n[02:34:56] [laughter] Like\n[02:34:57] >> exactly. Well, using percentages in\n[02:34:59] conversation is incredibly helpful. Both\n[02:35:01] in relationships, like Bnee mentioned,\n[02:35:03] of saying, you know what, I got 10%, you\n[02:35:05] got 40%, let's put it together, and\n[02:35:07] we're going to make it work, but I at\n[02:35:08] least know where you're coming from.\n[02:35:10] Same thing at work, right? I've seen\n[02:35:12] what I encourage is when people are in a\n[02:35:15] meeting and they can put out an idea,\n[02:35:17] right? Rather than going, \"What if?\"\n[02:35:20] Because what happens is everybody just\n[02:35:21] starts to kill it, you know? They start\n[02:35:23] pointing arrows at it because it's\n[02:35:25] because it wasn't their idea. So, we\n[02:35:27] need to tank it down. But if they come\n[02:35:29] at it and say, \"Look, I got 30% of an\n[02:35:32] idea,\" then what happens magically is\n[02:35:35] that everybody else wants to join in.\n[02:35:37] So, if I were to say, \"Look, I Steve, I\n[02:35:39] got 20% of an idea. I need your help\n[02:35:42] with the other 80.\" All of a sudden, you\n[02:35:43] take it as a, \"Oh, me? I can I can do\n[02:35:46] that.\" And then everybody else starts to\n[02:35:48] build it up rather than trying to tear\n[02:35:50] it down. Or even if in conversation, if\n[02:35:52] I say, \"Look,\n[02:35:54] I know I'm not going to have the right\n[02:35:55] words. I'm going to have about 60% of\n[02:35:58] it. Like that. At least is me confirming\n[02:36:00] that I know what I'm saying is not going\n[02:36:02] to always be the right thing to say.\n[02:36:04] >> I wish I did that more. This is um I\n[02:36:06] believe this is the clip I'm talking\n[02:36:07] about. It was Tim Ferris.\n[02:36:08] >> Everyone says marriage should be 50/50.\n[02:36:10] It's the biggest crack of [ __ ] I've\n[02:36:12] ever heard. It's never 50/50.\n[02:36:13] >> Yeah.\n[02:36:14] >> Ever. And so what we do is we quantify\n[02:36:17] where we are. So if Steve comes home and\n[02:36:19] he'll be like, I got 20. Just in terms\n[02:36:21] of energy,\n[02:36:22] >> just energy, investment, kindness,\n[02:36:25] patience, I'm at a 20 and I'll be like,\n[02:36:28] I'll cover you. I got you, brother.\n[02:36:30] Like, I'll pull the 80. Sometimes we\n[02:36:32] come home, which we have done a lot. My\n[02:36:34] mom has been sick. And I'll say, I've\n[02:36:37] got 10. And Steo, like two days ago\n[02:36:39] said, I'm riding a solid 25. So, we know\n[02:36:43] that we have to sit down at the table\n[02:36:45] anytime we have less than 100 combined\n[02:36:47] and figure out a plan of kindness toward\n[02:36:49] each other.\n[02:36:49] >> Oh, I love that. Yeah, because the thing\n[02:36:51] is marriage is not something that's\n[02:36:53] 50/50. A partnership works when you can\n[02:36:56] carry their 20 or they can carry your\n[02:36:58] 20. And that when you both just have 20,\n[02:37:02] you have a plan where you don't hurt\n[02:37:03] each other.\n[02:37:04] >> So good.\n[02:37:05] >> That's the mistake I've made multiple\n[02:37:06] times.\n[02:37:06] >> Oh. I try and solve big problems with\n[02:37:08] 10.\n[02:37:09] >> That's the mistake we make every day.\n[02:37:10] >> Yeah. I mean, for me and with Sierra and\n[02:37:12] I, it's usually if we're in a part of an\n[02:37:14] argument, typically our arguments end\n[02:37:16] pretty quickly, but the ones that go\n[02:37:18] long,\n[02:37:20] it's sometimes, you know, I just don't\n[02:37:22] feel like it. You know, I I could give\n[02:37:24] an apology, you could give an apology,\n[02:37:25] and some I just don't feel I don't feel\n[02:37:26] like being sorry right now. I will\n[02:37:28] later, but I in the moment, I'm just\n[02:37:31] >> I I I I just got this stuff in me and\n[02:37:33] I'm not ready yet. And so what happens\n[02:37:36] for me and what's been so helpful is\n[02:37:38] when I'm aggravated at that edge and I\n[02:37:40] don't want to give a thing is to say\n[02:37:44] my battery's in the red like we say in\n[02:37:45] the red because of\n[02:37:47] >> you know iPhone it's like I'm once I\n[02:37:49] know I'm in that place we know to time\n[02:37:51] out because it's or else you'd be two\n[02:37:53] hours in and you're still now you've\n[02:37:55] just said way worse things you know that\n[02:37:58] you're going to apologize for and so\n[02:37:59] often when the quicker you can get to a\n[02:38:02] timeout like if you want to know how\n[02:38:04] well a a relationship communicates. Look\n[02:38:07] how often they take timeouts because\n[02:38:09] timeouts are I mean they're\n[02:38:14] the the amount of value you get in just\n[02:38:17] a pause and then even five minutes\n[02:38:20] coming back to it. you have a different\n[02:38:22] like okay here we go like a fresh fresh\n[02:38:24] start like why would you leave somebody\n[02:38:27] on the field for three hours and never\n[02:38:30] give them a rest and you think I can't I\n[02:38:34] we do it physically but I'm not going to\n[02:38:35] do it mentally like if you if you want\n[02:38:38] to know\n[02:38:41] the key to the relationship\n[02:38:44] the metric that is the most valuable key\n[02:38:48] to a relationship is that the measure\n[02:38:52] The quality of the conversation\n[02:38:54] is equal to the quality of the\n[02:38:56] relationship. Said differently, the\n[02:38:59] quality of the relationship is equal to\n[02:39:01] the quality of the communication. You\n[02:39:04] look at all these couples that are\n[02:39:06] divorcing,\n[02:39:08] okay? Or the couples that are in bad\n[02:39:12] states.\n[02:39:14] It's because they were okay in the\n[02:39:16] positive, but they don't know how to\n[02:39:18] deal deal with the negative. So, it's\n[02:39:21] it's the measure of not just can we talk\n[02:39:23] about the happy stuff, the if you talk I\n[02:39:26] I talk to these elderly couples that\n[02:39:28] have been married for 50 years and I\n[02:39:30] say, \"What's what's your secret?\" It's\n[02:39:32] it's not can you be happy in the happy.\n[02:39:34] It's can you how long can you sit with\n[02:39:37] the hard and how how long can you be in\n[02:39:39] the in the sad times because those are\n[02:39:42] going to happen. And I see that so many\n[02:39:44] with the people. There's so many people\n[02:39:46] who communicate with me or message or\n[02:39:49] and they're going through a divorce or\n[02:39:50] they have been divorced and you realize\n[02:39:53] that it's it's not often that they fell\n[02:39:56] out of love. They fell out of\n[02:39:58] communication. They they stopped talking\n[02:40:01] to each other.\n[02:40:03] This is I think one of the great myths\n[02:40:04] we're sold when we get into our first\n[02:40:06] relationship is we think that the sign\n[02:40:08] of a good relationship is the lack of\n[02:40:10] conflict. But if you've ever been in a\n[02:40:12] long relationship, I think over time you\n[02:40:14] start to figure that it's not the amount\n[02:40:16] of conflict. It's like it's it's how one\n[02:40:19] manages the conflict. I read a quote\n[02:40:21] which I've never forgotten which said\n[02:40:23] you can predict the long-term health of\n[02:40:24] a relationship by whether each cut heals\n[02:40:26] to 101% or 99%.\n[02:40:29] >> I.e. does your conflict make you\n[02:40:31] stronger?\n[02:40:31] >> Yeah. And if I look back through the\n[02:40:33] conflict that I've had with like my\n[02:40:34] partner that I've been with a long time\n[02:40:35] now, I go it has actually\n[02:40:39] deepened the roots.\n[02:40:41] >> Yeah, it has to\n[02:40:42] >> like it's been productive conflict.\n[02:40:44] >> Mhm.\n[02:40:44] >> You know, which has made us stronger. Um\n[02:40:47] and that and that in part is because of\n[02:40:49] many of the things that you talk about\n[02:40:51] which is like trying not to win every\n[02:40:53] argument,\n[02:40:54] >> right?\n[02:40:55] >> And all the things in your book. It's\n[02:40:56] >> Yeah. Well, that's Sierra. That's what\n[02:40:59] Sierra talks about. Either way, it's\n[02:41:00] good. Like it's the conflict. You want\n[02:41:02] conflict in your relationship for the\n[02:41:05] growth. It is rare that you can have\n[02:41:07] individual growth alone.\n[02:41:09] >> It has to be relational\n[02:41:11] >> 100%.\n[02:41:11] >> It has to be with other people. I I I\n[02:41:13] can read a book on how to do something,\n[02:41:15] but until I do it,\n[02:41:18] >> it's it's a totally different game. So I\n[02:41:20] I I\n[02:41:21] learn relationally with things and with\n[02:41:24] other people and places, but for sure\n[02:41:26] relationship, I mean, there's just no\n[02:41:28] there's no other way to go around it.\n[02:41:30] you have to have the conflict if you\n[02:41:32] want to be if you want to be better. And\n[02:41:34] I I've seen so many times where the\n[02:41:36] people um they\n[02:41:40] face in their hands, they don't know how\n[02:41:41] to talk to one another because they gave\n[02:41:45] up on trying to repair, but they're\n[02:41:48] they're all in on trying to blame. Mhm.\n[02:41:50] >> And so when you are trying to\n[02:41:53] kind of undo what has to be done that\n[02:41:56] makes it all the more difficult because\n[02:41:57] it's just so many years where there\n[02:41:59] could have been repair but there there\n[02:42:02] hasn't been and in turn that really\n[02:42:04] hurts the relationship. I read a recent\n[02:42:06] study that the biggest predictor of the\n[02:42:11] child's well-being within the parental\n[02:42:13] relationship\n[02:42:15] is not whether they were married or\n[02:42:16] divorced. It was how they dealt with\n[02:42:19] conflict.\n[02:42:21] >> I mean, because how many people have had\n[02:42:22] parents that are still together but\n[02:42:24] fight terribly?\n[02:42:25] >> Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah.\n[02:42:26] >> And in in fact should probably maybe not\n[02:42:28] be together.\n[02:42:29] >> Yeah.\n[02:42:30] >> Or those that they're divorced but\n[02:42:33] communicate. Great.\n[02:42:35] >> Yeah.\n[02:42:35] >> And they never put their child in the\n[02:42:37] middle of it and didn't use the child as\n[02:42:39] a a male carrier between the two. to to\n[02:42:42] be able to do that is I mean you're you\n[02:42:45] get to change the whole trajectory of of\n[02:42:47] a child's life\n[02:42:48] >> at some point. We have to forgive our\n[02:42:49] parents, right?\n[02:42:50] >> Yeah, that's that's the truth.\n[02:42:52] >> Like you said, like they were they were\n[02:42:54] kids too, raised by parents that\n[02:42:57] >> this is their first time still doing it.\n[02:42:58] You know, [laughter]\n[02:43:01] >> you have a workbook on its way in March\n[02:43:02] 10th called the next conversation\n[02:43:05] workbook.\n[02:43:05] >> Yeah. practical exercises for arguing\n[02:43:08] less and talking more, which really\n[02:43:09] takes everything that you wrote about\n[02:43:10] and turns it into an actionable\n[02:43:12] blueprint framework for people that\n[02:43:14] really want to embed these habits into\n[02:43:16] their lives. Um, I'm going to link that\n[02:43:19] below. Is that available for pre-order?\n[02:43:20] Will it be? Yeah, there'll be a\n[02:43:21] pre-order link. So, we'll put that in\n[02:43:22] the description below. You're also\n[02:43:23] working on some AI stuff, which I think\n[02:43:24] was interesting.\n[02:43:25] >> Yeah. Thank you. So, I'm about to\n[02:43:27] release an AI of just my content. So it\n[02:43:31] has my book, it has my podcasts, it has\n[02:43:33] my you any of my social clips of it has\n[02:43:36] it all. And so it's a small language\n[02:43:38] model to where it's everybody can have\n[02:43:41] their own personal communication expert,\n[02:43:43] you know, 247 kind of thing. It's what\n[02:43:45] they have on it, but where people get to\n[02:43:48] practice. So what I love about it the\n[02:43:50] most is let's say you you say I'm about\n[02:43:53] to go into a important meeting and I\n[02:43:55] want to sound really confident. What can\n[02:43:56] I do? or I'm about to have a my spouse\n[02:44:00] isn't listening or really upset. What\n[02:44:02] could I do? You apply those right in\n[02:44:05] that that moment and gives you a\n[02:44:07] different way of perspecting a different\n[02:44:09] way of seeing things from a different\n[02:44:11] view or what I definitely what I've uh\n[02:44:15] like is to tell it to be a boss. Be my\n[02:44:19] boss who's really mean and arrogant and\n[02:44:21] let's do an exercise of how to respond\n[02:44:23] to this situation. and you test is that\n[02:44:27] response going to be the best response\n[02:44:29] and allow it to kind of have a a\n[02:44:32] different way of practicing things that\n[02:44:34] maybe you need to be ready for cuz some\n[02:44:35] people need to be ready for the hard\n[02:44:36] response.\n[02:44:37] >> I'll link that below too.\n[02:44:39] >> Yeah.\n[02:44:39] >> So people can have a play with that and\n[02:44:41] sign up.\n[02:44:41] >> I'm excited.\n[02:44:42] >> We have a closing tradition where the\n[02:44:43] last guest leaves a question for the\n[02:44:44] next question left for you is who are\n[02:44:47] you most dying to meet and why?\n[02:44:50] >> Oh, that's a great one.\n[02:44:53] um\n[02:44:55] person I would love to meet right now\n[02:45:00] is probably Bnee Brown. That's probably\n[02:45:02] it. Really, the fact that you brought\n[02:45:04] her up. The reason why is because\n[02:45:07] >> I know that she's been in the space a\n[02:45:09] long time. And I feel that when she\n[02:45:12] shares stuff, it's very genuine. Like\n[02:45:15] there's no guessing that she's real.\n[02:45:18] >> Yeah. She's about as real and raw as\n[02:45:20] authentic as you can get. She's also a\n[02:45:23] Longhorn Texas Longhorn fan which I'm a\n[02:45:25] fan, but I feel like when and this is\n[02:45:28] just me personally, I kind of got pushed\n[02:45:30] into this field\n[02:45:33] and you you always look for people that\n[02:45:36] are your own anchors in life of who\n[02:45:38] you'd want to be a mentor kind of thing.\n[02:45:40] And that's somebody who's I feel like\n[02:45:43] has\n[02:45:44] been in the the world and and knows some\n[02:45:47] things and has just some incredible\n[02:45:48] knowledge that's helped a lot of people.\n[02:45:52] >> She's most certainly authentic. She's\n[02:45:54] incredible.\n[02:45:55] >> Yeah.\n[02:45:55] >> Well, I listen, if people haven't bought\n[02:45:57] your book, which is almost nobody, but\n[02:45:59] if there are still some people out there\n[02:46:00] that have haven't bought this book, I\n[02:46:02] highly recommend it. I think I um\n[02:46:03] included it in my Smith collection as\n[02:46:05] well in the UK. You did such a smash hit\n[02:46:09] success. It's a success on two\n[02:46:11] dimensions. It's sales and it's impact.\n[02:46:13] >> Thank you.\n[02:46:14] >> And um it's also incredibly accessible.\n[02:46:16] So it's not like a a complicated science\n[02:46:18] book and it's written for normal people\n[02:46:20] that are going through very real\n[02:46:21] relatable normal problems. And um I\n[02:46:24] think that's why it's been so\n[02:46:25] successful. I think you you approach\n[02:46:26] these challenges from a very real place.\n[02:46:29] And maybe that's in part why it's been\n[02:46:32] so wonderfully received and so relatable\n[02:46:34] is because, you know, you're a trial\n[02:46:37] attorney that's bringing this stuff to\n[02:46:39] the masses, but you're not like a PhD\n[02:46:42] scholar who might have draw thrown up\n[02:46:44] the drawbridge because they they they've\n[02:46:45] spent all their life in academia.\n[02:46:47] >> And I think the way that you communicate\n[02:46:49] is so relatable and resonant that it's\n[02:46:51] no wonder that you're you've been on an\n[02:46:53] absolute unbelievable terror over the\n[02:46:55] last couple years.\n[02:46:56] >> It's phenomenal. Like crazy crazy\n[02:46:58] incredible. So congratulations and thank\n[02:47:00] you from all the people that you've\n[02:47:01] given thanks man\n[02:47:02] >> a little bit of light to a little bit of\n[02:47:04] um\n[02:47:05] >> you've empowered them with information\n[02:47:07] so that they can live the life that they\n[02:47:08] um they deserve to live. That's a\n[02:47:09] special thing Jefferson.\n[02:47:10] >> I appreciate it. Thank you Ste. [music]\n[02:47:15] >> If there's anything we need it is\n[02:47:17] connection especially in the world we're\n[02:47:19] living in today. And that is exactly why\n[02:47:21] we created these conversation cards.\n[02:47:23] Because on this show, when I sit here\n[02:47:25] with my guests and have those deep,\n[02:47:27] intimate conversations, this remarkable\n[02:47:29] thing happens time and time again. We\n[02:47:31] feel deeply connected to each other. At\n[02:47:34] the end of every episode, the guest I'm\n[02:47:35] interviewing leaves a question for the\n[02:47:37] next guest, and we've turned them into\n[02:47:39] these conversation cards. And we've\n[02:47:41] added these twist cards to make your\n[02:47:43] conversations even more interesting. And\n[02:47:45] there are so many more twists along the\n[02:47:47] way with the conversation cards. This is\n[02:47:48] the brand new edition. And for the first\n[02:47:50] time ever, I've added to the pack this\n[02:47:52] gold card, which is an exclusive\n[02:47:54] question from me. But I'm only putting\n[02:47:57] the gold cards in the first run of\n[02:48:00] conversation cards. So get yours now\n[02:48:02] before the limited edition gold cards\n[02:48:03] are all gone. Head to the link in the\n[02:48:05] description below. [music]\n[02:48:13] [music]\n[02:48:22] >> [singing]\n[02:48:24] [music]",
