  "transcript": "[00:00] Here's the problem with magnesium\n[00:01] supplementation when it comes to sleep.\n[00:03] The first thing to note is that most\n[00:04] forms of magnesium don't cross the brain\n[00:07] barrier and sleep is produced by your\n[00:09] brain. So, how can something that\n[00:11] doesn't get into your brain affect brain\n[00:13] process? All you're doing is creating\n[00:15] probably expensive urine.\n[00:18] However, there is one form of magnesium\n[00:20] that seems to have some evidence in\n[00:22] favor of it which we can speak about.\n[00:24] But it doesn't stop there. There's so\n[00:26] much new evidence that we have including\n[00:28] this myth of 8 hours. my fear about\n[00:30] giving melatonin to kids. Why you keep\n[00:32] waking up in the middle of the night and\n[00:34] the invention of the first new class of\n[00:37] sleeping medication that I actually\n[00:38] favor and most people are not aware of\n[00:40] it.\n[00:41] >> Okay, let me write this down.\n[00:42] >> Matthew Walker is back and the\n[00:44] worldrenowned sleep expert and\n[00:46] neuroscience professor\n[00:47] >> is sharing brand new research to combat\n[00:49] the sleep loss epidemic and help you get\n[00:51] the perfect night's sleep. So society,\n[00:54] we have struggles with sleep at night\n[00:55] due to many reasons, but no one teaches\n[00:58] us this stuff. And it's things like say\n[01:00] you go to bed at 11:00 one night, 1:00\n[01:02] a.m. the next night, then 10:30 p.m. the\n[01:05] next night. And it's remarkable how many\n[01:06] people do this, but studies have shown\n[01:08] that you are statistically 49% more\n[01:11] likely to prematurely die versus those\n[01:13] people who were most regular in terms of\n[01:15] going to bed and waking up at the same\n[01:17] time. And worse, they had a 57%\n[01:20] cardioabolic disease risk increase.\n[01:23] >> What the\n[01:23] >> science really teaches us that there are\n[01:25] four pillars of good sleep. And then\n[01:26] there's this incredible new study\n[01:28] looking at sleep banking. And this is\n[01:30] remarkable for people who are facing a\n[01:32] sprint at work or a medical doctor about\n[01:33] to go on call for the next 40 hours, new\n[01:35] parent. And we can go through all of\n[01:37] that. But if you were to push me to say\n[01:39] the three most impactful things that you\n[01:41] can start doing tonight to start\n[01:43] sleeping better, it would be\n[01:49] I see messages all the time in the\n[01:50] comments section that some of you didn't\n[01:52] realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you\n[01:54] could do me a favor and double check if\n[01:55] you're a subscriber to this channel,\n[01:57] that would be tremendously appreciated.\n[01:58] It's the simple, it's the free thing\n[02:00] that anybody that watches this show\n[02:01] frequently can do to help us here to\n[02:03] keep everything going in this show in\n[02:05] the trajectory it's on. So, please do\n[02:07] double check if you've subscribed and uh\n[02:09] thank you so much because in a strange\n[02:10] way, you are you're part of our history\n[02:12] and you're on this journey with us and I\n[02:14] appreciate you for that. So yeah, thank\n[02:16] you\n[02:20] Dr. Matthew Walker. Here in front of me,\n[02:22] I have these cards which I'm going to\n[02:25] reveal a bit later, but these kind of\n[02:27] hold what you consider to be the four\n[02:28] pillars of great sleep. But you also\n[02:32] spend much of your professional career\n[02:34] just studying the brain generally to\n[02:36] understand human performance and how we\n[02:38] can change our lifestyles and also\n[02:40] introduce some of these new sort of\n[02:42] treatments to improve how our brain\n[02:44] performs. And I want to talk about all\n[02:45] of that as well, but to start for anyone\n[02:47] that is unfamiliar with you and has been\n[02:49] hiding under a rock,\n[02:51] how do you summarize who you are\n[02:54] professionally,\n[02:55] the sort of academic references you're\n[02:57] drawing on, and the experiences and\n[03:00] research you've done so that the viewer\n[03:01] listening at home understands the full\n[03:04] world that you operate in, study, and\n[03:06] have experienced.\n[03:08] >> I am a neuroscientist by trade, but my\n[03:11] specialty is sleep. the effects of sleep\n[03:13] on the brain and the body. And I've\n[03:15] probably spent about the past two\n[03:16] decades trying to understand exactly why\n[03:20] do we sleep? Because 50 years ago, the\n[03:24] crass answer to the question, why do you\n[03:26] sleep was the following? You sleep to\n[03:29] cure sleepiness,\n[03:32] which is the factous equivalent of\n[03:33] saying, well, you eat to cure hunger.\n[03:35] No, you don't eat to cure cure hunger.\n[03:38] you eat to support all sorts of\n[03:40] physiological and biological benefits.\n[03:42] But now, and this is not due to my\n[03:44] research, is this all of the incredible\n[03:46] colleagues whose sort of shoulders that\n[03:48] I stand on, we've now had to upend the\n[03:50] question. We now have to ask, is there\n[03:53] any major physiological system in your\n[03:55] body or is there any operation of your\n[03:57] mind that isn't wonderfully enhanced by\n[04:00] sleep when you get it or demonstrabably\n[04:02] impaired when you don't get enough? And\n[04:04] the answer now seems to be no. There is\n[04:07] no such system. Even down to the level\n[04:10] of your DNA,\n[04:12] your sleep and how you are sleeping or\n[04:15] not sleeping will change the very DNA\n[04:19] nucleic alphabet that spells out your\n[04:22] daily health narrative. And we can see\n[04:24] it all the way up to society. Sleep can\n[04:27] change the fabric of society, can change\n[04:29] how we interact with other people. It\n[04:31] can change our belief systems. can\n[04:34] change how lonely or sort of hypersocial\n[04:37] we are. So to your question, I'm a sleep\n[04:40] scientist by trade and I suppose my\n[04:42] mission has been trying to reunite\n[04:45] humanity with the sleep that it seems to\n[04:46] be so bereft of.\n[04:48] >> We had a fantastic conversation last\n[04:50] time and my audience valued it\n[04:52] tremendously. I know that cuz we we\n[04:54] often survey our audience and we we get\n[04:55] to see some of the the backend stats and\n[04:58] this conversation about sleep is\n[04:59] particularly personal to everybody\n[05:00] listening because when we surveyed our\n[05:02] audience ahead of this conversation\n[05:03] today about 75 or 80% of the direio\n[05:08] audience struggle with sleep for a\n[05:10] variety of different reasons. So we\n[05:12] actually asked them a thousand of them\n[05:13] their questions to ask you today. But\n[05:16] also the other reason I really wanted to\n[05:17] chat to you is the science of sleep I\n[05:19] mean as is the way of science is always\n[05:21] evolving. We're learning new things and\n[05:22] even since we spoke last time, there is\n[05:25] new sleep science which we're going to\n[05:26] talk about today and one of those\n[05:28] particular things we're going to talk\n[05:29] about is going to be demonstrated using\n[05:32] this jar because I always want to know\n[05:34] what the updated sleep science is so\n[05:35] that I can be a better sleeper because I\n[05:37] agree with everything you've said about\n[05:39] how foundational sleep is in my life.\n[05:44] >> And um I didn't know this at the start\n[05:46] of my career. I didn't know this even a\n[05:48] couple of years ago, five years ago. I\n[05:49] didn't know. I thought sleep was one of\n[05:51] those things you could just take it all\n[05:53] or leave.\n[05:54] >> Yeah. I mean, and it's not your fault in\n[05:56] so many ways because if you didn't know\n[05:59] what I know, you would just think, well,\n[06:01] when I sleep, my body is dormant and my\n[06:04] mind for the most part is blank. So, is\n[06:07] it so catastrophic to lose, you know, an\n[06:10] hour or two of sleep? And you know, you\n[06:13] have to then think about from an\n[06:15] evolutionary perspective, it is such an\n[06:18] idiotic idea to sleep because when\n[06:21] you're sleeping, you're not finding a\n[06:22] mate, you're not reproducing, you're not\n[06:24] caring for your young, you're not\n[06:25] foraging for food, and worst of all,\n[06:27] you're vulnerable to predation.\n[06:29] >> So on any one of those grounds, and\n[06:31] especially all of them as a collective,\n[06:33] sleep should have been strongly selected\n[06:34] against in the course of evolution.\n[06:38] And my point is that, and it's often\n[06:40] been said that if sleep doesn't serve an\n[06:41] absolutely vital set of functions\n[06:43] plural, then it's the biggest mistake\n[06:45] the evolutionary process has ever made.\n[06:47] And we now realize it didn't make a\n[06:48] spectacular blunder. But really, I guess\n[06:51] to the point of it is sleep is not a\n[06:55] passive state. It's an incredibly active\n[06:58] state both in the terms of the brain and\n[07:00] the body. And so you should not feel\n[07:03] sort of you know remiss or ashamed that\n[07:06] you didn't value the importance of sleep\n[07:08] because firstly as a subjective sense\n[07:10] you just think well my mind was offline\n[07:12] for a while. Second we also know that we\n[07:15] don't teach the importance of sleep in\n[07:17] education and doctors themselves you\n[07:19] know there's a great study and they what\n[07:21] they found was that medical doctors\n[07:23] across I think it was about 11 different\n[07:25] curricula around the world they will\n[07:27] only receive about 1.2 two hours of\n[07:30] education on sleep, but it's a third of\n[07:33] their patients lives. So there's a\n[07:37] collection of sort of almost perfect\n[07:39] storms that have happened to keep\n[07:42] society ignorant of the importance and\n[07:45] the value of sleep. I think that's why\n[07:48] we often so short change it together\n[07:51] with also something terrible which is\n[07:53] stigma.\n[07:55] that people are so proud to say, well,\n[07:58] I've been eating really healthy the past\n[08:00] couple of months, or, you know, I've\n[08:01] been going to the gym, you know, three\n[08:03] times a week consistently for the past\n[08:05] year. No one is ever going out into\n[08:09] society and saying, you know, I I've\n[08:11] been getting 8 and 1/2 hours of sleep\n[08:13] consistently every night. Because if you\n[08:15] did, people would say, really? And\n[08:17] there's a there's a slight edge to the\n[08:20] really which is that if you have time to\n[08:23] sleep then you must not be busy and if\n[08:26] you're not busy you must not be\n[08:28] important.\n[08:30] So can you do me a favor and for the\n[08:32] listener at home can you tell me what\n[08:35] the different groups of people that are\n[08:38] listening to this conversation right now\n[08:40] are seeking from the extreme end being\n[08:43] sleep apnnea. I get no sleep. I'm an\n[08:45] insomniac to the other end where maybe\n[08:47] they're looking for marginal performance\n[08:49] gains. Like what are the what are the\n[08:50] cohorts of people you see and the\n[08:52] reasons why they're so interested in\n[08:53] your work? They listen to your podcast,\n[08:54] they read your books. What are the\n[08:56] cohorts?\n[08:56] >> Firstly, we have the collection of\n[08:58] people who have insomnia. Those people\n[09:00] who have other sleep disorders like\n[09:02] sleep apnoa which we can speak about.\n[09:04] There's another disorder called restless\n[09:06] leg syndrome. It's a terrible disorder\n[09:07] where your legs start to feel as though\n[09:09] they've got this sort of creepy crawly\n[09:11] feeling and you've constantly got to\n[09:12] massage them and move them. It's a\n[09:14] terrible disruptor of your sleep. All of\n[09:16] these disorders are marketkedly\n[09:18] undiagnosed, by the way. And then you've\n[09:21] got another collection of individuals\n[09:24] who they don't have any sleep disorders,\n[09:28] but they are either doing things that\n[09:30] will dismantle their sleep. So, either\n[09:33] they're taking on things into themselves\n[09:36] like alcohol, caffeine, THC that aren't\n[09:39] the sleep helpers, even though sometimes\n[09:42] they think they are. And then you've got\n[09:44] perhaps the internal things that will\n[09:47] prevent you from sleeping well. Things\n[09:48] like stress and anxiety. And then you've\n[09:51] also just got life itself that can get\n[09:54] in the way. And then moving from the\n[09:57] sleep disorders realm to the I don't\n[10:00] have a sleep disorder, but I'm probably\n[10:01] not doing it right quote unquote when it\n[10:04] comes to sleep. Then you've got the\n[10:06] people who are obsessed about getting it\n[10:09] right and they are the bio optimizers.\n[10:12] this sort of the you know the biohackers\n[10:15] and then you've also got I work with a\n[10:17] lot of high performance individuals who\n[10:20] are really trying to just scratch out\n[10:22] those last couple of percentages either\n[10:24] if it's in business or often we're\n[10:27] working with professional athletes.\n[10:29] These are the people for whom two or\n[10:31] three percentage point changes can be\n[10:34] tens of millions of dollars or they can\n[10:37] be the difference between standing on a\n[10:38] podium at the Olympics or not. And so\n[10:42] there's there's a broad collection of\n[10:43] wonderful characters.\n[10:45] >> And since we last spoke, is there now a\n[10:47] lot of new sleep science and\n[10:49] understanding as it relates to sleep\n[10:51] performance and these three categories\n[10:53] of sleep deficient sleep disorders,\n[10:55] lifestyle factors and then the\n[10:57] optimizers.\n[10:58] >> Yeah, I think there's there's a broad\n[11:00] collection of new evidence that we have.\n[11:03] But maybe let me come on to the middle\n[11:06] group. You know, I used to say that for\n[11:08] people who were deficient in their\n[11:10] sleep, that sleep wasn't like the bank,\n[11:14] that you can't accumulate a debt. Oh,\n[11:17] here we go. Okay. So, what we can see\n[11:20] here is that the jar used to be full,\n[11:22] full of sleep credit when you're\n[11:24] sleeping well. And then during the week,\n[11:27] I'm short sleeping. So, maybe I'm only\n[11:29] getting five hours a night. So, I'm\n[11:31] constantly going into debt. So, I'm\n[11:33] losing all of this wonderful sleep\n[11:35] credit and my system is building up this\n[11:38] collateral debt. And then we used to\n[11:41] think that sleep was not like the bank.\n[11:43] That once you've gone into debt,\n[11:45] unfortunately,\n[11:49] the lid is closed and even at the\n[11:51] weekend, if you try to pay it back, you\n[11:54] can't put back credit into the system.\n[11:58] However, there was a study published\n[12:00] from what's called the UK Bioank, which\n[12:02] is this incredible data set. It's\n[12:05] revolutionary. And they studied in this\n[12:07] particular research uh paper over 90,000\n[12:10] individuals. And what they did was they\n[12:13] essentially split them down into those\n[12:15] individuals who were short sleeping\n[12:17] during the week and then short sleeping\n[12:19] at the weekend. And they compared them\n[12:21] to those individuals who were short\n[12:23] sleeping during the week, but then long\n[12:26] sleeping at the weekend. They were doing\n[12:27] catch-up sleep.\n[12:28] >> That's me.\n[12:29] >> And that's so many individuals. It turns\n[12:31] out if you look at the data, it's it's\n[12:33] remarkable how many people do this this\n[12:35] catch-up sleep behavior. But what was\n[12:37] amazing is that in the people who were\n[12:39] short sleeping during the week but long\n[12:40] sleeping at the weekend, they had a 20%\n[12:44] reduced cardiovascular disease risk\n[12:47] relative to the people who were short\n[12:49] sleeping during the week but also short\n[12:51] sleeping at the weekend. Now, to be\n[12:54] clear, both of those groups had a higher\n[12:57] cardiovascular disease risk than people\n[12:59] who were sleeping sufficiently during\n[13:01] the week and sleeping sufficiently\n[13:03] during the weekend. So, I'm not saying\n[13:05] that it's a completely free lunch. But\n[13:07] for the first time, we realized that at\n[13:10] least one system, major organ system in\n[13:13] your body is like the bank, which is\n[13:15] that if your heart at the weekend\n[13:23] you can\n[13:25] just keep putting credit back and your\n[13:29] system doesn't suffer as much\n[13:30] >> for your heart.\n[13:31] >> For your heart.\n[13:32] >> Okay.\n[13:33] >> But again, many of the other major\n[13:35] physiological systems don't show that.\n[13:37] So work by people like Kenneth Wright at\n[13:39] the University of Boulder, Colorado,\n[13:40] he's shown that your immune system\n[13:42] doesn't rebound after long sleep at the\n[13:44] weekend, your regulation of blood sugar,\n[13:47] your cognitive ability. So that's one\n[13:50] way in which I've changed my mind\n[13:51] regarding sleep in the bank. But there's\n[13:54] a very different new set of data that\n[13:56] has changed my mind completely about\n[13:58] this idea of sleep and the bank. Now\n[14:01] what we've just discussed here is to say\n[14:04] I went into debt and then I was hoping\n[14:08] to try and pay it off with credit at the\n[14:10] weekend.\n[14:10] >> So the jar represents the debt that you\n[14:12] have the sleep.\n[14:13] >> Correct. Yeah. And what I'm trying to do\n[14:15] is force more coinage\n[14:21] in at the weekend to see if I can offset\n[14:25] the debt that I created and get back to\n[14:27] net net neutral by the end of the\n[14:29] weekend. Now, it turns out you can't do\n[14:31] that even if you sleep for as long as\n[14:34] you want. But here's this new remarkable\n[14:37] data. It came from um Walter Reed\n[14:39] Medical Army Institute, a researcher\n[14:41] called Thomas Balkan. And what he was\n[14:43] interested in was flipping the direction\n[14:45] of the question. Not if I go into debt,\n[14:49] can I pay back with credit, but what if\n[14:52] I know in future I'm going to face a\n[14:55] debt, an upcoming debt, can I do sleep\n[14:58] banking?\n[14:59] >> Oh, so if I've got a big thing coming up\n[15:01] where I'm traveling across the world and\n[15:03] I know I'm going to be sleep deficient,\n[15:04] can I sleep a lot before it to create a\n[15:09] What would the financial analogy be? The\n[15:11] financial analogy would be, let's say\n[15:12] that we're coming up to Christmas.\n[15:15] >> Yeah.\n[15:16] >> And you're going to spend lots on, you\n[15:18] know, presents and all sorts of stuff.\n[15:20] So, I know that in October and November,\n[15:23] I'm going to tighten my financial belt.\n[15:25] >> I see.\n[15:26] >> So that when I go into the sort of\n[15:28] Christmas period and I'm spending a lot\n[15:30] more money, my bank account isn't hit as\n[15:33] hard. I don't go into as much of a sort\n[15:36] of a debt situation because I've built\n[15:38] up credit. So you can create sleep\n[15:40] savings.\n[15:41] >> Correct. It's a sleepsaving system. So\n[15:44] essentially, you know, what he was able\n[15:46] to do, not just put the jar to full, but\n[15:52] he was actually packing in even more\n[15:57] so that you almost got this wonderful\n[16:04] overflow of sleep.\n[16:05] >> How did he know?\n[16:07] >> He didn't. It was the experimental\n[16:09] hypothesis.\n[16:10] >> And but how did they prove it?\n[16:12] >> So what they did is that they woke you\n[16:14] up to a period when you're going to have\n[16:16] two or three nights of either no sleep\n[16:19] or marketked sleep reduction. And in the\n[16:22] week beforehand with these army\n[16:24] cadetses, instead of being limited to 8\n[16:27] hours of time in bed, they were able to\n[16:29] get 10 hours of time in bed and they\n[16:32] could sleep all that they want. And so\n[16:34] they went from probably an average of\n[16:36] about 7 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep to\n[16:39] about 8 and 1/2 almost 9 hours of sleep.\n[16:43] So they were extending their sleep\n[16:45] duration\n[16:47] and so that they had built up this\n[16:49] buffer. It's almost like a sort of a a\n[16:52] sleep safety net that's in place so that\n[16:55] when you go into the tumble of sleep\n[16:57] deprivation,\n[16:59] you're sort of almost bolstered and\n[17:02] you're lifted higher and therefore your\n[17:04] degree of impermanment that you suffer\n[17:06] under conditions of sleep deprivation is\n[17:09] significantly less if you banked sleep\n[17:11] beforehand versus those people who were\n[17:14] just sleeping normally and then faced\n[17:16] the deprivation. they went down much\n[17:18] further in terms of their cognitive and\n[17:20] mental performance.\n[17:21] >> So he gave them challenges and tasks to\n[17:23] do correct in two different groups. One\n[17:25] group had sleep savings saved up from\n[17:27] sleeping well the previous week. One\n[17:28] group didn't.\n[17:29] >> That's right.\n[17:29] >> And they performed remarkably different.\n[17:32] >> So both of them were impaired relative\n[17:34] to a sleep rested person. However, the\n[17:37] people it's sort of you know how how\n[17:39] much of a drop\n[17:41] >> in your cognitive performance do you\n[17:42] suffer? And what he found was that\n[17:44] people who had built up this credit,\n[17:47] this savings account of sleep in the\n[17:49] days, in the week beforehand, they\n[17:52] suffered about 40% less of an impairment\n[17:56] relative to the people who had not\n[17:59] created any savings plan. Now, they\n[18:02] weren't in debt. They were just net\n[18:04] neutral.\n[18:05] >> But boy, did they drop quickly. Whereas\n[18:08] those people who'd had some cash in the\n[18:11] sleep credit system, they didn't fall\n[18:14] anywhere near as far. But this is\n[18:16] remarkable for people like you were\n[18:17] saying who are facing, let's say, if\n[18:19] I've got a sprint at work or I'm a\n[18:21] medical doctor, I know I'm about to go\n[18:23] on call for the next 40 hours. You're a\n[18:26] military, aviation, all of the new\n[18:28] parents. All of these circumstances are\n[18:31] places where now we know athletes is a\n[18:33] great example. When we work with a\n[18:35] athletes, people like Michael Grner have\n[18:37] demonstrated that athletes sleep\n[18:39] terribly typically the night before a\n[18:42] huge performance. No matter, you know,\n[18:43] of course, they're nerves.\n[18:45] >> But what you can do is you can have them\n[18:47] bank sleep in the days before when\n[18:49] they're not as nervous and therefore\n[18:51] their performance doesn't suffer as much\n[18:53] even though they know they're going to\n[18:55] be deprived.\n[18:56] >> Sleep is so important, isn't it? And I\n[18:58] think everybody now knows that because\n[18:59] of people like yourself or really, you\n[19:01] know, you were the real pioneer in\n[19:02] pushing the subject into the world. I\n[19:03] remember when you first went on Joe\n[19:05] Rogan's show, the amount of my friends\n[19:07] that sent me that episode and then sent\n[19:08] me your book was just staggering. It was\n[19:10] like that was the catalyst moment, I\n[19:12] think, in society for the mainstream to\n[19:14] really start talking and caring about\n[19:15] sleep. However, there's still so many\n[19:18] people struggling um because of all the\n[19:21] factors that you talked about when we're\n[19:23] talking about group two who have those\n[19:24] lifestyle factors, the stress, the\n[19:26] psychological factors, the trauma, etc.,\n[19:28] etc.\n[19:30] What can we give them, those people, the\n[19:33] people that really really struggle,\n[19:34] maybe they haven't got a disorder. We'll\n[19:35] come to the people with sort of sleep\n[19:36] disorders later and we'll talk about\n[19:38] optimizers. But what what is the new\n[19:40] information or advice that we can give\n[19:43] them that will help them once and for\n[19:46] all sleep 8 hours a night and get their\n[19:49] life back?\n[19:51] >> If you were to push me to say what are\n[19:52] the three most\n[19:55] impactful things that you can start\n[19:57] doing tonight to start sleeping better,\n[20:00] it would be the following.\n[20:03] Digital detox.\n[20:05] >> Okay, let me write this down. Digital\n[20:06] detox. Okay, what does that mean?\n[20:08] >> 1 hour before bed,\n[20:11] try to limit\n[20:13] activating social media engagement,\n[20:17] email, and text messages that are going\n[20:21] to trigger you.\n[20:22] >> It's fine to listen to a podcast, you\n[20:24] know.\n[20:25] >> Thank God for that.\n[20:26] >> You heard it here, folks.\n[20:28] >> Right from that book.\n[20:29] >> But it's also good to like and\n[20:30] subscribe, would you say? I would say\n[20:32] that you know like and subscribe and\n[20:34] then just click here so that you get the\n[20:36] latest notification you get that bell\n[20:38] just click on the bell icon so that you\n[20:42] >> so it's not a problem of blue light a\n[20:46] quick aside we've been taught this myth\n[20:48] of the blue light effect\n[20:50] >> from devices and it really is a myth\n[20:53] because an incredible Australian\n[20:54] researcher a guy called Michael Gradazar\n[20:57] has almost singlehandedly\n[20:59] changed the the what I think of as being\n[21:02] the zeitgeist for a while after a very\n[21:04] influential paper which is a great paper\n[21:06] and what they showed was that 1 hour of\n[21:08] iPad reading before bed ended up\n[21:10] impairing your melatonin it disrupted\n[21:13] sleep it reduced the amount of dream\n[21:15] sleep and even after they stopped\n[21:17] reading the iPad the blast radius impact\n[21:20] on your dream sleep lasted a week it's\n[21:22] almost like the drug needed to get\n[21:23] washed out the system that even when you\n[21:26] you'd stop using technology for an hour\n[21:28] before bed the impact of that technology\n[21:31] ology even though you'd stopped using it\n[21:33] could still be seen in the echo of sleep\n[21:35] disruption for a week later. It was a\n[21:37] very influential study in a very\n[21:39] prestigious channel.\n[21:40] >> When was that a while ago?\n[21:41] >> That was probably about 10 years ago.\n[21:42] But then Michael Gretazar, this\n[21:44] incredible Australian researcher started\n[21:46] to say, well, I can't replicate these\n[21:48] findings.\n[21:49] And what he was discovering is that it's\n[21:51] not the blue light that's the problem.\n[21:53] Now, the blue light will change aspects\n[21:55] of your melatonin. And melatonin is a\n[21:57] hormone. It simply tells your brain and\n[21:59] your body when it's nighttime, when it's\n[22:01] time to fall asleep. It doesn't\n[22:02] participate in the generation of sleep.\n[22:04] Melatonin is like the starting official\n[22:06] at the 100 meter race. It brings all of\n[22:08] the races to the line and it begins the\n[22:11] timing of the race, but it doesn't\n[22:13] participate in the creation of the race\n[22:14] itself. That's a different set of\n[22:16] chemicals.\n[22:16] >> It doesn't make you go to sleep. It\n[22:18] doesn't make you and if you look at what\n[22:19] we call meta analyses where we gather\n[22:21] together all of the individual studies\n[22:23] on a topic and we put them in a big\n[22:25] statistical bucket. What they found is\n[22:27] that melatonin will only improve the\n[22:28] speed with which you fall asleep by\n[22:31] about um 3.4 minutes and it will only\n[22:34] increase the efficiency of your sleep by\n[22:37] about 2.2%. So not much more than\n[22:40] placebo. Um, so melatonin is it it's now\n[22:45] the placebo effect is the most reliable\n[22:47] effect in all of pharmarmacology. So you\n[22:50] know maybe no harm no foul I would say\n[22:52] and don't forget I will come back to the\n[22:54] three but when it comes to melatonin be\n[22:56] careful more isn't always better and you\n[23:00] run the risk of confusing your morning\n[23:04] brain into a dense nighttime fog. And\n[23:08] what I mean by that is\n[23:10] 10 milligrams or 20 milligrams of\n[23:12] melatonin is what we call a supra\n[23:15] physiological dose, which again is just\n[23:17] a fancy medical term to say it's a size\n[23:19] of magnitude of melatonin that your body\n[23:22] would never naturally release. It's far\n[23:24] greater. So melatonin is the signal of\n[23:27] darkness. And normally by the morning\n[23:29] hours, our natural release of melatonin\n[23:32] has stopped and you're down to zero\n[23:34] levels again\n[23:35] >> in the morning.\n[23:35] >> In the morning. So, you wake up and your\n[23:37] body no longer has the signal of\n[23:39] melatonin saying it's night, it's night,\n[23:41] it's night. But if you've dosed yourself\n[23:43] with 10 milligs or 20 milligs of\n[23:45] melatonin, you run the risk of saying,\n[23:48] well, yes, I know it quote unquote\n[23:50] knocks me out. But the problem is in the\n[23:53] first, you know, 3 or 4 hours of the\n[23:54] waking morning, you're struggling\n[23:57] because you're in this fog of a hormonal\n[24:00] melatonin, a hormonal signal saying it's\n[24:03] still pitch black. No, it's not. It's\n[24:05] bright light outside, but your body is\n[24:07] fooled into thinking it's pitch black\n[24:08] because you've dosed yourself too high.\n[24:11] And no wonder you're reaching for two or\n[24:13] three cups of coffee in the morning. So,\n[24:15] what what dose of melatonin should I be\n[24:17] taking?\n[24:17] >> Somewhere between probably about 0.1 to\n[24:21] 3 millig.\n[24:23] >> And do you advise melatonin for people?\n[24:25] >> Yes, in two conditions. The first or\n[24:28] circumstances I should say. The first is\n[24:30] when you're going through jet lag.\n[24:32] Wonderfully helpful. But timing is\n[24:35] critical. You need to create that sort\n[24:37] of that artificial signal of night\n[24:40] because let's say that you and I here in\n[24:42] Los Angeles, we're both going to fly\n[24:43] back to London tomorrow and London is 8\n[24:47] hours ahead. So, we fly overnight. We\n[24:50] arrive in London and then that first\n[24:52] night, let's say we decide to go to bed\n[24:55] uh or I decide to go to bed in the hotel\n[24:57] at midnight. The problem is here in Los\n[25:00] Angeles and my body clock, it's still\n[25:02] 400 p.m. because London's 8 hours ahead.\n[25:05] So, my melatonin is not going to rise\n[25:08] for probably another 6 or 7 hours. So, I\n[25:10] need to artificially hijack my melatonin\n[25:14] system and tell my brain, \"Oh, no, it's\n[25:16] not 400 p.m. It's instead it's\n[25:19] midnight.\" And so, there under\n[25:21] conditions of jet lag, very helpful. The\n[25:24] second is if you have a circadian rhythm\n[25:26] disorder. Let's say that you're someone\n[25:28] who has a an advanced circadian phase.\n[25:32] What that means is you're someone who\n[25:33] really can't get sleepy until 3 or 4 in\n[25:36] the morning and you would prefer to be\n[25:38] sleeping throughout most of the day. So\n[25:40] you you're almost nocturnal.\n[25:41] >> Is that a genetic disorder?\n[25:43] >> And yes, it's a genetic disorder in\n[25:45] part.\n[25:45] >> How many people have that? probably one\n[25:48] to two% of the population have a very\n[25:50] severe adv what we call an advanced\n[25:52] circadian phase disorder but their\n[25:55] melatonin can also be helpful because\n[25:57] once again their melatonin part of their\n[25:59] problem is that their melatonin is very\n[26:00] delayed so they don't get the signal of\n[26:03] oh it's night until maybe 4:00 in the\n[26:06] morning you and I we start to get our\n[26:08] signal of melatonin depending on our\n[26:10] chronotype by somewhere between about 9\n[26:13] 10 or 11 p.m. they may be delayed by 5\n[26:16] hours. So if we can give them melatonin,\n[26:18] we can artificially try to fool their\n[26:20] brain into thinking it's actually\n[26:23] earlier in their biological rhythm. So\n[26:25] they sleep earlier and they're more in\n[26:27] sync with the rest of society.\n[26:29] >> How does someone know if they're that\n[26:30] type of person if they have that\n[26:31] disorder? Is there there's not a way to\n[26:33] test, is there?\n[26:34] >> Well, what we typically do is we will\n[26:36] bring you into a laboratory and we will\n[26:38] measure your innate level. So we will\n[26:40] shut out sort of all windows. All clock\n[26:42] faces are gone and we just let you run\n[26:45] your natural rhythm.\n[26:46] >> And they have the same rise and fall in\n[26:49] melatonin just like you and I do. Except\n[26:52] where it's doing that rise and fall of\n[26:54] melatonin on the 24-hour clock face is\n[26:57] radically different.\n[26:58] >> Okay?\n[26:58] >> For you and I, it's, you know, 910 p.m.\n[27:01] 11:00 p.m. at night when we're starting\n[27:03] that melatonin crescendo.\n[27:05] >> For them, it's 4:00 in the morning. So,\n[27:06] we can measure it. It's not in their\n[27:08] minds. It's not their choice. It's a\n[27:10] biological edict.\n[27:12] >> Are you concerned that melatonin is\n[27:15] becoming more and more popular as a way\n[27:17] to solve lifestyle issues that have\n[27:21] caused sleep impairment? Because I'm\n[27:23] seeing loads of, you know, I'm an\n[27:25] investor, so I see lots of companies now\n[27:26] pitching me different products that have\n[27:29] melatonin in them as a sort of\n[27:31] day-to-day sleeping supplement.\n[27:33] >> I think I'm really torn. I've been on\n[27:36] both sides of this argument and I'm\n[27:39] cautious about it for two reasons. The\n[27:41] first is in pediatric populations here\n[27:43] in the United States.\n[27:45] >> Pediatric\n[27:46] >> Yeah. So the people's use of melatonin\n[27:49] in kids is increasing. So in pediatric\n[27:52] populations it's increasing\n[27:54] exponentially. And in fact, if you go\n[27:57] down the sort of the supermarket aisles\n[27:59] here in America, often if you go into\n[28:01] sort of the the health sort of food\n[28:04] section, there's this big purple\n[28:05] section. That's the melatonin section.\n[28:08] And a large proportion of that is there\n[28:10] dedicated to gummies for your children\n[28:13] with melatonin.\n[28:15] And there was a study that was published\n[28:18] about three years ago that showed here\n[28:20] in America over the past 10 years there\n[28:23] has been a 53%\n[28:25] increase in poisonous overdose\n[28:28] admissions to hospitals of melatonin in\n[28:31] the past 10 years. 503%\n[28:34] increase. So firstly, we've got to be a\n[28:36] bit careful. The second reason is that\n[28:39] melatonin is a bioactive hormone and\n[28:42] it's also involved in reproductive\n[28:44] development. And there studies done back\n[28:45] in the 1970s I think where they were\n[28:48] looking at juvenile male rats which is\n[28:50] to say male rats who are going through\n[28:52] adolescence\n[28:53] and they were dosing them with high\n[28:55] amounts of melatonin and what they found\n[28:57] is that that stunted the development of\n[29:00] the testes of the testicles and it\n[29:03] caused testicular atrophy. Now, these\n[29:05] were very high doses, but we've got to\n[29:07] be a little bit careful. We think we\n[29:09] say, \"Well, melatonin is a natural\n[29:11] hormone, so anything natural is safe.\"\n[29:14] Melatonin overall in terms of its safety\n[29:16] profile is very safe. It's actually a\n[29:18] very good antioxidant.\n[29:20] But you've got to be careful because\n[29:22] things like for example testosterone\n[29:24] supplementation in males what we know is\n[29:26] that if you're injecting testosterone\n[29:29] after a while after maybe 18 months or\n[29:31] so the testicles themselves will stop\n[29:34] producing their own testosterone and\n[29:37] even if you stop the administration of\n[29:39] the exogenous testosterone the injection\n[29:43] the testes never return their function\n[29:46] of producing testosterone.\n[29:48] Now, we don't have any evidence yet that\n[29:50] that's the case that if you keep taking\n[29:51] melatonin at high dose, your body, the\n[29:53] fear would be shuts down its own natural\n[29:56] production of melatonin. I've seen no\n[29:57] evidence of that. In fact, I've seen\n[29:59] evidence the contrary that even after\n[30:02] about 6 months or even 12 months in\n[30:03] certain small cities, when you stop\n[30:06] melatonin, the production starts again\n[30:08] naturally. It seems fine. Problem is,\n[30:11] people haven't been taking melatonin for\n[30:13] just 12 months. They've been taking it\n[30:15] for years.\n[30:17] We've got no idea what happens after\n[30:19] years.\n[30:20] >> That was my hesitation when the first\n[30:21] time someone offered me melatonin is\n[30:23] from doing this podcast and speaking to\n[30:24] smart people like yourself, I've come to\n[30:27] learn this sort of principle that if you\n[30:29] start making something for your body in\n[30:31] terms of a hormone, if you start sort of\n[30:33] um consuming something externally like\n[30:36] testosterone, your body will say fine, I\n[30:37] don't need to do this. It will try and\n[30:39] return to that level of balance where\n[30:40] the quantities in your system are\n[30:42] maintained, which means it kind of\n[30:43] learns to shut down. And I always think\n[30:45] about the case of testosterone because\n[30:47] men know that if we start injecting\n[30:48] testosterone then we're going to have to\n[30:50] pretty much do it forever.\n[30:51] >> Yeah.\n[30:51] >> Um if we want those levels to be the\n[30:53] same.\n[30:53] >> Yeah. That's the worry is that there are\n[30:55] no free lunches in biology and usually\n[30:57] if you fight biology you typically lose.\n[31:00] >> There's always a tradeoff and some of my\n[31:02] friends often like talk to me about like\n[31:04] these miracle things or this thing or\n[31:05] take medafanol and everything will be\n[31:07] fine and da but what's the trade-off?\n[31:09] And I get most concerned when they say\n[31:11] there isn't one\n[31:12] >> cuz then I go we don't know it.\n[31:14] >> Yeah, you've got to be careful because\n[31:16] absence of evidence is not evidence of\n[31:19] absence.\n[31:22] >> Be very careful when you're doing that\n[31:24] deal with with your physiology. So to\n[31:28] come back to sort of the three things,\n[31:29] the first thing we were mentioning is\n[31:31] digital detox and don't worry about the\n[31:34] blue light. Worry about light in\n[31:36] general. I'll come on to that because\n[31:37] that's the second. But Michael Gratazar\n[31:39] as I was saying what he found is that\n[31:41] the blue light doesn't really disrupt\n[31:42] your sleep. It's a combination of first\n[31:45] these devices that we use are attention\n[31:48] capture devices and they are designed to\n[31:52] fleece you of your attention economy and\n[31:54] they do it ruthlessly well. They've\n[31:57] spent tens of millions of dollars\n[31:58] designing these products to do that. So\n[32:01] what happens is that these devices\n[32:03] become hugely activating and as a result\n[32:07] they essentially will be a mute button\n[32:10] on your sleepiness. So you could be\n[32:11] there, you get into bed, it's 11 p.m.\n[32:13] You think, I am so tired. I was falling\n[32:15] asleep on the the the couch watching\n[32:17] television and then you get into bed,\n[32:18] you start going onto social media and\n[32:20] then you start doom scrolling and then\n[32:21] you get into this what we call bed\n[32:23] rotting where you just sit there and now\n[32:25] you look at the clock and it's no longer\n[32:27] 11 p.m. It's 1:00 a.m. and you've just\n[32:30] done sleep procrastination. Now it turns\n[32:32] out that it's yes that that these are\n[32:35] attentiongrabbing devices that will mute\n[32:38] your sleepiness, but you have to be of a\n[32:40] certain personality type. He found not\n[32:43] all of us are vulnerable to this sleep\n[32:45] disruption of devices. You have to be\n[32:47] someone who is perhaps neurotic, someone\n[32:50] who has high impulsivity or someone who\n[32:53] is perhaps high anxious. If you are of\n[32:55] any of those kinds, you should be really\n[32:58] careful about your use of technology in\n[33:00] the bedroom. Now, for me to, you know,\n[33:03] sit here and say, look, put your phone\n[33:06] in the car, in the garage, and that way,\n[33:08] you know, that's what I would love\n[33:10] because what we've learned to do in this\n[33:13] modern era is the first thing when you\n[33:15] wake up, what is it that you do?\n[33:18] >> No, no comment.\n[33:21] >> Lots of you.\n[33:22] >> You,\n[33:24] >> it's just you and I, Stephen. Um,\n[33:26] >> I grab my phone before my eyes are even\n[33:28] open. And what happens is this sort of\n[33:30] small tsunami of anxiety washes over you\n[33:33] because as soon as you unlock the phone,\n[33:35] it's everyone else's agenda for your day\n[33:37] but your own. And it's a terrible way to\n[33:39] wake up. Have you ever had the\n[33:41] experience where you've got to wake up\n[33:43] for an early morning flight? And it's a\n[33:44] critical flight. You know that that\n[33:47] night is not going to be a good night of\n[33:49] sleep. It's going to be a shallow kind\n[33:50] of sleep. It's what we call anticipatory\n[33:53] anxiety. You are anticipating an anxious\n[33:57] event in the morning. And studies have\n[34:00] shown that when we create this\n[34:01] anticipatory anxiety, the amount of deep\n[34:04] sleep that you have drops significantly.\n[34:07] You don't sleep as well. And therefore,\n[34:10] if we just do this little sort of\n[34:12] version, this lit version of the morning\n[34:15] flight, which is we know that when we go\n[34:17] to bed and we put our phone down, we\n[34:20] know that when we wake up every morning,\n[34:21] we're just going to open it up to that\n[34:23] hit of anxiety every morning. No wonder\n[34:26] our sleep can start to get shallow. Now,\n[34:29] I'm not going to sit here and say,\n[34:31] \"Well, don't take your phone into the\n[34:33] bedroom because the genie is out the\n[34:34] bottle and no matter what I say, it's\n[34:36] not going back in anytime soon.\" And a\n[34:38] friend of mine, Michael Brander, has got\n[34:40] this beautiful uh framework where he\n[34:43] says you can take your phone into your\n[34:44] bedroom. It's fine.\n[34:46] But you can only use your phone\n[34:50] standing up.\n[34:53] >> What's his name?\n[34:54] >> Michael Grande. He's brilliant.\n[34:56] >> Mind his own business.\n[34:58] >> And and what happens is that you you're\n[35:00] there and you think after about seven or\n[35:01] eight minutes, I'm just I'm just going\n[35:03] to have a bit of a sit down here. as\n[35:05] soon as that phone goes away. So I would\n[35:07] say that digital detox is the first\n[35:10] friend that will really help your sleep.\n[35:13] The the second is regularity. And we'll\n[35:16] come on to regularity when we speak\n[35:18] about you know what really makes for\n[35:19] good sleep. If you were to only do one\n[35:22] thing, not three things, but just one\n[35:24] thing. Go to bed and wake up at the same\n[35:27] time. No matter whether it's the weekday\n[35:28] or the weekend, regularity is king.\n[35:32] >> Okay. So that's the third pillar. That's\n[35:34] correct. Regularity.\n[35:36] >> Okay. And then I have\n[35:40] the T for timing.\n[35:41] >> Correct.\n[35:42] >> Which we'll go through these. Um\n[35:44] quantity, which we've talked a little\n[35:45] bit about already, and quality.\n[35:47] >> Correct. So when I looked at the\n[35:50] science, for me, I created this\n[35:52] framework of the four macros of good\n[35:54] sleep. You've heard of the three macros\n[35:55] of food, macronutrients, fat, protein,\n[35:58] carbohydrate. To me, there are four\n[36:00] macros of good sleep. And it's QQQRT.\n[36:03] QQRT and it stands for quantity,\n[36:13] quality,\n[36:16] regularity,\n[36:18] and timing. And think of it less like\n[36:21] pillars, but the four legs of a chair.\n[36:24] And if any one of these becomes\n[36:25] unstable, the chair will topple over.\n[36:28] So, I'll probably start with the one\n[36:30] that people have heard me bang on about,\n[36:32] which is quantity. 7 to 9 hours. This\n[36:35] myth of 8 hours is nonsense. It's a\n[36:38] wonderful range. 7 to 9 hours. And what\n[36:41] we know is that using that sweet spot of\n[36:43] 7 to 9 hours, when you get less than\n[36:46] that, the shorter your sleep, the\n[36:48] shorter your life.\n[36:50] >> Short sleep predicts all cause\n[36:52] mortality. Now, we say that there's the\n[36:54] minimum of 7 hours of sleep. And some\n[36:57] people have argued perhaps correctly\n[36:58] that look, if you look at these\n[37:00] mortality curves, there's not much of a\n[37:02] percentage difference between sleeping\n[37:04] six hours versus the seven that you're\n[37:06] telling me is minimum. So 6 hours is\n[37:09] just fine. So all of this nonsense and\n[37:11] rhetoric is is is silly from you. And I\n[37:14] think they've made a conflation\n[37:17] because\n[37:18] 7 hours is the minimum amount of sleep\n[37:22] that you need to survive. Because the\n[37:25] way that we quantify what minimum is is\n[37:28] based on whether you die or you don't\n[37:30] prematurely,\n[37:33] the amount of sleep that you need to\n[37:35] survive is different than the amount of\n[37:38] sleep that you need to thrive. And\n[37:41] people will conflate the former with the\n[37:43] latter. So you've got to be careful when\n[37:45] people are sort of touting on social\n[37:46] media saying, \"Well, no, but look, you\n[37:48] there's not much difference between my\n[37:50] sort of survival rate on 6 hours versus\n[37:52] 7 hours.\" You may have a just as much of\n[37:55] a long life, but the quality of your\n[37:57] life will be very different. So that's\n[37:59] quantity 7 to n hours. And is that does\n[38:03] it change for parents, by the way?\n[38:04] Because I've met so many parents that\n[38:06] seem to be functioning better than me\n[38:07] and they've got four they're having like\n[38:08] four or five hours sleep. Did evolution\n[38:10] not give parents any leeway or anything\n[38:12] when they have kids that suddenly their\n[38:14] brain changes and now they can survive\n[38:16] with less sleep? The evidence doesn't\n[38:18] suggest that once you go through\n[38:20] parenthood, you get some magic sort of,\n[38:23] you know, immunity shot that makes you,\n[38:26] you know, resilient and not vulnerable\n[38:29] to a lack of sleep. And in some ways you\n[38:31] could argue because we used to, you\n[38:33] know, live as a collective tribe and we\n[38:36] would share duties at that point, you\n[38:39] know, mother nature doesn't really worry\n[38:41] too much about you now because you've\n[38:44] already procreated and you've passed on\n[38:46] your genetic code. So you are now the\n[38:50] the sort of the you know the not\n[38:52] particularly well you know cured for\n[38:54] individual through evolution. It's your\n[38:57] offspring gets\n[38:59] >> so it sacrifices you in a way. I mean\n[39:01] that's what we see in the animal\n[39:02] kingdom. Did you see that documentary\n[39:04] about the octopus?\n[39:05] >> Yeah, it it was just I mean I thought it\n[39:07] was beautiful documentary but um\n[39:09] >> the TLDDR for anyone that hasn't seen it\n[39:11] is once the octop and I'm going to\n[39:12] completely butcher this so please ignore\n[39:14] um once the octopus has given birth it\n[39:18] dies. Basically it doesn't move out of\n[39:20] that hole and it dies. Is that a rough?\n[39:23] >> Well, I don't know if if it dies, but\n[39:25] its level of of active life.\n[39:27] >> I searched, does the octopus die after\n[39:30] reproduction, and it says yes. Female\n[39:31] octopuses die after their eggs hatch.\n[39:33] After laying eggs, a female stops eating\n[39:36] and devotes all of her energy to\n[39:38] protecting and oxygenating them until\n[39:41] they hatch. Once they do, she dies\n[39:43] shortly after, a process called semiol\n[39:46] parity, meaning they reproduce only\n[39:49] once. This death is triggered by hormone\n[39:51] changes from the optic gland similar to\n[39:55] mamalian proterty glands. And males die\n[39:59] shortly after mating as well, usually\n[40:01] within a few months.\n[40:04] That is wild\n[40:05] >> in some ways. It's, you know, it's it's\n[40:06] tragic and it reminds me I'm so glad\n[40:08] that I'm not an octopus. But\n[40:12] but but coming back to it, so for there\n[40:16] doesn't seem to be some you know magic\n[40:19] cloak of invincibility that you put on\n[40:22] when you go through parenthood.\n[40:24] Certainly what we know is that the\n[40:26] number of individuals who can survive on\n[40:29] 6 hours of sleep or less and show no\n[40:31] impairment in either their brain or\n[40:33] their body rounded to a whole number and\n[40:36] expressed as a percent of the population\n[40:38] is zero.\n[40:40] So quantity matters but it turns out\n[40:43] that we got it wrong in thinking that\n[40:45] was the only thing because then came\n[40:49] quality. So QQRT quality is defined in\n[40:53] sleep science as two things. The first\n[40:55] is something that your sleep tracker\n[40:57] will measure which is the continuity of\n[40:59] your sleep. Meaning do you sleep in one\n[41:02] or two nice long bouts throughout the\n[41:04] night? That's good quality of sleep,\n[41:06] nice continuous bouts versus your sort\n[41:09] of sleep is very fragmented by all of\n[41:11] these awakenings. That's very poor\n[41:13] quality of sleep. And the way that you\n[41:15] can measure it in your sleep tracker is\n[41:17] just by looking at the app. And there'll\n[41:19] be something called sleep efficiency.\n[41:21] Sleep efficiency is defined as the\n[41:23] following. Of the time that you're in\n[41:24] bed, what percent of that time is spent\n[41:27] asleep? And what we like to see is you\n[41:30] north of 85% or above. So, this is kind\n[41:32] of like the users's guide to sleep\n[41:34] trackers. What I want to see is 85% or\n[41:38] more. If you're less than that, we need\n[41:39] to have a conversation. That's number\n[41:41] one, good quality of sleep. The second,\n[41:44] which is what sort of what these\n[41:46] trackers can't really do, but I can do\n[41:48] in the sleep laboratory when you look\n[41:49] like a spaghetti monster cuz I put\n[41:51] electrodes all over your head. I can\n[41:53] measure the quality of your big, deep,\n[41:55] slow brain waves of deep non-REM sleep.\n[41:58] And that is a second measure. The power\n[42:00] of those big slow brain waves. That's a\n[42:03] second measure. And quality seems to be\n[42:06] as predictive as quantity in making a\n[42:10] difference not just to your all cause\n[42:12] mortality but quality even more than\n[42:15] quantity when it comes to mental health\n[42:18] has been showing the bigger signal. So\n[42:21] again it's not that quantity doesn't\n[42:23] matter. You do have to get sufficient\n[42:25] amounts of sleep but quality as much as\n[42:28] quantity should be paid attention to and\n[42:31] I haven't said that enough.\n[42:33] >> Mhm.\n[42:34] >> The next is where we came to in our sort\n[42:36] of three things that I was saying. The\n[42:37] first is digital detox. Then next thing\n[42:39] I said is regularity.\n[42:42] This is somewhere where I've also\n[42:43] changed my mind on. I've doubled down on\n[42:46] regularity. There was a study that also\n[42:48] came out of that same data set that I\n[42:50] described. It's called the UK Bioank\n[42:52] data. And now they didn't look at 90,000\n[42:54] individuals, but they looked at 60,000\n[42:56] individuals. And they decided that they\n[42:59] were going to compare and split them\n[43:02] into quartiles. So the most regular to\n[43:05] the second most regular to then sort of\n[43:08] the third most regular and then the\n[43:10] final quartile was those who were the\n[43:12] least regular.\n[43:13] >> And what does regular mean in this\n[43:14] context?\n[43:15] >> Good question. highly regular\n[43:17] individuals plus or minus 15 minutes in\n[43:21] terms of going to bed and waking up at\n[43:22] the same time. In other words, a total\n[43:23] wiggle room of 30 minutes.\n[43:25] >> Oh, okay. So, if I'm always going to bed\n[43:26] at 9:00 p.m. and I do that 5 days in a\n[43:28] row, I'm regular timing really.\n[43:30] >> So, so it's it's regularity in terms of\n[43:32] when you're going to bed and waking up.\n[43:35] >> So, it you're right, it's timing in a\n[43:37] way, but I'll come on to why there is a\n[43:39] separate t for timing in just a second.\n[43:41] But regularity here was okay, plus or\n[43:44] minus. So, let's say you go to bed at\n[43:46] 8:45 p.m. one night and then 9 and then\n[43:49] 9:10 p.m. and then you're back to 8.\n[43:51] That's beautiful tight timing. I like\n[43:53] that. Whereas the those people who were\n[43:55] least regular, they were 90 to 120\n[43:59] minutes desperate. They were going to\n[44:00] bed, let's say, at 11 one night, then 1\n[44:04] a.m. the next night, then they were\n[44:05] going to bed at 10:30 p.m. and then they\n[44:07] were going to bed at 12:30. They were\n[44:09] all over the map. So what they found was\n[44:12] that those people who were most regular\n[44:15] versus least regular, so they compared\n[44:17] the extremes of these two, those people\n[44:20] who were most regular had a 49%\n[44:24] relative decrease in all cause\n[44:26] mortality. So they were 49% less likely\n[44:29] to prematurely die than those people who\n[44:31] were least likely to die. They had a 39%\n[44:35] cancer mortality risk reduction. Great.\n[44:39] they had a 57%\n[44:41] cardioabolic\n[44:43] disease risk reduction. So that was\n[44:46] stunning. That regularity was incredibly\n[44:50] powerful as a predictive signal of your\n[44:52] different forms of mortality. That\n[44:55] wasn't the best part of the paper\n[44:56] though. They had also measured quantity\n[44:59] as well as regularity in these same\n[45:01] individuals. So then they decided to\n[45:04] say, well, I'm going to take our measure\n[45:06] of quantity and regularity and we're\n[45:07] going to put them both in the same\n[45:09] statistical bucket and do a Coke Pepsi\n[45:12] challenge to see which one wins out in\n[45:14] terms of predicting all cause mortality.\n[45:16] We all bet in the sleep field, at least\n[45:18] I did, it was going to be quantity. I\n[45:20] was wrong. Regularity beat out quantity\n[45:23] in predicting all cause mortality and by\n[45:26] quite some margin. Now that doesn't mean\n[45:28] that you can now go away and say, \"I'm\n[45:30] going to start sleeping 4 hours.\" but\n[45:32] incredibly consistent 4 hours. You need\n[45:35] both quantity and quality. But goodness\n[45:38] does regularity seem to carry a massive\n[45:41] signal. So coming back to those three\n[45:43] things, I would say digital detox, just\n[45:45] go to bed and wake up at the same time.\n[45:47] And the final thing is light. In this\n[45:50] modern world, we are a dark deprived\n[45:52] society.\n[45:54] We get what I call junk light at night.\n[45:57] So you've heard of junk DNA. Well, we\n[45:59] get junk light at night.\n[46:01] We don't need all of this light and it\n[46:03] fools our brain into thinking it's still\n[46:05] daytime outside. So no wonder as a\n[46:08] society we have some struggles with\n[46:10] sleep at night. Now that's due to many\n[46:12] reasons. Stress, too much caffeine,\n[46:14] alcohol, THC. But excessive light is one\n[46:18] of the easiest things that you can do.\n[46:20] So for the next 7 days, just do me this\n[46:23] experiment. If you can set an alarm 1\n[46:27] hour before your normal bedtime. When\n[46:30] that alarm goes off, turn off, and I I\n[46:32] do this myself, turn off almost all of\n[46:35] the lights in your house.\n[46:37] >> When you say all of the lights, do you\n[46:38] mean the little red light on my smoke\n[46:40] alarm or\n[46:41] >> No, that's fine. But, you know, so my\n[46:43] wife and I, 1 hour before bed, almost\n[46:45] all the lights, we've got sort of this\n[46:47] little set of this sort of light that\n[46:49] goes around the television, the back of\n[46:50] the television, so it kind of looks like\n[46:52] the television's cool and illuminated. I\n[46:54] will set that down to about 5% of\n[46:57] brightness and all of the rest of the\n[47:00] lights out so you can kind of just still\n[47:02] see some illumination so I'm not sort\n[47:04] of, you know, looking desperately uncool\n[47:07] uh in in front of her when I'm tripping\n[47:08] over things cuz it's complete black, you\n[47:10] know. Then start cooling the house or\n[47:12] the room as best you can to around about\n[47:15] 67 68° Fahrenheit or about 18°C. We can\n[47:19] speak about temperature, but just do\n[47:20] this experiment for the next 7 days. 1\n[47:22] hour before bed, the alarm goes off. You\n[47:25] switch off all of the lights and ask the\n[47:28] following question. Do you feel\n[47:30] sleepier? Is it soporific? Does it make\n[47:32] you feel more sleepy as a result? But\n[47:36] don't stop there. What you've gone and\n[47:38] done is the first positive experiment\n[47:40] which is you've gone from the no\n[47:43] intervention lights are on to then the\n[47:46] Matt's intervention which is now the\n[47:48] lights are off for 1 hour before bed.\n[47:50] Don't just ask is my sleep better when\n[47:52] the lights were out for 1 hour before\n[47:54] bed. Once that 7-day period has\n[47:56] finished, go back to doing what you were\n[47:59] doing before, which is keep all of the\n[48:01] lights on and ask yourself, did my sleep\n[48:04] get better when I did the intervention\n[48:06] and did my sleep go back to being worse\n[48:08] when I stopped? Because I'm trying to\n[48:10] teach you birectionality in the\n[48:12] experiment. Does that make some sense?\n[48:14] >> Yeah. So, you get to you get to\n[48:16] basically do an AB test.\n[48:17] >> Correct. You get to see both sides of\n[48:19] the equation. And with that, it's more\n[48:21] proof positive than just one direction\n[48:22] alone. because who knows it could just\n[48:24] be a placebo effect. So regularity\n[48:27] coming back to it is critical. So we've\n[48:30] spoken about QQR quantity quality\n[48:32] regularity\n[48:33] >> on the um regular\n[48:36] >> regularity point. Why what's going on in\n[48:39] our brain that's making it from a\n[48:41] hormonal perspective or other that's\n[48:43] making it important for us to sleep at\n[48:45] the same time?\n[48:46] >> It's a bloody great question. People\n[48:48] don't respond to rules. They respond to\n[48:50] reasons not rules. So let me try and\n[48:53] explain the reason behind the sort of\n[48:54] the rule. When it comes to regularity,\n[48:57] we have something called a circadian\n[48:59] rhythm that we've spoken about. And\n[49:01] there's a clock that sits inside of your\n[49:04] brain deep in the middle of the brain.\n[49:06] So we have it just turns out a brain\n[49:10] here.\n[49:11] Lovely. Okay. So we've got one of these\n[49:14] hemispheres here. And then I'm just\n[49:16] going to take out what we call the\n[49:18] subcortical sections. So these are the\n[49:20] areas that are below the subcortex. So\n[49:22] here is the brain. So this is the front\n[49:24] of the brain, the back of the brain, top\n[49:26] of the brain, and here's the brain stem.\n[49:28] And it turns out that right in the\n[49:29] middle of the brain, right here, there's\n[49:31] an area called the hypothalamus.\n[49:34] Now here, this structure here, this is\n[49:36] the phalamus. This is the sensory gate\n[49:38] of your brain. So all of your five\n[49:40] senses, sound, touch, taste, smell, they\n[49:42] all flood into this gate called the\n[49:45] phalamus. And then the phalamus will\n[49:47] decide whether it sends those sensory\n[49:49] signals up to your cortex. And when it\n[49:51] sends the signals up to your cortex, you\n[49:54] start processing them and you become\n[49:56] consciously aware of the external world.\n[49:59] Now, as we're falling asleep, just as an\n[50:00] aside, what's interesting is that this\n[50:02] gate, the sensory gate, the phalamus,\n[50:05] once we start to fall asleep, the gate\n[50:07] will close shut. Now your eyes are\n[50:10] technically still seeing, your ears are\n[50:12] still hearing, your tongue is still\n[50:14] tasting, but because the gate of the\n[50:17] phalamus, the sensory gate closes shut,\n[50:20] those signals that are coming into your\n[50:21] brain are no longer sent up to your\n[50:24] cortex. So you stop perceiving the\n[50:26] outside world, which is just simply a\n[50:28] different way of saying you've fallen\n[50:30] asleep. Now the hypothalamus, you've\n[50:34] heard of hypo sort of hypertension or\n[50:36] sort of you know hypothermia or that\n[50:38] means lower. So here's the phalamus.\n[50:42] This area here is called the\n[50:43] hypothalamus. And it's a tiny structure\n[50:46] but within that structure contains a\n[50:48] nucleus. And that group of cells the\n[50:51] nucleus has a fancy term and it's called\n[50:53] the supraismatic nucleus. But the\n[50:56] superismatic nucleus is your master\n[50:59] 24-hour clock. Every cell in your body\n[51:03] has a clock inside of it. But this is\n[51:06] the master clock. It's like Lord of the\n[51:09] Rings. There's one ring to rule them\n[51:10] all. Well, there's one clock to rule\n[51:12] them all. And here in the super\n[51:15] chaismatic nucleus, you get the 24-hour\n[51:18] rhythm of being awake and being asleep,\n[51:20] being awake and being asleep. How does\n[51:22] your brain keep quartzlike precision\n[51:26] 24-hour clock time? How does it do that?\n[51:30] The way it does that is that it uses\n[51:32] signals such as light and dark\n[51:35] >> from your eyes\n[51:36] >> from your eye. And so when light comes\n[51:39] through the retina, it tells the\n[51:42] hypothalamus it's daytime and therefore\n[51:45] you should be awake. And its rhythm\n[51:47] starts its awesome sort of upswing. And\n[51:49] temperature can do this and feeding can\n[51:51] do this all sorts of different things.\n[51:52] But for the most part, light is the\n[51:55] principal governor that essentially acts\n[51:58] like electrical, I should say, photon\n[52:00] fingers that pops the wristwatch dial\n[52:02] out and resets it precisely. So, 24\n[52:05] hours every single day. Because if\n[52:07] you're left in the dark with no signals\n[52:09] of light, your clock isn't precise. It\n[52:12] drifts to about 24 hours and 15 minutes.\n[52:15] So, you start going forward a little bit\n[52:16] every single day if you go into a cave.\n[52:18] And people have done this experiment.\n[52:20] The thing that keeps it precise is\n[52:21] light. So, you need light to keep a\n[52:25] beautiful 24-hour rhythm. One of those\n[52:28] things that's under the control of your\n[52:29] 24-hour rhythm is your sleep wake cycle.\n[52:32] >> What if I'm doing exercise?\n[52:34] >> Exercise is a wonderful entrainer of\n[52:37] your circadian rhythm as long as you're\n[52:39] doing it at the right time. So, if\n[52:41] you're starting to exercise at 3:00 or 4\n[52:44] in the morning, that's not good because\n[52:46] that's an activity signal that's going\n[52:48] to confuse the brain into thinking it's\n[52:50] the active period, which is normally\n[52:52] because we're a dional species, the day.\n[52:54] And it's the same thing coming back to\n[52:56] my point of regularity.\n[52:59] Using light as the best way to help with\n[53:02] that regularity because light if it's\n[53:05] artificial at night fools your brain\n[53:07] into thinking that it's daytime still\n[53:10] outside.\n[53:11] >> I mean is there any such thing as\n[53:12] non-artificial light? I mean I mean I\n[53:14] guess with the sun but I mean is there a\n[53:15] type of light that I could use at night\n[53:17] like candles or something or\n[53:19] >> Yes. below 30 lux,\n[53:22] >> right,\n[53:22] >> is not going to necessarily do you a\n[53:24] disservice. Probably below 50 lux. Now,\n[53:26] lux lux is just a measure of light\n[53:29] intensity. And you can download on the\n[53:31] app store a free looks meter. And if\n[53:33] you're an idiot nerd like me, you're\n[53:35] going all over the house at night and\n[53:37] you're sort of putting it in different\n[53:38] location, you're seeing any kind of\n[53:41] white spots here where you know the\n[53:42] looks is too high, but you need to drop\n[53:45] that that looks. By the way, it's a\n[53:47] great way if people want to say, \"Look,\n[53:49] my REM sleep is deficient. How can I get\n[53:51] more REM sleep?\" There's a great study\n[53:53] where they did something similar to what\n[53:54] I'm telling you now. 90 minutes before\n[53:57] bed, they turned down the lights to\n[54:00] below 30 lux, and they pulled out all of\n[54:03] the blue light. And just that trick of\n[54:06] dropping the lights down 90 minutes\n[54:08] before bed, below 30 lux, making it warm\n[54:12] yellow light, increased their REM sleep\n[54:14] by 18%. Wow,\n[54:16] >> it's a huge margin. So, no need for\n[54:18] pharmarmacology. But to your question,\n[54:20] why is regularity\n[54:24] important? Well, I told you that light\n[54:25] is one of the signals that can create\n[54:28] regularity. It turns out that your\n[54:30] behavior is another thing that will tell\n[54:34] your brain. So, meaning when you go to\n[54:37] bed and wake up at the same time, it\n[54:40] acts like an anchor. It anchors your\n[54:42] circadian rhythm and it tells you almost\n[54:46] like a scene in a movie. This scene is\n[54:49] now complete. A new scene starts. This\n[54:51] scene is complete. A new scene starts.\n[54:53] So every time that you're going to bed\n[54:55] at the same time and waking up at the\n[54:57] same time, you are feeding the super\n[54:59] chaismatic nucleus, the master 24-hour\n[55:01] clock in your brain, you're feeding it\n[55:03] signals of regularity.\n[55:06] And when it feeds on signals of\n[55:08] regularity, it improves the quantity and\n[55:12] the quality of your sleep. Your\n[55:15] circadian rhythm likes consistency. It\n[55:18] likes regular signals. When you feed it\n[55:20] signals of light, of activity, of waking\n[55:23] up, going to bed, you improve the\n[55:25] quantity and the quality of your sleep.\n[55:28] That's the reason behind the underlying\n[55:30] rule. So having a TV in your bedroom is\n[55:32] a terrible idea then because if on that\n[55:35] behavioral point if I'm getting in bed\n[55:36] but then I'm staying up for 3 hours\n[55:38] watching Netflix my brain is going to be\n[55:41] quite confused about like the behavioral\n[55:43] pattern of what what I'm doing in my\n[55:44] life. It's not going to associate the\n[55:46] bed with sleep. It's going to associate\n[55:48] the bed with movies.\n[55:49] >> That's one of the problems that we call\n[55:51] con it's called conditioned arousal\n[55:53] which sounds a lot more salacious than\n[55:55] it actually is. It's a term that we use\n[55:57] in sleep medicine which may explain\n[56:01] insomnia. So with insomnia, let's say\n[56:04] that the first time you go to this thing\n[56:05] called a dentist and you get in the\n[56:07] chair and it's kind of cool. You're\n[56:08] reclined back and you know you think\n[56:10] this is fine. But then after about 14 or\n[56:14] 15 visits when you get into that chair\n[56:17] you are no longer looking forward to\n[56:19] getting into that chair, are you? Why?\n[56:21] because you've learned the association\n[56:23] that being in that chair typically leads\n[56:25] to a bad outcome.\n[56:27] Now, the same thing is true with the\n[56:31] bed. If you start associating the bed\n[56:33] with anything other than sleep, and we\n[56:35] give you a pass in terms of sex, but\n[56:38] sleep and sex, anything other than that,\n[56:40] you start to learn that this thing\n[56:42] called my bed is this place where I'm\n[56:45] awake, where I work, where I eat, where\n[56:48] we have conversations, where I watch\n[56:50] television. And so, you know, if I were\n[56:52] to, and again, I'm stealing Michael\n[56:54] Grand's point, but if I were to say to\n[56:56] you, bed sleep, bed sleep, bed sleep,\n[56:59] bed sleep, bed sleep.\n[57:01] >> Okay. If I were to say bed, scroll, bed,\n[57:04] eat, bed, work, bed, sleep, bed, TV,\n[57:07] bed,\n[57:10] >> you\n[57:11] >> confused.\n[57:12] >> Yeah.\n[57:12] >> Because there's no predictive signal.\n[57:14] You've never bound an association. Now\n[57:16] the way this works to your disadvantage\n[57:19] in insomnia is the following. The\n[57:23] insomnia event that begins the insomnia\n[57:25] is typically not the thing that\n[57:27] maintains the insomnia. So let's say\n[57:28] that I um had I experienced a really\n[57:32] difficult bereavement and that triggered\n[57:35] a form of insomnia where I couldn't\n[57:37] sleep because of the bereavement.\n[57:39] Gradually the bereavement is not the\n[57:42] thing that's going to maintain my\n[57:44] insomnia. It's because every time I have\n[57:47] been going to bed over the past month, I\n[57:50] have not been sleeping. I've been wide\n[57:53] awake in my bed. So now, because your\n[57:55] brain is such an incredibly associative\n[57:57] device, it learns the association that\n[57:59] my bed is the place where I'm always\n[58:01] awake. And what do we then do? We need\n[58:04] to break that association in insomnia.\n[58:06] So what we do is we say the 20-minut\n[58:08] rule. If you've been in bed for about 20\n[58:10] minutes and it's just not happening for\n[58:12] you, don't worry. Don't listen to idiots\n[58:14] like me that doom and gloom and disease\n[58:15] and sickness and one bad night is not\n[58:18] going to be a problem. It's just not. So\n[58:20] just say look tonight is not my night. I\n[58:22] am not however going to lie in bed awake\n[58:26] because very quickly my brain starts to\n[58:28] learn the association that my bed is the\n[58:30] place where I'm wide awake. And you need\n[58:32] to break that association. So go to a\n[58:33] different room in dim light. Just read a\n[58:36] book, listen to a podcast, whatever it\n[58:38] is. And the rule of thumb is the\n[58:40] following. only return to bed when you\n[58:42] are sleepy and so there's no time limit\n[58:45] and that way you gradually relearn the\n[58:47] association that my bed is the place\n[58:49] where I always get consistent sleep\n[58:52] because otherwise it's the dentist chair\n[58:54] you walk into your bedroom and you look\n[58:57] at your bed and it's your nemesis and\n[58:59] you convinced yourself even before you\n[59:01] get into bed I'm not going to sleep\n[59:02] because that's the place where I always\n[59:04] don't sleep and by the way if you suffer\n[59:07] from the 3M awakenings my first question\n[59:09] is how do you know It's 3:00 a.m.\n[59:12] And that's your first problem. Looking\n[59:14] at the clock does two things. It makes\n[59:17] you more anxious.\n[59:18] >> Yeah.\n[59:19] >> And second, because your brain is such\n[59:21] an incredibly associative device, you\n[59:23] start to then decide that 3:00 a.m. is\n[59:26] the time when I need to wake up. If you\n[59:29] keep looking at the clock, you keep\n[59:31] reinforcing that it's 3:00 or 4. And\n[59:34] sleep at 3:00 in the morning is like\n[59:35] trying to remember someone's name. The\n[59:37] harder you try, the further you push\n[59:40] sleep away. Sleep is something that\n[59:42] happens to you. It's not something that\n[59:44] you make happen. And so at that moment,\n[59:48] the best advice if you don't want to get\n[59:50] out of bed is do any one of the\n[59:52] following. Meditation. Just do a guided\n[59:55] meditation. You can download apps. Next,\n[59:57] if that's not your thing, that's okay.\n[59:59] Do box breathing. You know, you can sort\n[01:00:01] of inhale for five, hold for six, exhale\n[01:00:06] for seven. There's all sorts of\n[01:00:07] different numbers, but you can do\n[01:00:09] breathing exercises. The third, if you\n[01:00:10] don't like that, is a body scan. So,\n[01:00:13] close your eyes, start at the top of\n[01:00:14] your head, feel as you know, do I have\n[01:00:16] tension in my forehead? Do I need to\n[01:00:17] relax it? What about my neck? Do I need\n[01:00:19] to move through your body and gradually\n[01:00:21] go down? How are my shoulder blades\n[01:00:23] feeling? I just relax down into the bed\n[01:00:25] and gradually down into the chest, into\n[01:00:28] the move through just relax. If none of\n[01:00:32] those things feel fun, the next thing\n[01:00:34] you can do is take yourself on a mental\n[01:00:35] walk. There's a great study from my\n[01:00:37] university, uh, the University of\n[01:00:39] Berkeley, California,\n[01:00:41] and we didn't do the study. Allison\n[01:00:43] Harvey did it. By the way, counting\n[01:00:44] sheep, bad idea. Makes your sleep worse,\n[01:00:48] it turns out. Why is that? Because,\n[01:00:50] well, with every kind of little bleeting\n[01:00:52] cotton wool ball with a strange look on\n[01:00:54] its face that leaps over the fence that\n[01:00:56] you're counting, you're reinforcing\n[01:00:59] every minute of sleep that you're not\n[01:01:01] getting, and it seems to make matters\n[01:01:02] worse. But what she found was that\n[01:01:04] there's an alternative. If you think\n[01:01:06] about a walk that you know in great\n[01:01:08] vivid detail. So for me, it's going to\n[01:01:10] be walking the dog. So I go over to the\n[01:01:13] shelf. I open the door. Is it the red\n[01:01:14] lead or the I'm going to go with the\n[01:01:16] blue lead today. So I clip the dog in\n[01:01:18] with my right hand. I open the door with\n[01:01:19] my left hand. I take a left down the\n[01:01:20] stairs. I look. It's that level of I\n[01:01:23] want you 4K detail in terms of\n[01:01:26] granularity.\n[01:01:27] And what's common about every method\n[01:01:29] I've just described, meditation, box\n[01:01:32] breathing, sort of uh body scan, going\n[01:01:36] on a mental walk, all of these things\n[01:01:38] have in common that you get your mind\n[01:01:41] off itself.\n[01:01:43] >> In that particular example where she\n[01:01:45] asks you to vividly think about a\n[01:01:47] journey that you know, what did she find\n[01:01:49] in the study? What she found is that\n[01:01:51] that increases the speed with which you\n[01:01:53] fall back asleep\n[01:01:55] >> significantly\n[01:01:57] because as I said it it's so you know\n[01:02:00] her work to me demonstrated that it it\n[01:02:03] is so like that name because the moment\n[01:02:06] I stop trying to remember someone's name\n[01:02:09] what happens\n[01:02:11] >> you remember it\n[01:02:12] >> I remember it and so when you do these\n[01:02:14] types of exercises where you're getting\n[01:02:15] the mind off itself the next thing that\n[01:02:18] you typically remember is your alarm\n[01:02:21] clock going off in the morning.\n[01:02:23] >> Is this why people listen to very vivid\n[01:02:26] sleep stories and why I listen to serial\n[01:02:29] killer documentaries?\n[01:02:32] >> Serial killer documentaries,\n[01:02:34] >> true crime documentaries, I should say.\n[01:02:35] That's a bit more uh nice to pallet.\n[01:02:39] >> I don't know of them. My suspicion is\n[01:02:42] that they may be doing your deep sleep a\n[01:02:44] disservice. anything\n[01:02:45] >> stick up for me in the comments. If you\n[01:02:48] if you listen to true crime to fall\n[01:02:50] asleep, please write it below in the\n[01:02:52] comment section.\n[01:02:52] >> If you find it subjectively wonderfully\n[01:02:56] pacifying and calming and there is not\n[01:02:59] death, naming, blood, and limbs being\n[01:03:03] distributed at high velocity all over\n[01:03:05] the scene, I would say it's great. But\n[01:03:08] if it looks like a Quentyn Tarantino\n[01:03:09] movie or sounds like one, maybe harm and\n[01:03:12] foul rather than\n[01:03:14] >> I mean just in my ears\n[01:03:15] >> but yes. So you know we forget that to\n[01:03:19] the best of my knowledge the meditation\n[01:03:22] company called calm now I have no\n[01:03:24] affiliation with them they were doing\n[01:03:26] somewhat well but what they realized is\n[01:03:28] that they wanted people to sort of\n[01:03:29] meditate in the morning and when they\n[01:03:30] used looked at their usage statistics\n[01:03:32] people were meditating in the morning\n[01:03:33] but then there was a huge swath of usage\n[01:03:36] right before bed people were\n[01:03:38] self-medicating their state of insomnia\n[01:03:40] and then through a stroke of genius they\n[01:03:42] realized when we were young we used to\n[01:03:45] love falling asleep to our parents\n[01:03:47] reading us a story.\n[01:03:50] Why is that any different when we become\n[01:03:51] adults? So they created sleep stories\n[01:03:54] and they went from struggling as a\n[01:03:57] company I think to becoming the first or\n[01:03:59] one of the first billion dollar\n[01:04:00] valuation health companies out there.\n[01:04:03] they became a unicorn and now they can\n[01:04:05] they've got you know people like you\n[01:04:07] know Matthew McConnA they've got Harry\n[01:04:09] Styles and then occasionally they've got\n[01:04:11] a a you know an unfortunate British\n[01:04:13] sleep scientist um with a bad voice but\n[01:04:16] you can listen to these sleep stories\n[01:04:18] and they are wonderfully soporific. Why?\n[01:04:20] Because they get your mind off itself.\n[01:04:22] >> We we talked um earlier on about\n[01:04:24] melatonin and uh there are other\n[01:04:27] supplements which people talk a lot\n[01:04:28] about. One of the ones that's become\n[01:04:29] really popular is magnesium. I've heard\n[01:04:32] ashwagandha and I've heard magnesium a\n[01:04:34] lot.\n[01:04:35] >> Yeah.\n[01:04:35] >> Is there any efficacy to these? Are\n[01:04:37] these are these useful?\n[01:04:38] >> The first thing I would say is that if\n[01:04:40] you're suffering from sleep problems and\n[01:04:42] you're looking to supplements, you're\n[01:04:44] stepping over dollars to pick up\n[01:04:46] pennies.\n[01:04:46] >> Okay.\n[01:04:47] >> What you need to do is think about the\n[01:04:49] fundamentals.\n[01:04:51] Regularity.\n[01:04:52] Watch your caffeine intake. Make sure\n[01:04:54] you're not drinking too much alcohol.\n[01:04:56] Get regular. Dim down half of the\n[01:04:59] lights. Digital detox. Any one of those,\n[01:05:01] but especially all of them combined are\n[01:05:03] going to get you log orders of better\n[01:05:05] sleep than reaching for the latest\n[01:05:09] supplement bottle of whatever it is. The\n[01:05:12] second thing to say is think about it\n[01:05:14] from a logical standpoint. If there were\n[01:05:16] really some supplement that promises to\n[01:05:19] be the Shangrilar of all respplendant\n[01:05:21] sleep at night, the drug companies would\n[01:05:24] have been all over it decades ago. To\n[01:05:27] put it in context, it took George Lucas,\n[01:05:29] I think, about 30 years to amass\n[01:05:31] something like 4 billion in revenue from\n[01:05:33] the Star Wars franchise. It took Ambient\n[01:05:35] 22 months.\n[01:05:38] That's how big a business sleep farmer\n[01:05:40] is.\n[01:05:41] >> Ambience is what a sleep pill.\n[01:05:42] >> Ambient is a sleep pill. Magnesium, if\n[01:05:45] you dig into it, and I I did a deep dive\n[01:05:47] about three years ago because I I kept\n[01:05:49] hearing it too. This magnesium,\n[01:05:51] magnesium. The first thing to note is\n[01:05:52] that most forms of magnesium, magnesium\n[01:05:55] oxide\n[01:05:56] or magnesium citrate, most of these\n[01:05:59] forms of magnesium\n[01:06:01] don't cross the brain barrier and sleep\n[01:06:04] is produced by your brain. So, how can\n[01:06:07] something that doesn't get into your\n[01:06:09] brain affect\n[01:06:12] brain process? Number one, there is one\n[01:06:14] form of magnesium that seems to have\n[01:06:16] some evidence in favor of it. It's\n[01:06:17] called magnesium L308.\n[01:06:21] But if you look at the literature, where\n[01:06:22] did this story come from? It turns out\n[01:06:24] that about 30 years ago, they started\n[01:06:27] looking at people who had disrupted\n[01:06:28] sleep and they would assess their blood\n[01:06:30] work. And what they found is that some\n[01:06:32] of those people were magnesium\n[01:06:34] deficient. And when they supplemented\n[01:06:36] them with magnesium and they became\n[01:06:38] magnesium normative, their sleep got\n[01:06:41] better.\n[01:06:42] But that's very different than saying,\n[01:06:44] \"Look, you and I, we're currently\n[01:06:46] magnesium normative and then dosing\n[01:06:50] myself with high volumes of magnesium.\n[01:06:53] Am I imagining that that's going to make\n[01:06:54] my sleep better?\" The the analogy would\n[01:06:56] be, let's say I develop this incredible\n[01:06:58] new oxygen saturation machine, and you\n[01:07:02] say to me, \"Well, but Matt, my blood\n[01:07:03] oxygen saturation right now, looking at\n[01:07:05] my device, tells me it's 98.6%.\"\n[01:07:10] It doesn't matter how fancy or good my\n[01:07:12] machine is. I'm not going to get you\n[01:07:14] past 100%. You're already at ceiling\n[01:07:16] level.\n[01:07:17] >> And that's the problem with magnesium\n[01:07:19] supplementation. If you're magnesium\n[01:07:21] normative, all you're doing is creating\n[01:07:23] probably expensive urine at at at that\n[01:07:25] moment in time. Now, there may be an\n[01:07:28] indirect benefit of magnesium in that it\n[01:07:31] does seem to relax muscles. And when the\n[01:07:34] body is in a state of relaxation, it\n[01:07:37] sends a signal of relaxation back up a\n[01:07:40] branch of nerves called the vagus nerve\n[01:07:42] that goes up to the brain and signals to\n[01:07:45] your brain you're starting to relax down\n[01:07:47] and you get this state of quiescence and\n[01:07:50] that's very helpful for sleep. So\n[01:07:52] magnesium may still have an indirect\n[01:07:54] benefit on sleep through its relaxation\n[01:07:56] kind of policy that it instantiates in\n[01:07:59] the body. But overall, magnesium is not\n[01:08:03] really moving the needle if you look at\n[01:08:04] the studies. Ashwagandha\n[01:08:08] is different. Ashwagandha and another\n[01:08:10] compound called phospatitile serarene.\n[01:08:14] Phospatidile sererearine and ashwagandha\n[01:08:17] both of these supplements seem to help\n[01:08:20] do one of two things. They either\n[01:08:22] ratchet down the fightor-flight branch\n[01:08:24] of your nervous system and they can also\n[01:08:27] reduce the amount of cortisol that the\n[01:08:30] body is releasing. That's important\n[01:08:33] because I see a lot of people coming to\n[01:08:35] the sleep center where I'm at and they\n[01:08:37] have what I call the tired but wired\n[01:08:39] phenomenon where they come to me and\n[01:08:41] they say, \"I am so tired. I am so so\n[01:08:44] tired but I'm just so wired emotionally\n[01:08:47] and from a nervous perspective that I\n[01:08:49] can't fall asleep.\" And let's say that\n[01:08:51] you've done, let's say, you know, um, an\n[01:08:53] onstage event and it's incredible.\n[01:08:55] You've got that onstage buzz. You come\n[01:08:57] off stage at 11 p.m. And normally you'd\n[01:08:59] be fast asleep, but you know, you are so\n[01:09:02] wired. It doesn't matter. You are tired,\n[01:09:05] as tired as can be, but you're so wired\n[01:09:07] you can't fall asleep. That's the fight\n[01:09:09] orflight branch being switched on and\n[01:09:11] you just can't fall asleep. You need to\n[01:09:12] push it back off. Phosphatidal sererine\n[01:09:15] and ashwagandha will both push you back\n[01:09:17] over into the more quuscent what we call\n[01:09:20] parasympathetic nervous system branch.\n[01:09:22] That's good. However, they also will\n[01:09:26] reduce cortisol and cortisol is a\n[01:09:28] wakeromoting hormone. Cortisol is fine.\n[01:09:31] We It gets a bad rap. You need to have\n[01:09:34] your cortisol start to spike a few hours\n[01:09:36] before bed and it helps with the waking\n[01:09:38] up process. It's wonderful. Every day we\n[01:09:42] have a cortisol spike that starts\n[01:09:44] happening before we wake up. It's one of\n[01:09:46] the things that helps us wake up and\n[01:09:48] then it builds us to this beautiful\n[01:09:50] crescendo midm morning where you should\n[01:09:52] be awake and not needing caffeine\n[01:09:55] >> and it drops before bed\n[01:09:57] >> and then it starts to peak in the sort\n[01:10:00] of middle early afternoon and in fact\n[01:10:02] usually peaks at the late morning hours\n[01:10:04] I should say and then it will start its\n[01:10:05] awesome sort of downswing and what you\n[01:10:08] see is that right before you go to bed\n[01:10:11] cortisol should hit its lowest point\n[01:10:13] what we call its nadia its lowest\n[01:10:16] trough.\n[01:10:16] >> Mhm.\n[01:10:17] >> What's interesting, by the way, just as\n[01:10:19] an aside, is that insomnia we can\n[01:10:22] classify usually as at least one of two\n[01:10:24] different types. There's actually\n[01:10:25] multiple, but let's just say there are\n[01:10:27] of those multiple, there are two types.\n[01:10:29] One is called sleep onset insomnia. I\n[01:10:32] can't fall asleep. The other is sleep\n[01:10:34] maintenance insomnia. I can't stay\n[01:10:36] asleep. when they've looked at people's\n[01:10:39] cortisol on a 30 minute by 30 minute\n[01:10:42] basis on the 24-hour clock face, we go\n[01:10:44] through just what we described. Just\n[01:10:46] before we wake up, we get this rise in\n[01:10:48] cortisol. It peaks late morning and then\n[01:10:51] it drops down and right before bed, our\n[01:10:53] cortisol is almost at its lowest point.\n[01:10:56] With insomnia patients, they show\n[01:10:58] exactly the same thing. A beautiful rise\n[01:11:01] in the late morning hours. It starts to\n[01:11:04] come down, but then you see two\n[01:11:06] anomalies. Right before bed, it goes\n[01:11:09] back up.\n[01:11:10] And then in the middle of the night,\n[01:11:13] even when it's starting to rise, it will\n[01:11:14] have this abnormal spike right in the\n[01:11:16] middle of the night, too. And what we\n[01:11:19] believe is that that may in part explain\n[01:11:21] sleep onset insomnia. Cortisol should be\n[01:11:24] coming down and it should stay low right\n[01:11:25] before we go to bed. But then it jumps\n[01:11:27] back up in insomnia patients. I can't\n[01:11:29] fall asleep. And then it continues to\n[01:11:32] stay low throughout the first half of\n[01:11:34] the night, but then it also spikes in\n[01:11:36] insomnia patients. I can't stay asleep.\n[01:11:39] >> I've had so many founders speak to me\n[01:11:41] and say, \"Why didn't this particular ad\n[01:11:43] that I ran on this platform work for me?\n[01:11:45] Maybe the copy wasn't good. The creative\n[01:11:47] wasn't strong.\" But usually the problem\n[01:11:48] is they're not having the right\n[01:11:49] conversation because that ad never\n[01:11:51] reached the right person. And if you're\n[01:11:53] in B2B marketing, that is much of the\n[01:11:55] game. And this is where LinkedIn ads\n[01:11:57] solves that problem for you. Their\n[01:11:59] targeting is ridiculously specific. You\n[01:12:01] can target by job title, seniority,\n[01:12:04] company size, industry, and even\n[01:12:06] someone's skill set. And their network\n[01:12:08] includes over a billion professionals.\n[01:12:10] About 130 million of them are decision\n[01:12:13] makers. So when you use LinkedIn ads,\n[01:12:15] you're putting your brand in front of\n[01:12:16] the right people. And LinkedIn ads also\n[01:12:18] drive the highest B2B return on ad spend\n[01:12:20] across all ad networks in my experience.\n[01:12:23] If you want to give them a try, head\n[01:12:25] over to linkedin.com/diary.\n[01:12:28] And when you spend $250 on your first\n[01:12:30] LinkedIn ads campaign, you'll get an\n[01:12:32] extra $250 credit from me for the next\n[01:12:36] one. That's linkedin.com/diary.\n[01:12:39] Terms and conditions apply. We were\n[01:12:41] talking about regularity, timing, and\n[01:12:43] all these things and quality and\n[01:12:44] quantity. But one of the things I\n[01:12:46] learned from your work is that that last\n[01:12:48] hour is potentially the most important\n[01:12:51] hour of me being in bed. And I I say\n[01:12:54] this in part because my my girlfriend,\n[01:12:55] she would wake, she'd have about six six\n[01:12:58] hours, six and a half hours sleep. She\n[01:12:59] sleeps very very well. Perfect sleeper,\n[01:13:01] but she'd always get up really really\n[01:13:02] really early. And in part that was\n[01:13:06] because of the guilt that I talked\n[01:13:07] about. But I had a conversation with her\n[01:13:08] about the guilt. And I said, \"Just stay\n[01:13:10] in bed as long as you need to stay in\n[01:13:11] bed. Like just have that extra eighth\n[01:13:13] hour.\" And in part that's because I\n[01:13:15] learned that the further we go in sleep,\n[01:13:18] the more REM we're getting.\n[01:13:20] >> Yeah.\n[01:13:21] >> Okay. Can you explain that to me with\n[01:13:22] these four blocks? Why that last hour is\n[01:13:25] particularly important and why we\n[01:13:26] shouldn't be jumping out of bed or why\n[01:13:28] we should be using certain sleep devices\n[01:13:30] to wake us up when we're at the end of\n[01:13:31] that last hour of REM.\n[01:13:33] >> Absolutely. So here we have the four\n[01:13:35] blocks of sleep. So when we first fall\n[01:13:39] asleep, we go into light non rapid eye\n[01:13:42] movement sleep. Stage one. This is the\n[01:13:44] stage of sleep that if I wake you up out\n[01:13:46] of it, you say, \"I wasn't sleeping.\" Now\n[01:13:50] you it's just that you're just in that\n[01:13:52] transitional phase, this beautiful\n[01:13:54] liinal state between the windows of\n[01:13:56] wakefulness and true sleep. So this is\n[01:13:59] your bridge between the waking world and\n[01:14:01] the sleep world. And it doesn't last for\n[01:14:03] very long. Maybe just 10 or 15 minutes\n[01:14:05] at tops. Then you get into the workhorse\n[01:14:08] of sleep. This is stage two nonREM\n[01:14:10] sleep. 50% of your night is spent in\n[01:14:14] stage two nonREM sleep. I don't like the\n[01:14:16] word light nonREM sleep. I've often used\n[01:14:19] it, but it's not really it's we do a lot\n[01:14:22] of cognitive processing in stage two\n[01:14:23] nonREM sleep. It's good stuff. It's not\n[01:14:26] just the stage that you have to go\n[01:14:27] through from sort of, you know, deep\n[01:14:30] non-REM sleep to go back to stage two in\n[01:14:32] order for you to get to REM, but I'll\n[01:14:34] come to that. So, we have fallen asleep\n[01:14:37] 10 minutes.\n[01:14:38] >> Yeah.\n[01:14:39] >> Now, we're in stage two nonREM sleep.\n[01:14:41] We'll stay there for about 15 or 20\n[01:14:43] minutes. Then if it's in the first\n[01:14:45] couple of hours of the night, we go down\n[01:14:47] into the very deepest stages of deep\n[01:14:49] non-REM sleep. This is where the brain\n[01:14:52] wave patterns slow down. But the brain\n[01:14:55] waves become incredibly big, huge, big,\n[01:14:58] powerful, slow brain waves. This is\n[01:15:01] where you get an enormous amount of\n[01:15:03] restoration, recovery of many of your\n[01:15:05] major physiological systems.\n[01:15:08] >> So physical recovery,\n[01:15:09] >> physical recovery, but mental too. Yeah,\n[01:15:12] >> it's during deep sleep that you take\n[01:15:14] newly minted memories that you've\n[01:15:16] learned and you hit the save button on\n[01:15:18] those memories so that you don't forget.\n[01:15:20] >> Deep sleep essentially is going to\n[01:15:23] futureproof the information that you\n[01:15:25] just learned today. It transfers\n[01:15:28] information from a short-term storage\n[01:15:31] vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent\n[01:15:33] long-term storage site. It's during deep\n[01:15:36] non-REM sleep when we have this\n[01:15:37] communication. So think of those deep\n[01:15:40] powerful slow brain waves like longwave\n[01:15:42] radio station when you used to tune into\n[01:15:44] a radio station in a car. You get huge\n[01:15:47] ability for information transfer across\n[01:15:50] long distances across huge paths in the\n[01:15:53] brain. It's amazing. So we've gone from\n[01:15:56] light non-REM, then we go down into deep\n[01:15:58] nonrem. We'll stay there for about 15 or\n[01:16:00] 20 minutes. Then we'll start to rise\n[01:16:02] back up again. We'll go back into stage\n[01:16:04] two nonREM sleep.\n[01:16:06] >> Wait, we've gone from 1 2 3 to two. Yes.\n[01:16:09] So, we've gone, think about it more\n[01:16:13] almost like a roller coaster, right? So,\n[01:16:15] we go from light nonrem and then we go\n[01:16:17] down into stage two nonREM. Then, we go\n[01:16:20] down into deep sleep and then we're\n[01:16:22] going to rise back up into light stage\n[01:16:25] two nonREM sleep. We're going to stay\n[01:16:27] there and after about 70 80 minutes,\n[01:16:30] you're going to pop up and you'll have a\n[01:16:33] short REM sleep period.\n[01:16:34] >> Oh, okay. Like this.\n[01:16:35] >> And this is beautiful. So this is what\n[01:16:38] we call a hypnogog.\n[01:16:39] >> I'll put this on the screen for anyone.\n[01:16:41] >> Lovely. So what I'm describing here is\n[01:16:43] this roller coaster ride. So we've\n[01:16:45] fallen asleep light stage one nonREM go\n[01:16:47] down into stage two. Then you go down\n[01:16:50] and you have a heavy period of deep\n[01:16:52] nonREM slowwave sleep. Stage three. And\n[01:16:55] then and that's what you see on your\n[01:16:57] sleep tracker is deep sleep. This is\n[01:16:58] light sleep. This is deep sleep. Stage\n[01:17:00] two nonREM sleep. Light sleep. Stage\n[01:17:03] three nonREM sleep. Deep sleep. But then\n[01:17:06] you'll start to climb back up and then\n[01:17:08] you may pop up and you'll have a short\n[01:17:10] REM sleep period here after about 70 or\n[01:17:12] 80 minutes. So you'll have about 10\n[01:17:13] minutes of REM sleep and then back down\n[01:17:16] you go again. You go down into non-REM\n[01:17:19] sleep and then up into REM. Down into\n[01:17:21] nonREM sleep and you'll go up into REM.\n[01:17:23] Down into nonREM sleep and up into REM.\n[01:17:26] So what's interesting however is that\n[01:17:29] the ratio of nonREM to REM changes. Now,\n[01:17:33] there's a myth out there and it's a bit\n[01:17:35] of a problem. We humans have a 90inute\n[01:17:40] average nonREM to REM cycle. So, we go\n[01:17:42] down into nonREM sleep and then up into\n[01:17:44] REM sleep every 90 minutes. Then, we go\n[01:17:47] back down into nonREM sleep and then up\n[01:17:48] into REM sleep. So, we go down into\n[01:17:50] nonREM sleep and then up into REM in\n[01:17:52] this 90minut cycle.\n[01:17:55] The problem is that it's on average 90\n[01:17:58] minutes. It ranges from 70 minutes to to\n[01:18:01] 120 minutes from one individual to the\n[01:18:03] next. So you know these devices that you\n[01:18:05] may have seen tried to sort of you know\n[01:18:07] entrepreneurship they say I'm going to\n[01:18:10] wake you up at the ideal moment in your\n[01:18:13] 90minute cycle so that this thing that\n[01:18:15] sits on my bedside I tap it when I'm the\n[01:18:17] lights go out and then it's going to go\n[01:18:19] on its 90minut cycle and it's going to\n[01:18:20] figure out the perfect moment to wake\n[01:18:22] you up. It's nonsense because my sleep\n[01:18:26] cycle may be 75 minutes. Yours may be\n[01:18:28] 105 minutes. It's got no idea because\n[01:18:30] it's using a hard-coded 90minute cycle.\n[01:18:33] It's it's in some ways nonsense. But we\n[01:18:36] go down into nonREM sleep and up into\n[01:18:38] REM sleep every 90 minutes. What changes\n[01:18:40] however is the ratio of non-REM to REM\n[01:18:44] within those 90inut cycles as you move\n[01:18:47] across the night such that in the first\n[01:18:49] half of the night the majority of those\n[01:18:51] 90-minute cycles are comprised of lots\n[01:18:53] of deep non-REM sleep and very little\n[01:18:56] REM sleep. But as you push through to\n[01:18:59] the second half of the night, now that\n[01:19:00] seesaw balance shifts over and you spend\n[01:19:04] much more of your time in REM sleep in\n[01:19:06] the second half of the night and\n[01:19:07] particularly just as you said in the\n[01:19:09] last 2 hours of the night. Why is this\n[01:19:12] consequential? Well, just as you said\n[01:19:13] and you spoke about for your girlfriend,\n[01:19:15] let's say that you know I normally go to\n[01:19:17] bed for argument sake and I'm not saying\n[01:19:19] this is the ideal time, but I go to bed\n[01:19:20] at midnight to make the math easy and I\n[01:19:22] wake up at 8:00. But tomorrow I've got\n[01:19:24] to catch my flight back home. So, I'm\n[01:19:27] going to wake up two hours early. So,\n[01:19:29] I'm going to wake up at 6 rather than 8.\n[01:19:31] I've lost two hours of sleep. So, how\n[01:19:33] much total sleep have I lost? Well, I've\n[01:19:34] lost 25% of my total sleep. 2 hours of\n[01:19:37] my 8 hours. 25%. Well, yes and no. I've\n[01:19:41] lost 25% of my total sleep, but I may\n[01:19:45] have lost 50 60 70% of all of my REM\n[01:19:49] sleep. Why? Because REM sleep comes in\n[01:19:51] the second half of them, particularly\n[01:19:52] those last couple of hours of sleep. So\n[01:19:54] that's why it's not just academic that\n[01:19:56] you understand the sleep cycle\n[01:19:57] relationship, but it's also pragmatic\n[01:20:00] because it can impact the amount. In\n[01:20:02] fact, the easiest way if people said,\n[01:20:03] \"How can I get more REM sleep?\" I would\n[01:20:06] say just sleep 15 minutes later into the\n[01:20:09] day than you normally would do and you\n[01:20:11] will disproportionately bias yourself\n[01:20:14] towards getting significantly more REM\n[01:20:16] sleep.\n[01:20:17] >> And why does REM sleep matter?\n[01:20:19] REM sleep is a brain state firstly that\n[01:20:21] is incredibly active in some in fact\n[01:20:23] some parts of the brain particularly if\n[01:20:25] I were to show you these deep emotional\n[01:20:28] centers of the brain as I pull this\n[01:20:30] brain apart.\n[01:20:32] So we've got these sort of deep\n[01:20:34] emotional centers in the brain that sit\n[01:20:37] and in fact the sort of they're more\n[01:20:38] just underneath in here tucked in inside\n[01:20:41] just next to your brain stem at the top\n[01:20:43] of it. And these emotional centers are\n[01:20:46] called the amygdala. And you have one on\n[01:20:48] the left and one on the right side of\n[01:20:49] your brain. That part of the brain\n[01:20:51] together with a memory structure that\n[01:20:53] runs alongside it called the\n[01:20:54] hippocampus. Those two parts of the\n[01:20:56] brain form what we call the limbic\n[01:20:58] system. And you may have heard of the\n[01:20:59] limbic system, the emotional centers of\n[01:21:01] the brain. Those can be up to 40% more\n[01:21:04] active when you're in dream sleep than\n[01:21:06] when you're awake.\n[01:21:07] >> Dream sleep.\n[01:21:08] >> Dream sleep is rapid eye movement sleep.\n[01:21:10] >> REM sleep.\n[01:21:11] >> So REM sleep is the stage. Now it\n[01:21:13] depends on how you define dreaming. If\n[01:21:15] you define dreaming as any mental\n[01:21:17] activity reported upon awakening, then\n[01:21:19] you dream in all stages of sleep. Light\n[01:21:21] non-REM sleep, deep REM sleep. So what\n[01:21:22] would what would that sound like? Well,\n[01:21:24] if I woke you up and said, Stephen, just\n[01:21:26] tell me what was going through your head\n[01:21:27] and you said, \"Well, I was just thinking\n[01:21:28] about the next time you're going to come\n[01:21:30] in and wake me up.\" That's just a dream\n[01:21:32] thought. What the most people think of\n[01:21:35] dreams as the dreams that we have from\n[01:21:38] REM sleep, from rapid eye movement\n[01:21:40] sleep. That's why we call it dream\n[01:21:41] sleep. Dreams from rapid eye movement\n[01:21:43] sleep are flid the narrative. In fact,\n[01:21:47] last night when you fell asleep and you\n[01:21:49] went into dream sleep, you became\n[01:21:52] incredibly psychotic.\n[01:21:54] >> Excuse me.\n[01:21:55] >> Now, before you reject my diagnosis of\n[01:21:57] your nighttime psychosis, let me give\n[01:21:59] you five good reasons. When you went\n[01:22:01] into dream sleep last night, you started\n[01:22:03] to see things which were not there. So,\n[01:22:05] you were hallucinating. Second, you\n[01:22:07] believe things that couldn't possibly be\n[01:22:09] true. So you were delusional. Third, you\n[01:22:12] became confused about time, place, and\n[01:22:15] person. So in psychiatry, we call that\n[01:22:17] being disorientated.\n[01:22:20] Fourth, you had wildly fluctuating\n[01:22:22] emotions. Something that we call being\n[01:22:24] emotionally labile. You're all over the\n[01:22:27] place. And then how wonderful, you and\n[01:22:29] I, cuz I'll include myself now as being\n[01:22:31] psychotic. You and I, we both woke up\n[01:22:34] this morning and we forgot most if not\n[01:22:36] all of that dream experience. So, we're\n[01:22:37] suffering from amnesia. If you were to\n[01:22:40] experience any one of those five\n[01:22:41] symptoms whilst you're awake, you'd be\n[01:22:43] seeking some degree of psychological\n[01:22:45] help. But for reasons that we're only\n[01:22:47] now understanding, it seems to be a\n[01:22:48] normal biological and psychological\n[01:22:50] process. So, what are the reasons? Why\n[01:22:53] do we dream? We dream for at least two\n[01:22:55] different reasons. The first reason is\n[01:22:58] emotional first aid.\n[01:23:01] REM sleep is what I've defined as\n[01:23:03] overnight therapy and it's during dream\n[01:23:06] sleep where your brain takes difficult\n[01:23:08] painful emotional experiences and it\n[01:23:11] acts like a nocturnal soothing balm and\n[01:23:13] it just takes the sharp edges off those\n[01:23:15] difficult painful experiences so that\n[01:23:18] you come back the next day and you have\n[01:23:20] a memory of an emotional event but it's\n[01:23:23] no longer emotional. you don't have that\n[01:23:25] same visceral regurgitation of of that\n[01:23:29] same emotional charge.\n[01:23:32] Why is REM sleep able to do this\n[01:23:34] overnight therapy, this deepotentiation?\n[01:23:37] Why is REM sleep able to sort of strip\n[01:23:39] the bitter emotional rind from\n[01:23:41] theformational orange as it were? The\n[01:23:44] reason is the following. Dream sleep,\n[01:23:47] REM sleep is the only time during the\n[01:23:50] 24-hour period where the brain shuts off\n[01:23:52] a stress related neurochemical called\n[01:23:55] noradrenaline.\n[01:23:56] Now, you've heard of the sister chemical\n[01:23:58] downstairs in your body called\n[01:24:00] adrenaline. Well, upstairs in the brain,\n[01:24:02] we don't have adrenaline. We have\n[01:24:03] noradrenaline. REM sleep is the only\n[01:24:05] time where it's completely shut off. And\n[01:24:09] what we put forward is a theory called\n[01:24:11] overnight therapy where your brain has,\n[01:24:14] as I told you, these emotional centers\n[01:24:16] and these memory centers. The emotional\n[01:24:18] centers, the amydala, the memory\n[01:24:19] centers, the hippocampus. You reactivate\n[01:24:22] those structures when you go into dream\n[01:24:24] sleep. So your brain gets the chance to\n[01:24:26] reactivate and replay and reprocess\n[01:24:29] emotional experiences. However, it's\n[01:24:32] doing it in a quote unquote safe\n[01:24:34] neurochemical environment because that\n[01:24:36] stress chemical of neuradrenaline is\n[01:24:38] completely shut off. So, it's the ideal\n[01:24:41] neurochemical therapy for stripping the\n[01:24:45] emotion from the memory. And we put\n[01:24:47] forward a theory that perhaps the\n[01:24:48] quintessential disorder where this fails\n[01:24:51] is PTSD.\n[01:24:53] Because when you speak to those\n[01:24:55] patients, not only do we see that their\n[01:24:56] REM sleep is disrupted,\n[01:24:59] when you speak to those patients, they\n[01:25:01] will say, \"Look, I just can't quote\n[01:25:02] unquote get over the event.\" What they\n[01:25:05] mean by that is the war veteran who is\n[01:25:08] now going to the supermarket and they\n[01:25:10] come outside and they're in the car park\n[01:25:13] and the car backfires and they instantly\n[01:25:15] have the flashback to the the sort of\n[01:25:18] detonation on the military field. And\n[01:25:21] what's happening there is that the brain\n[01:25:23] has not stripped the emotion from the\n[01:25:26] memory. So every time they relive the\n[01:25:28] memory, they regurgitate that same\n[01:25:30] emotional reaction.\n[01:25:32] >> So no wonder we proposed that the brain\n[01:25:34] then comes back the following night and\n[01:25:36] says, \"Look, I'm sorry, sleep. I've\n[01:25:39] still got this trauma memory. Can you do\n[01:25:41] your trick of stripping the emotion from\n[01:25:43] the memory?\" And it fails again. So the\n[01:25:46] next night it comes back and says, \"I'm\n[01:25:47] sorry to bother you, but I've still got\n[01:25:49] this emotionally charged memory. Please\n[01:25:51] do your trick of stripping the emotion\n[01:25:52] from memory.\" It fails again. This\n[01:25:55] sounds like the broken record of\n[01:25:57] repetitive nightmares that we see in\n[01:25:59] PTSD.\n[01:26:01] Why could this be happening? Levels of\n[01:26:03] noradrenaline in the brain in patients\n[01:26:06] with PTSD are too high. And I was at a\n[01:26:09] conference some years ago where I was\n[01:26:10] presenting this theory. We just\n[01:26:12] presented this theory. It was a theory\n[01:26:14] and it was in search of data. And it\n[01:26:16] turns out at the same conference, it was\n[01:26:18] one of those incredible moments. You get\n[01:26:19] hairs on the back of your neck. There\n[01:26:21] was a psychiatrist from Puget Sound,\n[01:26:23] which is just outside of Seattle on the\n[01:26:25] west coast of America. And he had been\n[01:26:28] treating his war veterans in the\n[01:26:30] Veterans Administration with a blood\n[01:26:32] pressure medication called Preszicin.\n[01:26:35] Now, it turns out that prescineric\n[01:26:38] drug because it's the Veterans\n[01:26:39] Administration, so it's cheap and it\n[01:26:41] crosses the bloodb brain barrier. When\n[01:26:44] prescin brain, one of the things that it\n[01:26:46] does is shut down levels of\n[01:26:49] noradrenaline. Why was this interesting?\n[01:26:52] What he was perplexed by is that he was\n[01:26:54] saying, \"I'm giving this blood pressure\n[01:26:55] medication to my war veterans with PTSD.\n[01:26:58] It's not helping too much with their\n[01:27:00] blood pressure, but they're all coming\n[01:27:01] back saying, \"All of those repetitive\n[01:27:03] nightmares, they're starting to go away\n[01:27:05] and I'm sleeping better and I'm feeling\n[01:27:07] better.\" What he had done was\n[01:27:10] inadvertently treated their high levels\n[01:27:13] of noradrenaline which were preventing\n[01:27:16] the brain from kind of stop dropping\n[01:27:19] those levels of noradrenaline down and\n[01:27:20] processing the emotion from the memory.\n[01:27:23] It was too high in those PTSD PTSD\n[01:27:25] patients. But by treating them with this\n[01:27:27] drug, he'd inadvertently brought the\n[01:27:29] levels of noradrenaline down during REM\n[01:27:31] sleep. And then it ultimately became one\n[01:27:34] of the only prescribed medications in\n[01:27:36] the Veterans Administration for\n[01:27:37] repetitive nightmares because why? The\n[01:27:41] brain had finally got down into a quote\n[01:27:43] unquote safe chemical state because\n[01:27:46] neuradrenaline was too high. But he\n[01:27:48] treated them with this drug. So he had\n[01:27:52] data that was in search of a theory. I\n[01:27:54] had a theory that was in search of\n[01:27:56] clinical data. And so I raced to him\n[01:27:59] after he gave us a presentation. I said,\n[01:28:01] \"I think I know why you're finding what\n[01:28:03] you're finding.\" I flew him down to\n[01:28:05] Berkeley. We spent all day together. We\n[01:28:07] went out for a dinner together. And as I\n[01:28:09] said, ultimately he went on to do\n[01:28:10] clinical trials. And it it's not a cure\n[01:28:12] all for everyone, by the way. It doesn't\n[01:28:14] work for everyone.\n[01:28:16] But and I would say that there is now a\n[01:28:18] better treatment for nightmares if\n[01:28:20] you're suffering from nightmares and\n[01:28:22] it's called image rehearsal therapy or\n[01:28:25] IRT\n[01:28:27] and it works through an incredible\n[01:28:29] mechanism of memory that we actually had\n[01:28:31] discovered about gosh 20 years ago now\n[01:28:33] called memory reconsolidation.\n[01:28:36] So when you learn information, it would\n[01:28:39] be or let's take a word document.\n[01:28:42] Wouldn't it be staffed if you opened up\n[01:28:44] a word document, you started typing in,\n[01:28:46] you know, all this information, you hit\n[01:28:48] save, and then you come back tomorrow\n[01:28:49] and you double click on the document and\n[01:28:52] word has shut you out, you can't edit\n[01:28:53] the document. That's a really bad\n[01:28:56] information storage system. It's a bad\n[01:28:58] idea. Your human memories are just like\n[01:29:00] this. You form new memories, then you\n[01:29:04] sleep, and you save them. But when you\n[01:29:06] come back and you reactivate that memory\n[01:29:09] when you recall a memory, you bring it\n[01:29:12] back into this opened up state, it's\n[01:29:14] like double clicking on the memory and\n[01:29:16] the memory becomes fragile and malleable\n[01:29:18] once again. So you can update and edit\n[01:29:21] that memory. And then the next night you\n[01:29:23] resave it. It's called reconsolidation.\n[01:29:25] So the first night I save it. That's\n[01:29:26] consolidation. Then I reactivate it. I\n[01:29:29] modify it and then the next night I\n[01:29:31] reconsolidate it. So coming back to\n[01:29:35] nightmares, it turns out that you can do\n[01:29:37] this with trauma patients who have\n[01:29:40] nightmares caused by trauma. For\n[01:29:41] example, let's say that you got into a\n[01:29:43] horrific road accident and you went\n[01:29:45] through your brakes failed, you went\n[01:29:47] through the red light, you got t-boned,\n[01:29:49] it was just traumatic, was all\n[01:29:51] traumatic.\n[01:29:53] And what you do with the therapist\n[01:29:54] because you're having these repetitive\n[01:29:56] nightmares of reliving that same car\n[01:29:59] crash every night, you work with them\n[01:30:02] and you tell them the dream. You recall\n[01:30:04] the dream actively out loud. But then\n[01:30:07] working with a therapist, what you do is\n[01:30:09] you modify the outcome. So instead of me\n[01:30:12] saying the brakes failed, now in the new\n[01:30:14] scenario with your therapist, you say,\n[01:30:16] \"Well, you look down and there's a\n[01:30:17] manual handbrake in the car.\" So you\n[01:30:20] realize that you can actually just\n[01:30:21] gradually start applying the handbrake\n[01:30:23] and you bring the car to a safe halt and\n[01:30:25] you go to the side of the road and\n[01:30:26] there's no accident. And what you're\n[01:30:29] doing is you're reopening back up that\n[01:30:31] trauma memory and you're rewriting the\n[01:30:34] narrative and then you sleep and you\n[01:30:37] update that memory. And by recalling and\n[01:30:41] rewriting the memory each and every\n[01:30:43] waking day, you end up dissipating the\n[01:30:46] severity of your trauma nightmare every\n[01:30:49] single night. And it's called image\n[01:30:51] rehearsal therapy for nightmares. It's\n[01:30:54] incredibly powerful. It's probably more\n[01:30:56] powerful than the presin drug that I\n[01:30:57] spoke about.\n[01:30:58] >> And I'm guessing people don't sleep and\n[01:31:01] also have nightmares for a variety of\n[01:31:03] reasons relating to trauma generally.\n[01:31:04] Ah, it's a good question perhaps which\n[01:31:07] is in some ways what's the difference\n[01:31:09] between a bad dream and a nightmare\n[01:31:12] >> because all of us will have bad dreams.\n[01:31:15] Bad dreams are usually things that\n[01:31:18] happen infrequently. Maybe you have them\n[01:31:19] once every month, every couple of\n[01:31:21] months.\n[01:31:21] >> Yeah.\n[01:31:22] >> The definition of nightmare disorder is\n[01:31:24] that you have to have these dreams\n[01:31:26] frequently, maybe at least twice a week.\n[01:31:28] They have to wake you up\n[01:31:31] out of your sleep and you have vivid\n[01:31:34] recall.\n[01:31:35] Plus, it has to cause you some kind of\n[01:31:38] daytime distress where you're not\n[01:31:40] feeling good about the day. It's causing\n[01:31:43] you mental anguish. And furthermore, if\n[01:31:46] it starts to lead to hopelessness or a\n[01:31:50] sense that your life is not worth\n[01:31:52] living, you absolutely need to go and\n[01:31:55] see someone. And here's what we've\n[01:31:56] discovered about nightmares.\n[01:32:00] Short sleep duration, not getting enough\n[01:32:02] sleep, sleeping less than six hours\n[01:32:04] predicts by about 100 to 150% higher\n[01:32:08] percentage chance of you having suicidal\n[01:32:11] thoughts, attempting suicide or\n[01:32:14] tragically suicide completion. That's\n[01:32:17] bad sleep.\n[01:32:19] It turns out that nightmares, so if\n[01:32:22] short sleep has a 150% higher likelihood\n[01:32:26] of suicidality,\n[01:32:29] having nightmares has an 800%\n[01:32:33] higher likelihood of suicidal tendencies\n[01:32:36] associated with it. Now, we don't think\n[01:32:38] that nightmares are causing suicidal\n[01:32:41] tendencies. That's not what we believe.\n[01:32:44] We believe, however, nightmares much\n[01:32:46] more than disrupted sleep. Nightmares\n[01:32:49] seem to be the canary in the coal mine.\n[01:32:52] Nightmares are this distress beacon that\n[01:32:54] leaks from our electrical static of\n[01:32:57] sleep at night and it is incredibly\n[01:33:00] sensitive to your suicidal tendencies,\n[01:33:03] your suicidal attempts and as I said\n[01:33:05] suicide completion as well. Nightmares\n[01:33:08] are a biomarker. If you are having\n[01:33:11] distressing nightmares that are waking\n[01:33:12] you up, you need to go and speak to\n[01:33:15] someone about it. It's absolutely\n[01:33:17] paramount because there are good\n[01:33:19] effective ways that you can dissipate\n[01:33:21] those nightmares.\n[01:33:23] >> I was trying to understand whether it's\n[01:33:24] a a malfunction or it's a signal. I\n[01:33:27] guess it might be both.\n[01:33:28] >> It's a very good question which is is it\n[01:33:31] adaptive or is it maladaptive? Is it a\n[01:33:35] good thing to have a nightmare or is it\n[01:33:37] a bad thing to have a nightmare? We\n[01:33:39] don't quite have the answer to that. But\n[01:33:42] let me come back to I told you there\n[01:33:43] were two functions of dream sleep and\n[01:33:45] we're still in the first one which is\n[01:33:47] emotional first aid and it turns out\n[01:33:49] that your thinking is incredibly astute.\n[01:33:52] We believe that at least normative\n[01:33:55] dreams not nightmares nightmares may be\n[01:33:57] the system failing just as I spoke about\n[01:33:59] in PTSD with repetitive nightmares and\n[01:34:03] in fact repetitive nightmares are so\n[01:34:04] consistent in PTSD that you can't\n[01:34:06] receive a diagnosis of PTSD without\n[01:34:08] having repetitive nightmares. That's how\n[01:34:10] sort of diagnostic they are. But\n[01:34:12] dreaming, normative dreaming, even if\n[01:34:15] they're bad dreams, is beneficial. How\n[01:34:18] could I make that claim? There was a\n[01:34:20] study done by a late sleep scientist, a\n[01:34:22] woman called Rosaline Cartwright, and\n[01:34:25] she was studying people who had gone\n[01:34:26] through a difficult period, let's say\n[01:34:28] bereiement or very bitter divorce. And\n[01:34:31] they had become depressed because of\n[01:34:33] that experience. And around the time of\n[01:34:35] the experience, she was seeing them as a\n[01:34:38] therapist and she was having them do\n[01:34:40] dream recall. So she was having them\n[01:34:42] create dream diaries every single night.\n[01:34:45] And then she tracked these patients for\n[01:34:46] a year. And it turned out about roughly\n[01:34:49] half of them by 12 months later had\n[01:34:52] remitted from their depression. They'd\n[01:34:53] got better. They'd got past their\n[01:34:55] depression. The other half were still\n[01:34:57] depressed. So then she took that data\n[01:35:01] and she went back with those two groups\n[01:35:03] and she said, \"Is there anything\n[01:35:04] different about their dreams and it\n[01:35:07] turned out that there was both of those\n[01:35:10] groups of people whether they cut free\n[01:35:12] of their depression or they stayed in\n[01:35:14] their depression. Both of them were\n[01:35:15] dreaming at the time. Both of them were\n[01:35:17] having REM sleep, both of them were\n[01:35:18] dreaming. What was the difference then?\n[01:35:21] Those individuals that went on to gain\n[01:35:23] remission to their depression and get\n[01:35:26] get better, those people were dreaming\n[01:35:28] of the events itself at the time that\n[01:35:32] they were happening. Whereas those other\n[01:35:34] people who didn't go on to gain clinical\n[01:35:35] remission, they were dreaming. They just\n[01:35:38] weren't dreaming of the experiences\n[01:35:40] itself. In other words, it's not just\n[01:35:43] sufficient to have REM sleep. It's not\n[01:35:45] just sufficient to have REM sleep and be\n[01:35:48] dreaming. You need to be dreaming of the\n[01:35:51] difficult, painful experience that\n[01:35:52] you're going through to gain that\n[01:35:54] clinical resolution.\n[01:35:55] >> Damn. So, if I have something going on\n[01:35:57] in my life, I need to think about it\n[01:35:58] before I go to bed.\n[01:35:59] >> Yes and no.\n[01:36:02] What you have to realize is that it's\n[01:36:05] taken us, depending on who you believe,\n[01:36:07] 3.4 million years of evolution to\n[01:36:10] develop this thing called homminid sleep\n[01:36:13] and dreaming and REM sleep.\n[01:36:15] I think that that evolutionary millions\n[01:36:19] of years probably understands what the\n[01:36:22] correct blueprint playlist of dream\n[01:36:26] experience is and should be for me at\n[01:36:29] night. And therefore, I don't need to\n[01:36:31] worry about it. I shouldn't try to force\n[01:36:32] anything. That's the first function of\n[01:36:35] dream sleep is that it's emotional first\n[01:36:38] aid. And we've got good data for that.\n[01:36:40] But there's a second completely\n[01:36:42] independent benefit of dreaming.\n[01:36:45] Dreaming is a form offormational\n[01:36:48] alchemy. Dreaming is creativity.\n[01:36:52] Now I told you that during deep non-REM\n[01:36:55] sleep, we take new memories that we've\n[01:36:56] learned and we fixate them like Amber\n[01:36:58] sort of setting a fossil in and we do\n[01:37:01] that during deep sleep. That saves the\n[01:37:04] individual pieces of the new stuff. Then\n[01:37:06] comes along REM sleep which happens\n[01:37:08] after deep sleep. And the second phase\n[01:37:11] of memory processing happens. That's\n[01:37:13] where REM sleep starts to fuse all of\n[01:37:15] the things that you've recently been\n[01:37:16] learning with this entire back catalog\n[01:37:19] of information. And so you wake up with\n[01:37:21] a revised mindwide web of associations\n[01:37:25] that is capable of diving solutions to\n[01:37:28] previously impenetrable problems. So,\n[01:37:31] you know, it's almost you, it's like\n[01:37:33] group therapy for memories that REM\n[01:37:35] sleep gathers in all of the information\n[01:37:37] that you've learned during the day and\n[01:37:38] everyone gets a name badge. But unlike\n[01:37:40] the waking logical connections that you\n[01:37:43] make already, REM sleep is like a Google\n[01:37:46] search gone wrong that you insert, let's\n[01:37:49] say, diary of a CEO, and it takes you to\n[01:37:52] page 20. This is dream sleep.\n[01:37:54] >> Mhm.\n[01:37:54] >> And it's about some field hockey game in\n[01:37:56] Utah. And you think, hang on a second,\n[01:37:59] but how on earth is that? Well, there\n[01:38:01] was someone who had, you know, they had\n[01:38:04] found a diary that had been lost, you\n[01:38:06] know, a long time ago. And the guy who'\n[01:38:08] found it was a famous CEO in the town of\n[01:38:10] this sort of, you know, Utah as he was\n[01:38:12] watching. So, it's a distant,\n[01:38:13] non-obvious connection. But it turns out\n[01:38:16] that that's what dreaming is all about.\n[01:38:18] It's almost as though we go to sleep\n[01:38:21] with the pieces of the jigsaw, but by\n[01:38:23] way of dreaming, we wake up with the\n[01:38:25] puzzle complete. And when you start to\n[01:38:28] fuse things that shouldn't should not\n[01:38:30] normally go together, but when they do\n[01:38:32] every now and again cause a marked\n[01:38:34] advance in evolutionary fitness, that is\n[01:38:37] the biological basis of creativity. It's\n[01:38:40] the reason that no one has ever told\n[01:38:42] you, \"Look, Stephen, you should stay\n[01:38:44] awake on a problem.\" They don't. They\n[01:38:46] tell you to sleep on a problem. And in\n[01:38:50] every language that I've inquired about\n[01:38:51] to date from, you know, from French to\n[01:38:55] Swahili, that term sleeping on a problem\n[01:38:59] or something like it exists. My point\n[01:39:01] being is the benefit, the creative\n[01:39:04] benefit of sleep transcends cultural\n[01:39:06] boundaries. It's a common experience of\n[01:39:08] homo sapiens.\n[01:39:10] >> There is an invisible tax on salespeople\n[01:39:12] that no one really talks about enough.\n[01:39:14] the mental load of remembering\n[01:39:15] everything like meeting notes,\n[01:39:17] timelines, and everything in between\n[01:39:19] until we started using our sponsors\n[01:39:21] product called Pipe Drive, one of the\n[01:39:23] best CRM tools for small and\n[01:39:24] medium-sized business owners. The idea\n[01:39:26] here was that it might alleviate some of\n[01:39:28] the unnecessary cognitive overload that\n[01:39:31] my team was carrying so that they could\n[01:39:32] spend less time in the weeds of admin\n[01:39:34] and more time with clients, in-person\n[01:39:36] meetings, and building relationships.\n[01:39:37] Pipe Drive has enabled this to happen.\n[01:39:39] It's such a simple but effective CRM\n[01:39:43] that automates the tedious, repetitive,\n[01:39:45] and timeconuming parts of the sales\n[01:39:46] process. And now our team can nurture\n[01:39:49] those leads and still have bandwidth to\n[01:39:51] focus on the higher priority tasks that\n[01:39:53] actually get the deal over the line.\n[01:39:55] Over a 100,000 companies across 170\n[01:39:58] countries already use Pipe Drive to grow\n[01:39:59] their business, and I've been using it\n[01:40:01] for almost a decade now.

You\n[01:41:13] know that they're probably looking\n[01:41:14] again. We have the optimizers, we have\n[01:41:16] those that have bad sleep habits and\n[01:41:17] then we have those that have real sleep\n[01:41:19] disorders. What is the most important\n[01:41:20] thing we haven't talked about that we\n[01:41:21] should have talked about for them?\n[01:41:23] >> It may be the dystopian future.\n[01:41:25] >> Let's talk about the dystopian future\n[01:41:27] then.\n[01:41:28] What is a podcast if it does not\n[01:41:30] contain, at least in this day and age, a\n[01:41:32] dystopian future?\n[01:41:33] >> What is the dystopian future?\n[01:41:36] >> Probably the most spectacular discovery\n[01:41:38] that has happened since you and I last\n[01:41:40] spoke is the discovery of what we call\n[01:41:42] the genetic short sleepers.\n[01:41:46] These are individuals who by way of a\n[01:41:48] genetic mutation can survive on as\n[01:41:51] little as 6.25 hours of sleep. In other\n[01:41:54] words, 6 hours and 15 minutes of sleep.\n[01:41:57] and they show zero impairment in their\n[01:42:00] brain or their body, they can do just\n[01:42:03] fine on six hours of sleep.\n[01:42:05] >> I know where this is going.\n[01:42:06] >> And we have four genes that we've\n[01:42:09] identified now. The first two genes. The\n[01:42:11] first one identified was called the DEC\n[01:42:13] 2 gene, DEC2 gene. The second was called\n[01:42:16] the ADRB1 gene, which I granted I know\n[01:42:20] it sounds like the next Radio Head\n[01:42:21] album, but it's it's not the next Radio\n[01:42:23] Head album. Um, and these genes allow\n[01:42:27] these individuals\n[01:42:29] to get away with an amount of sleep that\n[01:42:31] normally would cause predictive disease\n[01:42:34] and sickness just as we've spoken about.\n[01:42:36] So, at this point, probably some people\n[01:42:39] listening are thinking,\n[01:42:41] I think I'm one of those people. Just to\n[01:42:44] put it in context, your the probability\n[01:42:48] that you will be struck by lightning in\n[01:42:50] your lifetime is 0.00. 00064\n[01:42:55] highly unlikely the chances of you\n[01:42:58] having the ADRB1 gene is 0.004\n[01:43:03] >> and the DBR1 gene is the short sleeper\n[01:43:06] gene\n[01:43:06] >> is one of the short sleeping genes. So\n[01:43:07] in other words you are statistically\n[01:43:09] more likely to be struck by lightning in\n[01:43:12] your lifetime than you are to have that\n[01:43:14] short sleeping gene. So the probability\n[01:43:16] is is is low by the way.\n[01:43:20] Why is this the case? Why do they get\n[01:43:22] away with this? And we've discovered now\n[01:43:23] by using sort of um genetic\n[01:43:25] manipulations, we understand why. First\n[01:43:28] thing is that they have a much stronger\n[01:43:30] wake drive during the day. So you and I\n[01:43:32] and all the rest of our mere mortals\n[01:43:34] will have these kind of like\n[01:43:36] oscillations in our consciousness\n[01:43:38] throughout the day where we'll have dips\n[01:43:39] where we feel a bit sleepy and we're\n[01:43:41] dragging and then we'll kind of get they\n[01:43:43] don't have that. They have it's like a\n[01:43:45] light switch, like a dimmer switch. You\n[01:43:47] and I, we may sort of go up to like 80%\n[01:43:50] brightness when we're awake and then\n[01:43:52] sometimes it will flicker and then we'll\n[01:43:54] go down and we'll have pretty solid\n[01:43:56] sleep, maybe sort of, you know, down to\n[01:43:58] 20% but the lights are not quite off,\n[01:44:00] you know, where sleep is is good but not\n[01:44:03] amazing. These people have an all or\n[01:44:06] nothing phenomenon. They are all 100%\n[01:44:09] bright light throughout the day and then\n[01:44:12] and they can maintain 17 18 hours of\n[01:44:15] wakefulness, no problem.\n[01:44:17] And then when they sleep, they sleep\n[01:44:19] hard. They have much more efficient\n[01:44:22] sleep. Remember we spoke about sleep\n[01:44:23] efficiency and I want it 85% or above.\n[01:44:26] Almost all of their time at night spent\n[01:44:28] in solid, stable, sound sleep. And the\n[01:44:31] depth of their sleep they have is\n[01:44:33] greater. So they're awake more\n[01:44:34] throughout the day. They build up a\n[01:44:36] stronger wakefulness drive which is\n[01:44:38] called adenosine which means that when\n[01:44:40] they sleep they sleep harder throughout\n[01:44:42] the night which means that they can then\n[01:44:44] be awake for more powerful stints during\n[01:44:46] the day. Second they don't suffer from\n[01:44:48] jet lag.\n[01:44:49] >> What the what do you mean they don't\n[01:44:52] suffer from jet lag?\n[01:44:53] >> Because of their strength of wakefulness\n[01:44:55] drive when they are circadium misaligned\n[01:44:57] it's as though they haven't traveled\n[01:44:58] between time zones. They can just stay\n[01:45:01] awake. They have a strong drive for\n[01:45:03] wakefulness. Who are these people?\n[01:45:05] >> They are these genetic short sleepers.\n[01:45:08] >> And do they pass these genes onto their\n[01:45:10] children?\n[01:45:10] >> Yes, they do.\n[01:45:11] >> And so their children have the same\n[01:45:12] >> they're heritable.\n[01:45:14] >> Can I have\n[01:45:15] >> Well, firstly, let's take a step back\n[01:45:17] before I get to the dystopian. This\n[01:45:19] tells us something above and beyond\n[01:45:21] biological fascination. It says there is\n[01:45:24] a profound statement in evolution.\n[01:45:28] Mother nature has figured out a way\n[01:45:30] genetically to zip file sleep.\n[01:45:32] >> Zip file. You can compress eight down\n[01:45:36] into six. You know on your computer how\n[01:45:38] you can get a collection of files, you\n[01:45:40] group them all together and then you say\n[01:45:41] compress these files and you compress\n[01:45:43] them and you zip them into a single file\n[01:45:46] and it's dense, it's packed and it takes\n[01:45:48] up less amount of volume.\n[01:45:52] >> Do they have the same life expectancy?\n[01:45:54] >> They seem to from everything we can\n[01:45:55] tell.\n[01:45:57] So somewhere along the way through\n[01:46:00] genetics, evolution has figured out how\n[01:46:02] to go from eight and compress it down to\n[01:46:04] six. Where's the dystopia? Well, we've\n[01:46:07] all heard of crisper, which is this\n[01:46:09] genetic editing manipulation tool that a\n[01:46:12] lab next door to mine at UC Berkeley\n[01:46:14] discovered, Jennifer Downer. She won a\n[01:46:15] Nobel Prize for it. Is there some\n[01:46:18] future,\n[01:46:20] and I hope not. Is there some future\n[01:46:22] where we start to genetically engineer\n[01:46:24] people from a need of 7 to n hours down\n[01:46:27] to a need of six? Imagine the reduction\n[01:46:30] in health care burden cost because right\n[01:46:33] now the burden of insufficient sleep is\n[01:46:36] vast.\n[01:46:38] Insufficient sleep will cost most\n[01:46:39] nations about 2% of their GDP. Here in\n[01:46:42] America it's $411 billion of cost caused\n[01:46:46] by insufficient sleep. In the United\n[01:46:48] Kingdom it's about $40 billion. In\n[01:46:50] Japan, it's $50 billion.\n[01:46:52] Solve the sleep loss epidemic, which\n[01:46:55] I've been trying to do by saying, you\n[01:46:56] know, sleep enough. And you could, you\n[01:46:59] know, cause massive financial disruption\n[01:47:01] in the good way. But here, if you start\n[01:47:04] to genetically engineer people, could\n[01:47:07] you reduce the burden that is caused by\n[01:47:09] people currently who need 7 to9 and take\n[01:47:13] that burden away because they no longer\n[01:47:15] need 7 to9?\n[01:47:16] >> Why did you say I hope not? Well, I hope\n[01:47:18] not because I think here's the following\n[01:47:21] that happens. It's not that I'm against\n[01:47:23] that idea. I would love for the burden\n[01:47:25] of disease and sickness to be reduced\n[01:47:27] and people not to suffer from that. And\n[01:47:29] if I could find a way to do it\n[01:47:30] genetically, I would. And you could\n[01:47:32] think about people arguing, well,\n[01:47:33] imagine the productivity benefits. I\n[01:47:36] mean, huge upsides of that. You know,\n[01:47:39] people are being more productive and\n[01:47:40] they're probably spending more. So from\n[01:47:42] a capitalistic society, it's the perfect\n[01:47:44] it's the adman's dream because when when\n[01:47:46] you're asleep, it's antithetical to a\n[01:47:48] capitalistic society. Why? Because\n[01:47:49] you're neither producing nor consuming.\n[01:47:51] That's very cynical and I don't buy into\n[01:47:53] that. But nevertheless, so all of these\n[01:47:55] things would be marketkedly better,\n[01:47:56] would they not be, if we genetically\n[01:47:58] engineered this way. Why do I fear it? I\n[01:48:01] know for a fact that as soon as six\n[01:48:04] becomes the new eight, everyone starts\n[01:48:07] sleeping four.\n[01:48:09] And now I'm just back into the same\n[01:48:11] battle again because six is the minimum\n[01:48:13] that you need. And they say, \"Well, if\n[01:48:14] that's the minimum, then I'll sleep\n[01:48:16] four.\" And when I find the next gene\n[01:48:18] that allows you to get away with four\n[01:48:19] hours of sleep, then they say, \"Well,\n[01:48:20] that's great. So then I can go down to\n[01:48:22] two.\" And it's a form of almost this\n[01:48:24] sleep currency, you know, inflation that\n[01:48:27] I'm always fighting a battle and at some\n[01:48:30] point I'll always be on the wrong side\n[01:48:32] of that battle.\n[01:48:34] >> Crazy. These people with this gene can\n[01:48:38] thrive on four to six hours sleep\n[01:48:39] without any negative effects that most\n[01:48:43] of us would experience.\n[01:48:45] >> Correct. It's\n[01:48:46] >> so you know what is going on there and\n[01:48:49] what we're seeing is this this\n[01:48:50] incredible density of sleep and this\n[01:48:54] epic drive for wakefulness. They are\n[01:48:57] more efficient sleepers. They can get\n[01:48:58] done what you and I take eight hours to\n[01:49:01] do. They can do it in six. And I guess\n[01:49:03] you is there a way to easily test this?\n[01:49:05] I guess go into a lab and get\n[01:49:06] >> Yeah. So if you've ever done, you know,\n[01:49:08] I think um you know all of those genetic\n[01:49:10] testing kits out there where and a lot\n[01:49:12] of them will allow you to download your\n[01:49:14] raw data. All you need to do is download\n[01:49:16] your raw raw data and then there's a\n[01:49:18] company I think it's called Prometheus.\n[01:49:20] Again, I have no affiliation with them.\n[01:49:21] I don't know how valid they are, but\n[01:49:23] then you upload your raw genetic data\n[01:49:26] into their model and then it will list\n[01:49:29] and it will rip it apart. So normally\n[01:49:30] those genetic services they give you a\n[01:49:32] nice PDF and it's kind of like maybe 15\n[01:49:35] pages of all of the the main stuff and\n[01:49:36] it's this Prometheus is kind of like the\n[01:49:39] you know the old school kind of\n[01:49:42] scientist nerdy. They will just give you\n[01:49:44] this kind of raw just kind of janky you\n[01:49:48] know 50page report. The interface is\n[01:49:51] terrible, but you can go in there and\n[01:49:52] you can search to see, you know, what\n[01:49:55] form of the deck 2 gene do I have or\n[01:49:58] what form of the ADRB1 gene do I have?\n[01:50:01] And it will tell you, are you a genetic\n[01:50:03] short sleeper or are you not and you can\n[01:50:05] find out.\n[01:50:06] >> I've been thinking a lot lately about um\n[01:50:08] about certain diet states as well and\n[01:50:10] whether they have an impact on sleep.\n[01:50:11] We're talking about circadian rhythms\n[01:50:12] there. I was thinking about fasting a\n[01:50:14] lot and also I think me myself and Jack\n[01:50:17] over there are in ketosis right now. I\n[01:50:20] was wondering if you\n[01:50:21] >> when you think about brain performance\n[01:50:22] and sleep and different sort of states\n[01:50:24] do you think much about fasting or\n[01:50:27] >> about ketosis or\n[01:50:29] >> Yeah, it's a mixed bag if you look at\n[01:50:32] it. Certainly what you eat will change\n[01:50:35] how you sleep. But perhaps more\n[01:50:38] powerfully is how you sleep dramatically\n[01:50:41] changes how you eat and how you dispose\n[01:50:44] of those calories and what happens\n[01:50:45] inside of your body when you are\n[01:50:48] underslept.\n[01:50:49] >> But\n[01:50:50] >> so I have lots of cravings when I've\n[01:50:52] short slept.\n[01:50:53] >> Yes, you have. And there's a reason why\n[01:50:55] is firstly two appetite hormones called\n[01:50:58] leptin and ghrein will go in opposite\n[01:51:00] directions. So they sound like hobbits,\n[01:51:03] I And I've got some Lord of the Rings\n[01:51:04] thing here, but leptin is the signal\n[01:51:07] that says to your brain, you're full.\n[01:51:09] >> Yeah,\n[01:51:10] >> you're you're satiated. Don't eat\n[01:51:12] anymore. Ghrein is the opposite. It kind\n[01:51:14] of makes your tum stom tummy growl and\n[01:51:17] it says you're hungry. You're not full.\n[01:51:19] You need to eat more. When you are\n[01:51:21] underslept, leptin, which says you're\n[01:51:23] full, stop eating. That hormone is\n[01:51:26] impaired. It drops away. So you lose the\n[01:51:29] I'm full signal. and worse still the\n[01:51:32] ghrelin signal which says I'm hungry\n[01:51:34] that increases\n[01:51:36] and so now you have about a 30 to 40%\n[01:51:39] increased hunger drive and the final\n[01:51:42] part of this is that when you are\n[01:51:44] underslept and taking on board calories\n[01:51:47] the way that you dispose of that energy\n[01:51:49] is different your body has a higher\n[01:51:53] prediliction when you are sleepdeprived\n[01:51:55] to disposing of calories as fat rather\n[01:51:59] than storing it for example as glycogen\n[01:52:01] in the muscles.\n[01:52:03] >> Oh, so when I'm under slept, um that's\n[01:52:05] why you know you're more likely to get\n[01:52:06] belly fat.\n[01:52:07] >> Correct. And what's worse is that there\n[01:52:10] was a great study where they looked at\n[01:52:12] people who were dieting and either\n[01:52:14] getting sufficient sleep or not getting\n[01:52:16] sufficient sleep. What was fascinating\n[01:52:18] is that both of those groups, whether\n[01:52:20] you were well-slept or not wellslept,\n[01:52:22] you both lost weight. In fact, you lost\n[01:52:24] about the same amount of weight. So\n[01:52:26] you'd think, okay, so that's fine. The\n[01:52:28] problem was if you looked at what you\n[01:52:30] were losing, there was an issue. Those\n[01:52:33] people who were dieting but not getting\n[01:52:35] sufficient sleep, 70% of all the weight\n[01:52:38] that they lost came from lean muscle\n[01:52:41] mass and not fat. In other words, when\n[01:52:44] you're not getting sufficient sleep, you\n[01:52:47] keep what you want to lose, which is\n[01:52:50] fat, and you lose what you want to keep,\n[01:52:54] which is muscle.\n[01:52:55] >> Oh gosh. Damn. It's important, isn't it?\n[01:52:58] The sleep stuff.\n[01:52:59] >> But coming back to ketosis, by the way,\n[01:53:00] I would say when people go into a fasted\n[01:53:03] state, usually what we see is that their\n[01:53:06] sleep gets shorter.\n[01:53:08] >> And they'll say, \"I sleep almost more\n[01:53:10] efficiently. I'll sleep for maybe just\n[01:53:12] four or five hours, but I feel more\n[01:53:15] alert and more awake.\"\n[01:53:17] Now, some of that has to do with the\n[01:53:19] ketosis. When you are calorically\n[01:53:22] deprived,\n[01:53:23] the brain starts to realize that\n[01:53:26] something is wrong because you are\n[01:53:27] lacking calories. You're going into\n[01:53:29] starvation. So, it drives on a chemical\n[01:53:32] called ereexin. Ereexin is a\n[01:53:34] wakeomotmoting chemical and it forces\n[01:53:37] your brain to release much more of this\n[01:53:39] wakefulness chemical called ereexin. So\n[01:53:42] now when you're fasting, it's easier to\n[01:53:45] stay awake for longer and your brain\n[01:53:47] will deliberately stop you from sleeping\n[01:53:49] as much.\n[01:53:51] >> It's not because it wants you to sleep\n[01:53:54] less. It's because the only time during\n[01:53:56] our evolutionary past that we\n[01:53:59] unexperienced short sleep was when we\n[01:54:02] were in a caloric deficit. And the\n[01:54:03] reason came comes back again to this\n[01:54:05] idea that you have to stay awake longer\n[01:54:07] because you're not finding food. Now,\n[01:54:09] your brain doesn't know you've\n[01:54:11] deliberately decided to fast, which is a\n[01:54:13] good thing in lots of ways. But that's\n[01:54:15] one of the reasons that when people are\n[01:54:17] fasting, they'll say, \"My sleep goes to\n[01:54:20] >> peck in a hand basket.\" You know,\n[01:54:22] >> mine goes really really short. So, when\n[01:54:23] I'm I'm in ketosis now and I'm like in\n[01:54:25] on my way in and my sleep will reduce to\n[01:54:27] about five five six hours, my Whoop\n[01:54:30] scores plummet.\n[01:54:31] >> Yeah.\n[01:54:32] >> Until I kind of come out the other end,\n[01:54:33] which might take a couple of weeks and\n[01:54:35] then my sleep scores seem to stabilize\n[01:54:37] again. But that initial transition\n[01:54:39] period, it looks like it's having a\n[01:54:40] physiological shock.\n[01:54:41] >> It is. And the shock is this chemical\n[01:54:43] ereexin, which is this wakering chemical\n[01:54:46] which will force you to stay awake in a\n[01:54:48] very solid fashion. By the way, case in\n[01:54:50] point, people with narcolepsy,\n[01:54:53] this sleep disorder where they\n[01:54:54] inadvertently and uncontrollably fall\n[01:54:56] asleep during the day. They have the\n[01:54:58] opposite. I just telling I was just\n[01:55:00] telling you that when you are fasting,\n[01:55:02] your brain dumps out this chemical\n[01:55:04] erection to force you awake and you're\n[01:55:06] wide awake. People with narcolepsy when\n[01:55:08] we've studied their brains, they have a\n[01:55:11] deficiency of this brain chemical\n[01:55:12] arexin. So they can't stay awake in a\n[01:55:16] stable fashion. They have the opposite\n[01:55:18] of your fasting problem. You're wide\n[01:55:20] awake because you've got too much\n[01:55:21] erection. They've got too little Rexin\n[01:55:24] and they therefore they can't sustain\n[01:55:27] stable wakefulness during the day. So\n[01:55:28] they're constantly falling asleep. M\n[01:55:31] >> this story of ereexin has led to the\n[01:55:34] invention of the first new class of\n[01:55:36] sleeping medication that I actually\n[01:55:38] favor and most people are not aware of\n[01:55:40] it. It's a new class of we're on to\n[01:55:42] essentially web 3.0 of sleep medication.\n[01:55:45] Web 1.0 were the benzoazipines things\n[01:55:48] like Xanax and Valium not great for\n[01:55:51] sleep. The second wave the web 2.0 those\n[01:55:54] were things like ambient lanesta sonata.\n[01:55:58] Both of those drugs worked in a very\n[01:56:00] similar way where they go up to your\n[01:56:02] cortex and they tickle a receptor called\n[01:56:06] the GABA receptor, GABA, GABA. And it's\n[01:56:09] the major neuroinhibitory transmitter of\n[01:56:12] the brain. So when these drugs flood\n[01:56:14] your brain, they just hit the red light\n[01:56:16] and they stop neural firing of the\n[01:56:18] cortex. Essentially, they sedate you.\n[01:56:21] And sedation is not sleep. But when you\n[01:56:24] take an ambient, you mistake sedation\n[01:56:27] for sleep.\n[01:56:28] >> It's not quite the same. It's not\n[01:56:30] naturalistic sleep.\n[01:56:32] >> But after we realized by way of the\n[01:56:35] story of narcolepsy that narcopsy\n[01:56:37] patients, they don't have this chemical\n[01:56:39] erection and they're falling asleep\n[01:56:41] inappropriately during the day. Well,\n[01:56:43] think about what insomnia is at night.\n[01:56:46] Insomnia is almost the opposite of\n[01:56:49] narcopsy, which is that narcolepsy\n[01:56:52] patients, they're falling asleep during\n[01:56:54] the day when they want to be awake.\n[01:56:57] Insomnia patients are awake at night\n[01:56:59] when they want to be asleep. So what\n[01:57:01] they realized is that what we can do if\n[01:57:04] this chemical ereexin, this wakefulness\n[01:57:06] volume button in the brain is a problem\n[01:57:10] in insomnia patients. What if we were to\n[01:57:12] just develop a drug that doesn't sedate\n[01:57:15] the cortex like ambient? Instead, it\n[01:57:18] goes down into the brain stem where the\n[01:57:19] center for erection is. And these new\n[01:57:22] drugs and they're called the Doras\n[01:57:24] drugs, D A small s. And it's a class of\n[01:57:28] drugs. There are three FDA approved and\n[01:57:31] I'll try and spell them out for you.\n[01:57:33] They're called suvaxent, lumberexent,\n[01:57:36] and daredexent.\n[01:57:38] Exactly. Why my sinapses are filled with\n[01:57:41] things like those names, but there you\n[01:57:42] go. They're three FDA approved drugs.\n[01:57:45] And what they do is they act like a\n[01:57:47] clever set of chemical fingers. They go\n[01:57:49] down into the brain stem where this sort\n[01:57:51] of erection is being released and they\n[01:57:53] just dial down the volume on wakefulness\n[01:57:56] and then they take a step back and they\n[01:57:58] allow the antithesis of wakefulness to\n[01:58:00] come in its place which is this thing\n[01:58:02] called naturalistic sleep. Now if you\n[01:58:06] look at that those clinical data they\n[01:58:09] absolutely make you sleep for uh not\n[01:58:12] necessarily a longer period of time but\n[01:58:14] you're awake a lot less. So you've got\n[01:58:16] nice sleep efficiency, more continuity.\n[01:58:19] But I as a scientist could be very\n[01:58:21] skeptical and I could come along and\n[01:58:23] say, \"Okay, so this new drug, it\n[01:58:26] increases your total sleep time,\n[01:58:27] improves your sleep efficiency, but I\n[01:58:30] have four words. Yes. And so what? Just\n[01:58:34] because I've added sleep to your night,\n[01:58:37] how do I know that that's functional\n[01:58:39] sleep? How do I know that that's useful\n[01:58:40] sleep? Couldn't it just be like junk\n[01:58:42] DNA? It could be just junk sleep. Well,\n[01:58:45] they did a study where they looked at\n[01:58:47] what we call the glimpmphatic system in\n[01:58:50] your brain. There's a cleansing system\n[01:58:51] in your brain that kicks into high gear\n[01:58:53] during deep non-REM sleep. And it\n[01:58:56] flushes the brain of all of the\n[01:58:58] metabolic toxins, two of which are\n[01:59:00] things called beta amalloid and ta\n[01:59:02] protein, which are the culprits of\n[01:59:04] Alzheimer's. And that's why we know that\n[01:59:05] sleep is so important because at night,\n[01:59:07] it's a good night sleep clean. It's a\n[01:59:09] power cleanse that washes away the\n[01:59:11] Alzheimer's toxins. So they did a study.\n[01:59:14] Heavens knows how they got these people\n[01:59:16] to participate. But they brought them\n[01:59:18] in. They were 50 years or older and in\n[01:59:21] the morning and the night before they\n[01:59:23] had a lumbar spinal puncture and they\n[01:59:26] siphoned off cerebral spinal fluid. So\n[01:59:29] they could measure how much of the\n[01:59:31] metabolic detritis was in the brain\n[01:59:33] before sleep and in the brain after\n[01:59:35] sleep including\n[01:59:37] >> the metabolic waste product sort of\n[01:59:39] including beta amalloid and and tow\n[01:59:41] protein\n[01:59:42] >> and they either had one of these drugs\n[01:59:46] the Doras drugs or they had a placebo\n[01:59:49] and fair enough when they took the this\n[01:59:51] new class of medication the web 3.0 to\n[01:59:53] the Dora drug, their sleep got better.\n[01:59:56] But what they also found is that not\n[01:59:58] only did their sleep get better, but\n[02:00:00] they had cleansed the brain the next\n[02:00:03] morning of more beta amaloid and ta\n[02:00:06] protein than the placebo group. In other\n[02:00:08] words, it wasn't just epifenomenal junk\n[02:00:11] sleep. It was beneficial sleep. It was\n[02:00:14] adaptive useful sleep because that drug\n[02:00:17] induced sleep had washed away more of\n[02:00:19] the Alzheimer's proteins. And it was the\n[02:00:22] first demonstration and they've now\n[02:00:23] replicated it in animal models that this\n[02:00:26] is a sleeping pill that isn't\n[02:00:29] disadvantageous\n[02:00:31] which we know to be the case for things\n[02:00:33] like ambient. In fact, ambient there was\n[02:00:35] a recent study that showed that it\n[02:00:36] decreases the cleansing pulsing fluid by\n[02:00:40] about 30 to 40% at night. But this is a\n[02:00:43] new class of medications that does the\n[02:00:45] opposite.\n[02:00:45] >> And this is new.\n[02:00:46] >> And this is new. The Doras drugs D O R A\n[02:00:49] small s. problem is that a lot of\n[02:00:51] insurance companies here in the United\n[02:00:53] States currently do not reimburse. Some\n[02:00:55] do and I believe that it's some of these\n[02:00:59] of the three doors drugs, not all of\n[02:01:00] them are available in Europe or in the\n[02:01:02] UK.\n[02:01:03] >> Probably about right\n[02:01:04] >> and because they're just so expensive\n[02:01:05] and if you pay out of pocket, it can be\n[02:01:08] up to $400 a month for these\n[02:01:11] medications. Now, some insomnia patients\n[02:01:13] when I go to them and say, \"At the end\n[02:01:14] of a shockingly bad month of sleep, if I\n[02:01:17] went to them and said, \"Look, if you\n[02:01:18] gave me $400 now, could I I could wave a\n[02:01:21] magic wand and eradicate all of that bad\n[02:01:24] sleep over the previous month, would you\n[02:01:25] like to give me $400?\" Most of them\n[02:01:27] would say, \"Absolutely, take my money.\"\n[02:01:29] But still, people are being priced out\n[02:01:31] at this stage, but the Doris drugs,\n[02:01:33] please look into them if you're\n[02:01:34] struggling with insomnia as well as\n[02:01:36] CBTI. I didn't realize there was so much\n[02:01:39] new science and research that had been\n[02:01:41] discovered on how to sleep well, what's\n[02:01:44] going on in the brain, and also some of\n[02:01:45] the lifestyle factors that have made\n[02:01:48] sleeping so hard for so many people. And\n[02:01:50] with that in mind, I want to do\n[02:01:52] something that I've never done before,\n[02:01:52] which is a world first for the Diary of\n[02:01:54] a SEO. Is I'm going to put a link below\n[02:01:57] because I think this is a particular\n[02:01:58] episode where if you share this\n[02:02:01] conversation with some of your friends\n[02:02:02] who particularly struggle with sleep or\n[02:02:04] sleep optimizers or who have sleep\n[02:02:06] disorders, they'll get a ton of benefit\n[02:02:08] from it. So, what I'm going to do is in\n[02:02:10] the description of wherever you're\n[02:02:11] listening to this podcast right now,\n[02:02:12] there is a link. And if you click on\n[02:02:14] that link, um you'll see that you've got\n[02:02:16] your own personalized link to share this\n[02:02:18] episode. And those of you that share\n[02:02:20] this episode, whether it's on your\n[02:02:22] story, on social media or in a WhatsApp\n[02:02:23] group or wherever, on email with your\n[02:02:25] friends, you will collect points for\n[02:02:28] every person that listens and I will\n[02:02:29] reward those. Um, you'll see as you\n[02:02:32] click on the link who have shared it the\n[02:02:34] most. In part, I say this because so\n[02:02:35] many of you come up to me in the street\n[02:02:36] and they came up to me after our last\n[02:02:38] conversation and they said, um, that\n[02:02:40] conversation you did with Matt Walker\n[02:02:41] was so amazing. I sent it to my aunt and\n[02:02:43] she now d she did this and she's changed\n[02:02:45] this and blah blah blah blah and she's\n[02:02:46] now sleeping well. And then all the\n[02:02:48] downstream impacts of that have been\n[02:02:50] profound. So\n[02:02:51] >> I'm going to create this little system\n[02:02:53] to encourage all of you to share it with\n[02:02:54] someone that um is struggling at the\n[02:02:56] moment with sleep because I do believe I\n[02:02:57] do believe that sleep is upstream from\n[02:03:00] so many of the downstream symptoms that\n[02:03:03] ruin our lives whether it's relationship\n[02:03:05] issues whether it's libido issues or\n[02:03:07] whether it's creativity issues. I mean,\n[02:03:09] I was reading through your work and I\n[02:03:10] saw your conversation with Rogan not so\n[02:03:12] long ago where you talked about the fact\n[02:03:14] that a sleep-d deprived person has their\n[02:03:16] genes fundamentally working differently.\n[02:03:18] You talked about 700 genes working\n[02:03:20] differently.\n[02:03:20] >> Yeah. 711 genes are distorted in their\n[02:03:23] activity caused by a lack of sleep. Some\n[02:03:25] genes that are overexpressed that are\n[02:03:27] related to cardiovascular disease or\n[02:03:29] stress or inflammation and other genes\n[02:03:32] that are impaired which are associated\n[02:03:34] with your immune system. So you become\n[02:03:36] immune deficient\n[02:03:37] >> and it can be a downward compounding\n[02:03:38] spiral if you're such a person that's\n[02:03:40] really continually strugg struggling\n[02:03:42] with sleep and building up some of that\n[02:03:43] sleep debt. So that link is below. Check\n[02:03:45] it out. And we have a closing tradition\n[02:03:47] on this podcast where the last leaves a\n[02:03:49] question for the next. The question left\n[02:03:50] for you is what did success bring you\n[02:03:53] that you never could have dreamed of?\n[02:03:58] It brought me two things.\n[02:04:01] one beneficial one less. So\n[02:04:06] beneficial is that I have now the chance\n[02:04:09] and have gifted the chance to\n[02:04:14] fly around the world and tried to speak\n[02:04:18] the word of sleep because the physiology\n[02:04:20] of it is so silent. And I used to lament\n[02:04:24] why me because there are so many other\n[02:04:26] much better sleep scientists in the\n[02:04:28] world than me. And a friend after I was\n[02:04:31] saying like I don't understand why me\n[02:04:32] imposter syndrome and he just told me to\n[02:04:35] shut up and accept that it's you and\n[02:04:40] instead asked the question what are you\n[02:04:41] going to do with it and I changed how I\n[02:04:44] embraced that. So I've been so fortunate\n[02:04:46] that my life after publishing the book\n[02:04:48] that you're holding\n[02:04:50] changed forever and almost all for the\n[02:04:53] better. And I'm so fortunate. I have\n[02:04:56] lived a life of such fortune by way of\n[02:04:59] the sleep mission. I would say though\n[02:05:02] that there is\n[02:05:05] also, and I suspect you may experience\n[02:05:08] some of this too, when you raise your\n[02:05:11] head above the public parapit,\n[02:05:14] don't be surprised if shots are fired.\n[02:05:17] And if you're someone who has even the\n[02:05:20] vaguest\n[02:05:24] hint of insecurity,\n[02:05:28] comments will do you a lovely\n[02:05:30] disservice. And so I think there's a\n[02:05:32] degree of kind of vulnerability and\n[02:05:35] insecurity that you can develop by way\n[02:05:37] of becoming um someone who is in the eye\n[02:05:40] of the public that had I not been in the\n[02:05:42] eye of the public I probably wouldn't\n[02:05:44] have been you know as self-conscious\n[02:05:46] about whether it's you know your\n[02:05:48] intellect or your voice or your you know\n[02:05:52] disastrous you know boyband haircut\n[02:05:54] whatever it is um I would say that's the\n[02:05:56] only slight downside overall I am the\n[02:06:00] most fortunate human that I know. I am\n[02:06:03] so gifted by way of this thing called\n[02:06:04] sleep. It's a love affair that's lasted\n[02:06:06] me almost 25 years and I believe it's\n[02:06:10] the most beguiling topic in all of\n[02:06:12] science and it has treated me so well.\n[02:06:15] >> You happy?\n[02:06:18] >> More than you could imagine at this\n[02:06:21] moment in my life. I am the happiest\n[02:06:24] I've been.\n[02:06:26] >> Why? I have a a piece that I found in\n[02:06:30] life\n[02:06:32] for reasons that I can share or not\n[02:06:33] share. And\n[02:06:35] >> go ahead and share them. I'd love in my\n[02:06:36] life.\n[02:06:37] >> You know, I found my person\n[02:06:38] >> and and she is she\n[02:06:43] appeared like lightning from a clear\n[02:06:45] blue sky. Never saw her coming.\n[02:06:49] And\n[02:06:52] it's interesting that\n[02:06:57] I've never been able to be more myself,\n[02:07:01] even with myself,\n[02:07:03] than I have with her.\n[02:07:06] Every day she makes me want to be a\n[02:07:08] better person.\n[02:07:10] And\n[02:07:14] I have found peace that I have never had\n[02:07:16] before.\n[02:07:18] >> That you've never had before?\n[02:07:20] >> No.\n[02:07:21] >> Did you have peace last time we spoke?\n[02:07:24] I wouldn't say I was without peace. I\n[02:07:28] didn't know this type of peace\n[02:07:31] and I never believed in this notion of\n[02:07:33] the one. You know, I was a scientist.\n[02:07:34] I'm a hard-nosed empirical kind of guy\n[02:07:38] and I just did not imagine it would be\n[02:07:41] such\n[02:07:42] uh I didn't think there was such a one.\n[02:07:45] I would have told you if you'd told me\n[02:07:47] that two years ago, you'd given me your\n[02:07:49] love story of certainty. I would have\n[02:07:52] thought you're misguided and that, you\n[02:07:55] know, you just need to put down whatever\n[02:07:59] substances you're using because you're\n[02:08:00] delusional because there isn't such a\n[02:08:02] thing.\n[02:08:03] >> Um,\n[02:08:07] she's a gift\n[02:08:09] and I hope I never take her for granted.\n[02:08:12] I doubt it. There's a an incredibly sad\n[02:08:15] story\n[02:08:17] of a gentleman called Clive Wearing. And\n[02:08:20] Clive is a famous individual in the\n[02:08:22] neuroscience world. And Clive was the\n[02:08:27] man who the movie Momento\n[02:08:30] was based on, which is a movie where a\n[02:08:33] man has brain damage and he has profound\n[02:08:35] amnesia. And from that moment forward,\n[02:08:37] he can never make any new memories\n[02:08:39] whatsoever. He's densely amnesic.\n[02:08:42] And he was a real life individual. He\n[02:08:45] contracted a virus that destroyed his\n[02:08:48] memory centers. And from that point\n[02:08:50] forward, he could no longer make any new\n[02:08:51] memories. And he lived in just 2 or 3\n[02:08:54] seconds of time. And that spotlight of\n[02:08:57] consciousness just moved forward in\n[02:08:58] time. He had no recollection of the\n[02:09:00] past. He had no anticipation of the\n[02:09:02] future. And the only thing, the only\n[02:09:05] person that he remembered and he would\n[02:09:07] recognize is his wife. So he could have\n[02:09:09] spent this whole three hours speaking to\n[02:09:11] you. And then you would walk out the\n[02:09:13] room for five minutes and you would walk\n[02:09:15] back in and you'd say, \"Hi Clive, nice\n[02:09:17] to meet you.\" and he'd say, \"Hi, what's\n[02:09:18] your name?\" Had no recollection. The\n[02:09:21] only person that he remembered was his\n[02:09:22] wife. But the problem was he never\n[02:09:25] remembered how long it's been since he\n[02:09:27] last saw his wife. And so every time\n[02:09:31] that she would walk into the room after\n[02:09:33] being out of it for 5 minutes, he would\n[02:09:35] jump out of his chair and he had this\n[02:09:38] incredible elation and he would run and\n[02:09:42] he would hug her and kiss her. And I\n[02:09:44] think sometimes we take our partners for\n[02:09:46] granted\n[02:09:48] and the only time we realize how\n[02:09:50] precious they are is when they're gone.\n[02:09:53] And I often think about that that\n[02:09:55] complacency can be one of the greatest\n[02:09:58] negative forces in a relationship. And I\n[02:10:00] always think about Clive Weiring even on\n[02:10:03] the days where I'm having a bad day or\n[02:10:04] I'm in a bad mood and I'm not myself or\n[02:10:07] I just don't want to be around someone.\n[02:10:09] I always try to remember his reaction.\n[02:10:12] And when my wife walks back in from work\n[02:10:14] or I see her, you know, first thing, I\n[02:10:17] try to remember how his reaction was and\n[02:10:21] how I truly feel at the time despite the\n[02:10:23] blanket of negative stress trying to\n[02:10:27] drown that feeling out.\n[02:10:31] >> It's a beautiful thing. I think about\n[02:10:33] that a lot as well.\n[02:10:34] >> In what way? just the part of I'm way\n[02:10:37] more cognizant now on a frequent basis\n[02:10:40] almost on a weekly basis of how I'm\n[02:10:43] going to feel\n[02:10:45] when my time is up as it relates to rel\n[02:10:48] my romantic relationship like I think\n[02:10:50] even like mid argument I will now think\n[02:10:53] and this actually happened like a couple\n[02:10:54] of days ago it wasn't really an argument\n[02:10:55] we're disagreeing about something I\n[02:10:57] literally said mid mid uh dispute that\n[02:10:59] we were having I said we're going to\n[02:11:01] regret this so much and what I meant was\n[02:11:04] when I when that When that phone call\n[02:11:05] rings and someone gives me bad news that\n[02:11:07] either I'm going or you're going, I'm\n[02:11:09] going to regret that this 30 minutes was\n[02:11:11] wasted doing this.\n[02:11:12] >> Yeah.\n[02:11:12] >> I'm really going to regret it.\n[02:11:14] >> How much would you give to have that 30\n[02:11:15] minutes?\n[02:11:16] >> Exactly. And it's like, you know, we're\n[02:11:17]  arguing about, I don't know,\n[02:11:19] some whatever it might be, some trivial\n[02:11:21] thing. It's actually really helped me\n[02:11:22] because in the midst of those storms,\n[02:11:25] um, thinking through to that moment when\n[02:11:26] you get that phone call and like you're\n[02:11:28] ill or I'm ill and some we're not going\n[02:11:29] to be around much longer.\n[02:11:31] um it liberates you from the pettiness\n[02:11:35] that a sense of immortality can create\n[02:11:37] and that pettiness results in the\n[02:11:39] complacency that you're describing that\n[02:11:41] like I I took you for granted.\n[02:11:44] >> Yeah.\n[02:11:44] >> So it's a nice little mechanism now for\n[02:11:46] me to go is this an important thing? Is\n[02:11:48] this really important? And I have to\n[02:11:51] provide nuance there which is this\n[02:11:52] doesn't mean don't address things\n[02:11:54] >> correctly. I was just about to say\n[02:11:55] conflict is critical. You've got to\n[02:11:58] fight well,\n[02:11:59] >> but let it be me versus you and the\n[02:12:00] problem. Like me and you versus the\n[02:12:02] problem versus me just going at you.\n[02:12:04] >> Yes. You have to be fighting for each\n[02:12:06] other,\n[02:12:07] >> not fighting against each other.\n[02:12:09] >> Yeah. Exactly.\n[02:12:10] >> And that you have to try to then in that\n[02:12:12] context of Clive wearing\n[02:12:15] >> don't shy away from conflict if you need\n[02:12:17] to have the conversation. Often it's\n[02:12:20] like the gym. If you do it well, you\n[02:12:23] even on the days when you kind of go\n[02:12:25] into the gym, you think, I I don't want\n[02:12:26] to do this or I just I don't feel good,\n[02:12:29] you always come out feeling better than\n[02:12:31] you did before. And with conflict, if\n[02:12:33] you do it well, you typically, it may\n[02:12:36] not be the hour after or even the day\n[02:12:37] after, but if you do it well, you\n[02:12:39] typically are better as a couple after\n[02:12:42] than you were before the conflict as\n[02:12:44] long as you do it well. So, I'm not\n[02:12:46] saying don't have conflict. What I'm\n[02:12:48] saying is Clive Wearing's story to me of\n[02:12:53] how he loved his wife with an intent\n[02:12:55] that I'd never experienced before until\n[02:12:57] I met my much better half\n[02:13:01] prevented me from resentment.\n[02:13:04] Resentment is the barrier that will keep\n[02:13:06] you from reparation and a future of I\n[02:13:10] think equinimity.\n[02:13:12] Because when you resent someone, it\n[02:13:14] means that you haven't processed, you\n[02:13:16] haven't moved forward. And resentment\n[02:13:18] usually comes by way of I think a poor\n[02:13:21] choice of things such as did I win the\n[02:13:23] argument? Did you win the argument? It's\n[02:13:26] not about point scoring at least. And\n[02:13:28] I've done that before. I've been guilty\n[02:13:30] of all of that behavior. But now with\n[02:13:33] this person that I cherish most, you\n[02:13:36] know, I think of his lessons. It's not\n[02:13:38] that we don't have conflict. We do. It's\n[02:13:40] just that I value the person far beyond\n[02:13:43] the conflict afterwards. And I'll always\n[02:13:46] want to reach out with an olive branch\n[02:13:49] because it's not worth it. Just as you\n[02:13:50] said, when that call comes,\n[02:13:53] you know, I I think of that sometimes\n[02:13:55] when I have a bad day. Let's say\n[02:13:56] someone, you know, I come back to my car\n[02:13:59] and my car is being rearended when it's\n[02:14:01] been parked or, you know, I was coming\n[02:14:04] here to fly out and we were 4 hours on\n[02:14:08] the tarmac waiting and there's a guy in\n[02:14:11] front of me who's getting all agitated\n[02:14:13] and giving the the ground staff all\n[02:14:15] sorts of vitriol.\n[02:14:18] And I was thinking, look, when you're on\n[02:14:20] your deathbed, my good fellow, are you\n[02:14:23] going to look back at this day and\n[02:14:25] think, gosh, you know, I remember that\n[02:14:27] one day when I was on that flight coming\n[02:14:29] out to LA and it was 4 hours delayed.\n[02:14:32] No, of course you're not. So, if you're\n[02:14:35] not stressing about it when you're\n[02:14:36] dying, why are you stressing about it\n[02:14:38] now?\n[02:14:39] >> It's just not worth it.\n[02:14:42] >> Live. Thank you. Thank you so much. I\n[02:14:45] mean, I can't thank you enough for the\n[02:14:46] profound impact you've had on so many\n[02:14:48] millions of people. Um, being the the\n[02:14:52] chief torchbearer of the subject of\n[02:14:55] sleep and creating a movement around\n[02:14:57] sleep, but also a heightened awareness\n[02:14:59] of ourselves and our struggles. And that\n[02:15:01] is something that you'll never\n[02:15:02] understand. Like, you'll never\n[02:15:03] understand the full magnitude of the\n[02:15:04] many millions of people you've\n[02:15:05] positively impacted. Um, but I mean even\n[02:15:08] though you'll never get to meet them all\n[02:15:10] and you'll never get to hear all of\n[02:15:11] their thank yous, they are very very\n[02:15:14] real people and they are that the them\n[02:15:16] themselves are these little ripples\n[02:15:18] through the ocean where their children\n[02:15:19] and then the generations to come get to\n[02:15:21] sleep better and enjoy their lives and\n[02:15:23] live a happier healthier life because of\n[02:15:25] the work that you do. So it's um\n[02:15:26] incredibly important work, Matthew,\n[02:15:28] >> and I hope you long continue it and I\n[02:15:30] long continue being the conduit of this\n[02:15:32] very important information to people\n[02:15:33] like me and my audience. Couldn't\n[02:15:35] appreciate you more. Thank you so much\n[02:15:37] for saying that. I can't lay claim to\n[02:15:39] any such um uh affirmations, but I would\n[02:15:43] say that I stand on the shoulders of\n[02:15:45] giants and that um I am simply relaying\n[02:15:47] all of the incredible work of all of my\n[02:15:49] colleagues in the field and all of those\n[02:15:51] who came before me. Um I'm just the\n[02:15:53] mouthpiece and not a particularly good\n[02:15:54] one at that and for all of their work.\n[02:15:56] It's really the appreciation that I give\n[02:15:58] to them. So, thank you for giving me the\n[02:16:00] opportunity to say that.\n[02:16:06] Make sure you keep what I'm about to say\n[02:16:07] to yourself. I'm inviting 10,000 of you\n[02:16:10] to come even deeper into the dire of a\n[02:16:12] CEO. Welcome to my inner circle. This is\n[02:16:15] a brand new private community that I'm\n[02:16:17] launching to the world. We have so many\n[02:16:19] incredible things that happen that you\n[02:16:20] are never shown. We have the briefs that\n[02:16:23] are on my iPad when I'm recording the\n[02:16:24] conversation. We have clips we've never\n[02:16:26] released. We have behindthe-scenes\n[02:16:28] conversations with the guests and also\n[02:16:29] the episodes that we've never ever\n[02:16:32] released. and so much more. In the\n[02:16:35] circle, you'll have direct access to me.\n[02:16:37] You can tell us what you want this show\n[02:16:38] to be, who you want us to interview, and\n[02:16:40] the types of conversations you would\n[02:16:42] love us to have. But remember, for now,\n[02:16:44] we're only inviting the first 10,000\n[02:16:46] people that join before it closes. So,\n[02:16:49] if you want to join our private closed\n[02:16:50] community, head to the link in the\n[02:16:51] description below or go to\n[02:16:52] daccircle.com.\n[02:16:56] I will speak to you then.\n[02:17:10] Oh,\n[02:17:14] hey.",
