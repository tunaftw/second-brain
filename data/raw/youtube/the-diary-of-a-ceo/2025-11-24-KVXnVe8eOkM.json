  "transcript": "[00:00] Welcome to the sardine challenge. So,\n[00:02] the only thing on the menu for the next\n[00:03] 3 days is sardines. I challenge you to\n[00:06] try and eat three of those cans in a day\n[00:07] because that's a hell of a tool to\n[00:09] [music] help you get into a ketogenic\n[00:10] state. And when you're in a ketogenic\n[00:12] state, it helps burn fat, muscle mass\n[00:14] [music] gets higher, preserved. I've\n[00:15] seen patients that have reversed their\n[00:17] gray hair and that brain performance,\n[00:19] concentration, and energy. All of those\n[00:21] things improve. And so, I'm going to\n[00:22] teach you how to do an advanced\n[00:24] ketogenic diet.\n[00:25] >> Sorry, the sardine juice has gone on my\n[00:27] iPad. Good luck getting that off.\n[00:29] >> Dr. Annette Bosworth is the insulin\n[00:31] resistance specialist.\n[00:32] >> With over two decades of experience,\n[00:34] she's discovered that the key to your\n[00:36] health isn't [music] more treatments.\n[00:37] >> It's to get into a ketogenic state.\n[00:39] >> Most people have been making buckets of\n[00:41] insulin without knowing it. But when you\n[00:42] have excess insulin, it's a chronic\n[00:44] disease maker. It is what makes high\n[00:46] blood pressure. It is what makes cancer.\n[00:48] It is what makes debris in the brain,\n[00:50] which is linked to depression, brain\n[00:52] fog, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. And\n[00:54] so to reverse the high insulin state, I\n[00:56] really push my patients to do the\n[00:58] ketogenic diet. And what unfolds is your\n[01:01] best life ahead within a year. Like I\n[01:03] really rescued my mom from the edge of\n[01:05] death.\n[01:06] >> So where do I start?\n[01:07] >> First thing is quit eating so late at\n[01:08] night because you're stimulating an\n[01:10] excessive [music] production of insulin.\n[01:11] The next thing keep the carbs low, put\n[01:13] the fat up, more eggs, beef, brisket,\n[01:15] ribs, pork belly.\n[01:16] >> But then people often say when you talk\n[01:18] about the ketogenic diet that it's not\n[01:19] sustainable. So you have this idea of\n[01:21] this keto continuum consistently. Keto\n[01:24] for life.\n[01:24] >> Yeah. I mean, I've been on a ketogenic\n[01:26] diet for 10 years, and there's 12 steps\n[01:28] for it, and you're not going to have to\n[01:29] try very hard. So, the first step is\n[01:32] >> I see messages all the time in the\n[01:34] comment section that some of you didn't\n[01:36] realize you didn't subscribe. So, if you\n[01:37] could do me a favor and double check if\n[01:39] you're a subscriber to this channel,\n[01:40] that would be tremendously appreciated.\n[01:42] It's the simple, it's the free thing\n[01:44] that anybody that watches this show\n[01:45] frequently can do to help us here to\n[01:47] keep everything going in this show in\n[01:48] the trajectory it's on. So please do\n[01:50] double check if you've subscribed and uh\n[01:52] thank you so much because in a strange\n[01:54] way you are you're part of our history\n[01:56] and you're on this journey with us and I\n[01:58] appreciate you for that. So yeah thank\n[01:59] you\n[02:01] [music]\n[02:03] Dr. Annette Bosworth or should I call\n[02:06] you Dr. Bos.\n[02:08] What is it that you know and believe and\n[02:11] understand that you think the general\n[02:12] public doesn't know believe and\n[02:14] understand?\n[02:16] that most of the reasons people come to\n[02:18] see me could be reversed if they knew\n[02:21] how to make ketones on a regular basis.\n[02:24] So, I'm an internist. Uh that means uh\n[02:27] if you go to an internal medicine doctor\n[02:28] and we don't know what's wrong, you're\n[02:30] going to die. We take care of tough\n[02:33] puzzles and we do this over long\n[02:35] management, chronic disease management.\n[02:38] So, I've got 25 years of studying\n[02:40] chronic problems that deteriorate the\n[02:44] quality of life. Lifespan, health span,\n[02:46] both go in the toilet when you're\n[02:47] chronically seeing me. And you could\n[02:50] abort all of that destiny if routinely\n[02:54] you were making ketones.\n[02:56] >> An internist sounds like an intern. I'm\n[02:58] trying to understand\n[03:00] the marketing on this is terrible. It\n[03:01] just means you're supposed to take care\n[03:03] of very complex answers. Your job I mean\n[03:05] the buck stops with you. If if the\n[03:07] internal medicine team can't figure it\n[03:08] out, you're going to die.\n[03:10] >> So So you're basically a chronic illness\n[03:12] doctor.\n[03:12] >> Chronic disease management is absolutely\n[03:14] it. You know, I love the way uh Peter\n[03:17] Aia uses medicine 2.0, which is what we\n[03:19] are the masters of managing it, making\n[03:21] sure the prescriptions are there, making\n[03:23] sure you are treating all these\n[03:25] problems. The internist being one of\n[03:27] your best buddies cuz you're having to\n[03:29] see them routinely. You got to get the\n[03:30] meds refilled. You got to check for the\n[03:32] side effects. It's a mill.\n[03:33] >> What is medicine 2.0 in your definition?\n[03:36] Yeah. So, I can keep you from dying from\n[03:38] childbirth and infections. And I have an\n[03:41] antidote for every one of your symptoms.\n[03:43] We are in a world where medicine has\n[03:45] answered a lot of problems. Little\n[03:46] things like high blood pressure. Little\n[03:48] things like it's a few extra pounds\n[03:50] around the middle. Little things like\n[03:52] brain fog. Oh, my eyes are aging. All of\n[03:55] these are signals that your body has\n[03:58] made more trash than it cleaned up. And\n[04:00] there were some rules to humans that you\n[04:03] missed. And for for my listeners that\n[04:05] have clicked on this conversation,\n[04:08] what are they going to get out of giving\n[04:09] us their time and staying with us and\n[04:12] listening to this? What is the end goal\n[04:13] going to be for them in their lives?\n[04:15] >> Listening to the way I talk to my\n[04:17] patients and teach them the steps how to\n[04:20] reverse the medical problems that you've\n[04:22] already got on the roster. And by doing\n[04:25] that, the freedom is to be the kind of\n[04:28] grandparent that you dreamt of, but\n[04:30] you've surrendered can't be there\n[04:31] anymore.\n[04:32] And what is the list of predicaments or\n[04:35] illnesses that\n[04:36] >> yeah are relevant here?\n[04:37] >> Most common one is being overweight and\n[04:39] a brain that's not working right. What\n[04:41] really is behind all of the patients\n[04:43] I've seen for 25 years is we're working\n[04:46] on peak brain performance. Even if you\n[04:47] don't think about that, that's what I\n[04:49] think about. So when you come in and\n[04:51] you're 55 years old and I can see the\n[04:54] worry of Parkinson's headed your way,\n[04:56] super young is 55 years old with\n[04:57] Parkinson's. That is a brain that's got\n[05:00] too much trash and you don't know it\n[05:02] yet. And I mean in the history of Dr.\n[05:06] Bos versus Parkinson's, Parkinson's has\n[05:08] like 3,500 patients. I have zero.\n[05:11] Parkinson's wins every time. And the the\n[05:14] biggest moment of people who have\n[05:16] chronic problems under the hood is they\n[05:18] have no idea that it's coming. And once\n[05:21] that lands, the reversal is much worse.\n[05:24] seeing it 10 years before it's supposed\n[05:25] to be there. This is a gift of saying,\n[05:28] \"Let me show you how to undo that. Back\n[05:30] away from the edge.\" It's that brain\n[05:32] function that you're going to miss the\n[05:34] most when it doesn't work. And it's\n[05:36] linked to all of these things like the\n[05:38] arthritis, the, you know, weight around\n[05:40] the middle, the high blood pressure, the\n[05:43] severe uh connection to mental\n[05:46] uh approach, meaning you can say\n[05:48] depression, but people say, \"Oh, I don't\n[05:49] have that diagnosis.\" I'm talking about\n[05:51] a brain that doesn't want to engage,\n[05:53] that doesn't find joy in their life\n[05:54] anymore because it's been too many years\n[05:57] since they took out the trash. Let me\n[05:59] show you how to take out the trash. And\n[06:00] you're going to have to do it a few\n[06:01] times, but what unfolds is your best\n[06:05] life ahead within a year.\n[06:06] >> So, you're going to teach me how to take\n[06:08] out the trash.\n[06:08] >> Yeah.\n[06:09] >> The trash in my own brain.\n[06:10] >> Yep.\n[06:11] >> And if I take out the trash in my own\n[06:12] brain, how is my life going to be\n[06:13] better? You live in the 21st century\n[06:15] where there's lots of processed foods\n[06:17] and lots of ways that your body did\n[06:19] things without telling you. So any\n[06:21] injury that you've had, like a joint\n[06:22] injury that keeps coming back every time\n[06:24] you injure it, it it is a little easier\n[06:26] to injure the next time. Is there a ring\n[06:29] around the middle that's more more than\n[06:31] pinch an inch? Is there a uh distance in\n[06:37] time where you say, \"I can focus for\n[06:38] this many hours, but I can't do it for\n[06:40] this many hours anymore.\" Those are all\n[06:42] places where if you did this, if you\n[06:45] were able to say, \"Don't stop taking out\n[06:47] the trash.\" Several times a year,\n[06:48] several times a month, if you ask me,\n[06:50] then you never have to come into this\n[06:53] world that I just see people, they're\n[06:55] they're in quicksand. They're up to\n[06:56] their waist and getting them out. They\n[06:59] need a real lifeline. And what are the\n[07:01] current solutions people are typically\n[07:02] offered when they're feeling, you know,\n[07:04] all the the ways that you described\n[07:06] there where they just don't feel good,\n[07:08] they have brain fog, they're they might\n[07:10] have chronic pain setting in in various\n[07:11] ways. What are the typical solutions\n[07:13] that medicine 2.0 would offer them?\n[07:15] >> Yeah, especially if they have good\n[07:16] insurance.\n[07:17] >> Yeah,\n[07:17] >> that doctor is going to be with the\n[07:19] covered insurance plan and he's going to\n[07:21] say, \"Tell me the symptoms. I have a\n[07:24] matching game. I will give you the drugs\n[07:26] that will take away that one and take\n[07:27] away that one and take away that one.\"\n[07:30] What is always a downside is well play\n[07:33] that forward for 10 years. Play it\n[07:34] forward for five years and are the\n[07:36] symptoms gone? No. But it will bridge\n[07:38] and hold up the architecture of the body\n[07:40] and the human without actually fixing\n[07:43] the problem, without actually diving in\n[07:45] and say you got some chemistry problems\n[07:47] under the hood that you don't measure\n[07:49] and you don't talk about. But if you\n[07:51] did, even if you're not perfect, even if\n[07:53] you're 70%,\n[07:55] you're going to find yourself at the age\n[07:58] of 54 with vitality and energy and\n[08:01] sleeping through the night and not\n[08:02] having what every other 54year-old,\n[08:04] which is chronic joint pain, a brain\n[08:06] that can only focus for 3 to four hours\n[08:08] without a break. Uh, a stamina of\n[08:12] endurance and health and and joy that\n[08:15] falls apart.\n[08:16] >> So, when I'm You're 54 years old. When\n[08:18] I'm 54 years old, I want to be as\n[08:21] young and energetic and articulate and\n[08:24] cognitively astute as you are. So, what\n[08:28] should I be doing now to make sure that\n[08:30] I don't decline decay in all those areas\n[08:33] I described?\n[08:34] >> Well, what did you have for breakfast\n[08:35] >> today?\n[08:36] >> Yeah.\n[08:37] >> Um, I have not eaten breakfast yet.\n[08:39] >> It's okay. That's not a bad thing. But,\n[08:42] uh, when you're 54, you should probably\n[08:43] put the calories in the morning, not at\n[08:45] night.\n[08:46] We know that as you age, the cost of a\n[08:49] calorie turns into timing. If you eat\n[08:53] that food, one bite of food after 6:00\n[08:56] is worth 10 bites of food before noon.\n[09:00] So, if you're trying to say, \"How do I\n[09:01] get the best out of the nourishment, but\n[09:03] also eating's fun?\" If you only get one\n[09:05] bite after 6:00 and 10 before, move that\n[09:09] food towards morning. When you're your\n[09:12] age, uh, what did you have for what's\n[09:13] the last meal you ate\n[09:15] >> yesterday?\n[09:16] >> Yeah.\n[09:16] >> Uh, for dinner, I had this cod and I had\n[09:20] salad. I also had pasta.\n[09:23] >> Okay.\n[09:24] >> But I ate pretty late, which is\n[09:26] >> What did you have the rest of the day\n[09:27] before that? Was that your first salad?\n[09:29] >> Just a big salad.\n[09:30] >> Was that more towards lunch or noon or\n[09:33] >> probably about 4:00?\n[09:34] >> So, waited all the way till 4:00 to eat.\n[09:36] Very common. This is a really common\n[09:37] pattern of people doing what we would\n[09:39] say intermittent or timerestricted\n[09:41] eating. They put that eating window in\n[09:43] this, but it's got that balloon at the\n[09:45] end of the day.\n[09:45] >> Yeah.\n[09:46] >> And it really does I mean what you're\n[09:48] stimulating is an excessive production\n[09:50] of insulin\n[09:52] >> and you're going to wake up the next\n[09:53] morning. What time did you wake up this\n[09:54] morning?\n[09:55] >> Today\n[09:56] >> I went to bed fairly relatively early\n[09:58] for me. I woke up at about 7:30 a.m. Oh.\n[10:01] >> Usually it's later. And do you have did\n[10:03] you have a solid seven eight hours of\n[10:05] sleep or how?\n[10:07] >> Yeah.\n[10:07] >> So during that time uh you finished\n[10:09] eating around 10 o'clock then it sounds\n[10:11] like\n[10:11] >> Yeah.\n[10:12] >> Okay. So then it's 7\n[10:13] >> bit later.\n[10:14] >> Okay. So 11:00 and you've got uh 7 7:30\n[10:17] in the morning is when you woke up. So\n[10:18] that's about 8 hours since you've eaten.\n[10:20] Your insulin is still churning\n[10:22] especially if the meal was large and\n[10:24] there was carbs in it. So now you've got\n[10:26] these processed foods late at night and\n[10:28] you're at the beginning of the disease,\n[10:29] right? you're at the beginning of the\n[10:31] chronic inflammatory churn of how do you\n[10:34] age faster and faster? You don't do\n[10:36] that. You don't have high insulin\n[10:37] throughout the night.\n[10:39] >> So, can you explain to me like I'm a\n[10:40] 12-year-old what insulin is and the role\n[10:43] it's playing because you know I guess\n[10:45] we're focused here on how to I guess\n[10:47] longevity aging.\n[10:49] >> Yeah.\n[10:49] >> For a second, but how does insulin play\n[10:50] a role in all of this and what is\n[10:51] insulin?\n[10:52] >> So, insulin insulates. Okay. So, think\n[10:56] of it as it makes you fluffy. It makes\n[10:58] you it puts the fat on. Uh it's got some\n[11:01] other roles too, but we're going to talk\n[11:02] about chronic diseases here where it's\n[11:05] not a scarcity problem. You you make\n[11:07] plenty of it. And when it's in excess,\n[11:10] it will store energy for when you go\n[11:13] through a famine. It will also cause you\n[11:16] to grow. Now, grow means get a little\n[11:19] fatter, but it also means things like\n[11:21] their skin gets a little thicker. They\n[11:24] have skin tags. And what I always think\n[11:27] about is what's going on in their brain.\n[11:28] And when that insulin is high for years\n[11:31] and years and years, uh, just like\n[11:33] yours, because if if you didn't eat the\n[11:35] rest of today and then you got up\n[11:37] tomorrow morning, it would be about that\n[11:39] long after a late meal last night,\n[11:42] that's how long it would take you to\n[11:44] say, \"Okay, we're back down to where we\n[11:47] started from or where we should be in\n[11:48] the morning.\"\n[11:48] >> For someone that's never heard the word\n[11:50] insulin before, there's some context to\n[11:52] give on in terms of what it's doing. So\n[11:53] it's coming out like a transporter in\n[11:55] helping put away the sugar or deal with\n[11:57] the excess sugar.\n[11:58] >> Right. So it is what lifts Yeah. It\n[12:00] lifts glucose or sugar from the\n[12:02] circulation into a cell. That's its\n[12:04] first primary job.\n[12:06] >> But if all the cells are full, their\n[12:08] storage is full, it's going to start to\n[12:10] pack it into the liver. I mean, let's\n[12:11] say all those stores are full too. This\n[12:14] job uh of the of insulin, this hormone\n[12:17] oozes into every part of your body to\n[12:20] say make sure it's got f fuel. Make sure\n[12:22] it's got that sugar. But most people are\n[12:25] like what I would guess you are. Most of\n[12:27] the time you don't you aren't a shortage\n[12:29] of sugar. And so it feel it tops things\n[12:31] off and then it will turn things into\n[12:33] fat. It's too much sugar. They can't\n[12:36] store it. All the storage is full. So\n[12:37] you can send the signal out. Make me\n[12:39] some more cells. I need some more\n[12:40] storage units. This guy's eating more\n[12:42] than he thinks he is. And we're going to\n[12:44] be prepared to live through the famine.\n[12:49] But in the meantime, turn it into fat.\n[12:51] make him a little fluffier.\n[12:52] >> Is that the only consequence of high\n[12:54] insulin is that I'm gonna I might be a\n[12:56] bit more fat.\n[12:57] >> No, that's just the one people hear\n[12:58] about the most. When you look at chronic\n[13:00] disease management, it is the growth of\n[13:04] of the diseases of the inflammation.\n[13:06] It's the making of the trash. So, I keep\n[13:09] saying, you know, you you need to take\n[13:10] the trash out routinely, which means\n[13:12] that insulin, which has been smoldering\n[13:14] higher than you think it is because you\n[13:16] live in today's world, because you eat\n[13:18] processed food, because you eat super\n[13:19] late at night, uh you don't go two to\n[13:21] three days without eating. You've you've\n[13:23] got storage filled in your body. The\n[13:25] high insulin levels in a healthy person\n[13:28] hides that the debris is being made and\n[13:31] you don't know it.\n[13:32] >> It hides it.\n[13:34] >> Yeah. It's going to put it in between\n[13:35] two cells in your brain. It's going to\n[13:37] go in between the skin cells. The trash\n[13:40] doesn't get taken out until the insulin\n[13:42] gets lower. And unfortunately, most\n[13:46] people have been making buckets of\n[13:48] insulin without [clears throat] knowing\n[13:48] it.\n[13:49] >> Why? What are they doing to create\n[13:52] buckets of insulin? all the things you\n[13:53] said about\n[13:54] >> carbs, um um foods that comes from boxes\n[13:57] and barcodes and uh bags instead of\n[14:01] whole foods instead of a fatforward\n[14:04] diet, which would then push that body\n[14:06] into making ketones. So, you can't you\n[14:10] cannot make a ketone if your insulin's\n[14:13] high.\n[14:14] >> Are there any signs that I might have\n[14:17] high levels of insulin or insulin\n[14:18] resistance? Abdominal girth is the first\n[14:21] thing that is the first place that the\n[14:22] fat goes. So you do this really great\n[14:24] part where you don't eat until later in\n[14:26] the day.\n[14:27] >> How does that feel during the day?\n[14:29] >> During the day I feel really focused. I\n[14:31] actually don't even know that I'm not\n[14:32] eating.\n[14:32] >> So that's really good. So what I would\n[14:33] love to know is show me what your blood\n[14:35] sugars are doing during the day and show\n[14:37] me if you make ketones. That'll be the\n[14:39] answer is you when you have excess\n[14:42] insulin which is this chronic disease\n[14:45] maker. Uh it is what makes cancer. It is\n[14:48] what makes high blood pressure. It is\n[14:50] what makes debris in the brain where\n[14:52] call it depression or brain fog or\n[14:54] Parkinson's. It's the aging of the\n[14:56] brain.\n[14:57] >> It's linked to all of those things.\n[14:58] >> All of those things. And that excess\n[15:00] insulin nobody tells you about. But the\n[15:03] symptoms are, dang, I feel like I got to\n[15:05] eat every two to three hours. Uh their\n[15:07] debris uh or their fuel keeps running\n[15:09] out. When you say, boy, I can eat uh\n[15:13] once at the end of the day and I'm\n[15:14] pretty good. My focus stays really good.\n[15:16] What I want you to prove is what are\n[15:18] your ketones during the day. So when\n[15:21] when you've got a patient who has done\n[15:23] that, their ketones will be 7 1.0\n[15:28] and they're taking out the trash all day\n[15:30] long.\n[15:31] >> So there's these two energy sources. One\n[15:33] of them is the glucose. One of them's\n[15:34] which is from like you know eating pasta\n[15:36] which I ate last night. Um so that\n[15:38] probably put a lot of glucose in my my\n[15:39] blood. I probably had a high glucose\n[15:41] spike and then insulin came out to deal\n[15:42] with that. And then there's ketones,\n[15:44] which start to appear when I'm fasting\n[15:47] or when I haven't been eating carbs for\n[15:49] a while and my body's looking for an\n[15:50] energy source.\n[15:51] >> Yeah. When\n[15:52] >> in terms of these two energy sources,\n[15:56] >> there seems to be a lot of hype around\n[15:57] ketones.\n[15:58] >> Mhm.\n[15:59] >> So, why doesn't our body just run off\n[16:01] ketones?\n[16:02] >> It will as soon as you're done lowering\n[16:04] your insulin. And I mean, insulin grew\n[16:07] in these patients. They didn't know that\n[16:09] it was growing high. They went to their\n[16:11] blood test and their glucose looked\n[16:12] normal. What nobody checked for years is\n[16:15] how much of that insulating hormone did\n[16:17] it take to keep the glucose controlled.\n[16:19] And that's where chronic diseases are\n[16:21] are grown in spades. That's where\n[16:23] autoimmune disorder\n[16:24] >> the insulating hormone being insulin.\n[16:25] >> Yes. Okay.\n[16:26] >> So that excess insulin for the last\n[16:28] decade had you come into my clinic.\n[16:31] We'll put a label on it. Call it PCOS.\n[16:33] Call it uh high blood pressure. Call it\n[16:36] um autoimmune problems. All of them are\n[16:39] linked to high insulin. Glucose, when\n[16:41] you want to store it, we put it in a\n[16:43] fancy string called glycogen. And it's\n[16:45] just an efficient way to store glucose,\n[16:47] but as soon as your body needs it, it\n[16:49] will unlock all that sugar back into\n[16:51] your access back for you.\n[16:53] >> Mhm.\n[16:53] >> What you don't realize is, well, how\n[16:55] much glycogen you got stored over there?\n[16:58] How much is there in storage? And that\n[17:00] is what high insulin has been doing.\n[17:02] Just put it in storage. Put it in\n[17:03] storage. And then when you stop eating,\n[17:07] you'll know if you emptied out all your\n[17:09] stored sugar, which is some of the\n[17:11] regular sugar you just ate, but then all\n[17:13] this glycogen, this packaged sugar. How\n[17:16] empty are you? I don't know. Have you\n[17:18] made a ketone yet? You cannot make a\n[17:20] ketone. You cannot burn fat until that\n[17:23] that tank is empty.\n[17:24] >> Okay. So, I have these glycogen stores\n[17:26] which last for what, a day or two?\n[17:28] >> Oh, no. Think of it as brown sugar. So\n[17:31] you package the sugar really tight and\n[17:33] then you put it in the back of the\n[17:34] drawer and it turned crusty because you\n[17:36] never lowered your insulin. I have\n[17:38] patients that are over overweight and we\n[17:40] put them on a ketogenic we put them on a\n[17:42] 20 total carbohydrates per day. So super\n[17:44] low carbohydrate. It is 15 days before\n[17:48] they make a ketone.\n[17:49] >> Okay? So it's it could be a a one it\n[17:51] could be up to two weeks for example\n[17:53] before my glycogen stores are empty. And\n[17:55] it's not until my glycogen stores my\n[17:56] glucose stores are empty that my body\n[17:58] can start producing ketones.\n[18:00] >> Correct. So, it's going to exhaust all\n[18:01] of those glycogen stores and then once\n[18:03] it's ran out, it's going to switch into\n[18:05] this ketogenic state,\n[18:06] >> right? Yeah. So, think of it as your\n[18:09] shortterm easy to access sugar has to\n[18:12] decrease and that means your insulin has\n[18:15] decreased. That hormone for insulate.\n[18:18] They both run in tangents. You decre\n[18:20] you're emptying glycogen, your insulin's\n[18:22] going down.\n[18:22] >> So, how do I know if I have insulin\n[18:26] resistance? What what are the key signs?\n[18:27] You mentioned skin tags. I've never\n[18:28] heard that term before. Yeah, skin tags\n[18:30] are not moles. So moles, you can feel\n[18:33] this bump on your on your skin, right?\n[18:35] >> But a skin tag has a neck and like a\n[18:38] little mushroom.\n[18:39] >> And it's the most annoying thing when\n[18:41] patients come and say, \"Well, I just\n[18:42] tried to cut them all off, but they kept\n[18:44] bleeding.\" I'm like, \"Do not cut them\n[18:46] off.\" They'll fall off when your\n[18:49] insulin's lower. So that's the first\n[18:51] place. It'll be found in their armpits\n[18:52] or places where their skin rubs. So\n[18:54] armpits and they're growing. And once\n[18:56] insulin starts to grow them, it's like a\n[18:58] crop. a crop of little baby cauliflower\n[19:00] hanging out in their armpits.\n[19:01] >> You talked about velvety skin.\n[19:03] >> Yes.\n[19:04] >> As well being an indicator.\n[19:05] >> Velvety skin is this Latin word\n[19:07] aanthosis nigraans which is fancy word\n[19:10] that means the skin is darker and\n[19:13] thicker. So the the places that usually\n[19:15] happens is the back of the neck. And\n[19:17] you'll hear you know stories of I tried\n[19:20] to wash my neck. It's it's dirty all the\n[19:22] time. It's not dirt. It is the way the\n[19:24] skin is under the the curse of high\n[19:28] insulin. And you see it in teenagers all\n[19:30] the time now. They put on weight and\n[19:32] their growth hormones are already doing\n[19:34] that teenage thing. Now you put high\n[19:37] insulin in there and they have this\n[19:39] dirty neck syndrome or on the creases of\n[19:41] their elbow. It's just darker here. Uh\n[19:44] that is pathology that's not normal from\n[19:47] high insulin.\n[19:48] >> You talked about weight changes as well.\n[19:50] What's this thing about hairy toes that\n[19:52] I was reading about?\n[19:53] >> Right. So, as my patients age, so most\n[19:55] my 55year-olds that have had high\n[19:57] insulin, I will tell them, \"Look at your\n[19:59] toes. They're supposed to have hair on\n[20:01] them.\" And when your body has had that\n[20:05] high insulin state for a couple of\n[20:06] decades now, it will start to say, \"We\n[20:10] don't send resources to a couple parts\n[20:11] of the body anymore.\" And the follicles\n[20:13] in their toe are one of them. Like, just\n[20:16] stop growing hair on your toes. And\n[20:17] there's an ascending problem with this\n[20:19] where the toe starts, then it's the\n[20:21] ankles, then it's up to the knees. and\n[20:23] they don't have hair anywhere on their\n[20:24] lower extremities. It is a process\n[20:28] that started from high insulin.\n[20:29] >> What about aging? You talked about how\n[20:32] if you have high insulin, there'll be an\n[20:34] impact on your aging. Now, I'm thinking\n[20:36] about, you know, I'm getting a couple\n[20:37] gray hairs now. I'm thinking, [laughter]\n[20:38] this is because of my insulin levels. I\n[20:40] >> I have seen patients that have reversed\n[20:42] their gray hair on a ketogenic diet. It\n[20:44] blew my mind. They asked me for the\n[20:46] reason why that happened, and I thought,\n[20:48] well, um the cells are healthier that\n[20:51] are making your hair. That's all I got.\n[20:53] Um, aging is exactly that enemy, which\n[20:57] is they are going around the sun with\n[21:00] more growing of the trash than they\n[21:03] needed. So that high insulin, they don't\n[21:05] know about it. They've not produced a\n[21:07] ketone in years. And that chronic\n[21:09] disease is now difficult to get their\n[21:13] the eye to clean out. It's difficult to\n[21:15] get that brain trash removed. And you're\n[21:19] supposed to do it every night when you\n[21:20] sleep. is not supposed to be behind this\n[21:22] far. You're two decades from taking out\n[21:24] the trash in your brain. That's aging.\n[21:26] >> How do I for a start even know my ketone\n[21:30] blood levels?\n[21:31] >> Well, when when a patient first comes in\n[21:33] saying, \"How do I begin?\" I want them to\n[21:36] tell me what they had for their meal and\n[21:37] then say, \"How many carbs do you think\n[21:39] that was?\" Because this education like\n[21:42] an apple is 20 gram of carbs, 15 grams\n[21:44] of carbs for some of them. And we're\n[21:47] going to ask you in the first six weeks\n[21:50] to take your carb intake down to less\n[21:52] than 20. 20 total grams of carbohydrates\n[21:54] or less is where we begin. And again, I\n[21:58] do this in a medical grade. There are\n[21:59] people who play with a ketogenic diet\n[22:00] and there's people who try to reverse\n[22:02] medical problems with a ketogenic diet.\n[22:04] >> In order to do this, it is not a lazy\n[22:06] kind of keto. You have to actually be on\n[22:08] the same team as me using data to\n[22:11] reverse this medical problem.\n[22:12] >> And how how does one measure their blood\n[22:15] ketone levels? Yeah, I I think blood is\n[22:17] the best. There is a way you can measure\n[22:19] them in a in urine. The burning of fat\n[22:22] if you turn that string of fat into\n[22:26] ketones, there are two destinies for\n[22:27] that. You either put it into a\n[22:29] mitochondria and turn it into energy or\n[22:31] you pee it out. So, especially when\n[22:33] they're early in a ketogenic journey,\n[22:36] they're they overshoot. Evolution said,\n[22:38] \"Don't let them die. Turn that fat into\n[22:41] energy. Help them through the famine.\"\n[22:43] So the excess ketones they make end up\n[22:46] in their urine. We call them ketone\n[22:48] strips and they're cheap and easy and we\n[22:50] don't have to cross that barrier of\n[22:52] somebody pricking their finger at the\n[22:53] beginning. So they're going to pee out\n[22:55] ketones every day\n[22:59] as long as they're not chronic insulin\n[23:01] resistant.\n[23:02] >> So if I avoid carbs for a sustained\n[23:05] period of time, which could be a couple\n[23:06] of days, it could be up to two weeks,\n[23:08] eventually my body's going to say,\n[23:09] \"Listen, we need energy.\" So it's going\n[23:11] to start burning my fat stores. Yes,\n[23:13] >> you know, from some of that fat around\n[23:15] the midsection, and it's going to start\n[23:17] turning that into ketones, which are a\n[23:20] different type of energy. Are there any\n[23:23] reasons why ketone as a source of energy\n[23:26] is better for me in terms of performance\n[23:29] other than the insulin reasons that\n[23:31] we've talked about? Like, are there any\n[23:33] other parts of my body or my health that\n[23:35] benefit [snorts]\n[23:36] >> ketones? For starters, when you're\n[23:37] burning a ketone, there's less trash.\n[23:39] Okay? It is a cleaner uh fuel with less\n[23:43] byproduct especially as you age. So you\n[23:45] get the longer energy and you have less\n[23:47] debris floating around. You hear the\n[23:48] word antioxidants all the time. Well,\n[23:51] burning ketones is an antioxidant state.\n[23:54] It is a and it's in the space where you\n[23:57] need it, which is inside that cell. Uh\n[23:59] you swallow antioxidants and you have no\n[24:02] guarantee that they end up where they're\n[24:03] supposed to. So number one, the fuel is\n[24:07] reducing trash at a cellular level. It\n[24:09] lasts longer and it penetrates through\n[24:13] that bloodb brain barrier to fuel a\n[24:15] brain that even if it's insulin\n[24:18] resistant, it can use a ketone. So the\n[24:21] problem with somebody who's chronic\n[24:23] insulin resistance, their brain needs a\n[24:26] lot of glucose to stay on online.\n[24:29] and I can try to get it there, but\n[24:31] insulin is constantly fighting that.\n[24:33] It's a war to try and keep the glucose\n[24:35] in their brain. My hack is ketones will\n[24:39] go right around that. It doesn't need\n[24:41] the same transporters to get across the\n[24:42] bloodb brain barrier and especially to\n[24:44] fuel those cells in the brain. So, for\n[24:47] performance, um I mean, name a game\n[24:49] where you don't use your brain. There\n[24:52] isn't one, right? you're you're gonna if\n[24:54] you're looking at performance to say\n[24:55] let's begin with the sharpest brains and\n[24:57] the most focus, the most discipline, the\n[24:59] less um impulsivity.\n[25:02] All of those things improve when that\n[25:04] brain is being fueled with ketones.\n[25:06] >> So, let's focus on the brain part then.\n[25:08] So, what have you personally noticed as\n[25:11] someone who I assume is in the ketogenic\n[25:13] diet right now?\n[25:13] >> Yes.\n[25:14] >> What have you noticed the variances\n[25:16] between when you're in a keto diet and\n[25:17] when you're not?\n[25:18] >> Right. Well, I've been doing this since\n[25:20] 2015. So, um, the onset of it was really\n[25:23] messy, but, uh, the seasons where I\n[25:25] would do a great job and then I would\n[25:28] think, h, I'm fine. Uh, I mean, I can\n[25:31] tell you, you see 25 patients in a day\n[25:33] and I feel bad for the last [laughter]\n[25:35] five. Uh, they've got a they've got a\n[25:38] sluggish brain. I don't care how much\n[25:39] coffee you've got in you, you can't keep\n[25:41] that focus for that length of time. um\n[25:44] when you're in a ketogenic state and not\n[25:46] in a ketogenic state, uh the the the\n[25:49] brain power, the concentration, the\n[25:50] ability to keep your mood controlled is\n[25:53] is just it is a night and day difference\n[25:56] for most people, but I think especially\n[25:58] for me like uh and pretty high energy\n[26:01] and when it runs out, I get crabby. Uh\n[26:03] and that's not a good place to be if\n[26:05] you're the patient. Yeah, I think I've\n[26:07] noticed that as a podcaster, but I've\n[26:08] also heard a lot of very well-known\n[26:10] podcasters say the same thing, which is\n[26:12] the variance in their ability to speak\n[26:14] and articulate themselves and think and\n[26:15] sit here for three to four hours having\n[26:17] a conversation\n[26:18] >> is night and day when they are in a\n[26:20] fasted ketogenic state versus or on a\n[26:22] ketogenic diet versus when they are in a\n[26:25] higher carb diet.\n[26:27] >> And it's so profound to me that I that I\n[26:29] almost wonder why like more people don't\n[26:31] >> Oh, it's it's insane. Like one of the\n[26:33] best things that I've done in 25 years\n[26:35] was I went out on a limb and said, \"I'm\n[26:37] going to try and teach 200 people at\n[26:39] once how to do this intense ketogenic\n[26:42] diet for 3 weeks.\" Uh it is hardcore.\n[26:45] This is not playtime. You're checking\n[26:47] your numbers every day and you're\n[26:48] comparing them to your classmates. And\n[26:51] what you get to see in this class of 200\n[26:53] people going with an extreme ketogenic\n[26:55] diet is the testimony you just said. I\n[26:58] cannot believe how good I feel. By the\n[27:00] end of three weeks, they're naming\n[27:02] babies after me. They [laughter] they\n[27:04] think this is a miracle. And I'm like,\n[27:07] exactly. I mean, when you do it in a\n[27:10] group like that, I don't need to\n[27:12] advertise. They tell their friends. They\n[27:13] tell their like if you want to be on a\n[27:15] ketogenic diet, that really wakes up\n[27:17] your brain that I didn't think I could\n[27:18] do this. I thought I was too old for\n[27:20] this level of energy. And it's there\n[27:22] within 3 weeks of doing it, right? How\n[27:25] long does it typically take on average\n[27:27] for someone to feel those brain benefits\n[27:30] from doing the ketogenic diet?\n[27:32] >> Typically, how long does it take you?\n[27:34] >> Me?\n[27:34] >> Yeah.\n[27:35] >> I rarely go out of it. Meaning I I might\n[27:37] have a couple of days where I fly to LA\n[27:39] and have a fancy meal and then I need to\n[27:41] be back on it. It just doesn't feel good\n[27:42] anymore.\n[27:43] >> So, but let's go let's go to when I was\n[27:45] overweight. Okay. So, you say, who's\n[27:48] insulin resistant? Any person who's had\n[27:50] a baby. Okay. You have to be insulin\n[27:52] resistant to hold that baby for nine\n[27:54] months. Okay, so I had three of them and\n[27:56] then the weight never came off on that\n[27:57] third one. So here is an insulin\n[27:59] resistant person at 40 something years\n[28:01] old and I am probably 60 lbs heavier\n[28:05] than I am now. In the first time it it I\n[28:09] tried to get into a state of ketosis for\n[28:12] like nine months. I was about to give up\n[28:14] on like why can I not pee a ketone? Why\n[28:17] does every I mean I'm a doctor. I'm\n[28:19] trying to use this for my brain\n[28:20] patients, but I'm afraid to tell them\n[28:22] about it cuz I [clears throat]\n[28:23] personally cannot keep pee a ketone. I\n[28:26] mean, I was trying to follow 50 carbs,\n[28:28] then I tried to do 30 carbs, and then I\n[28:30] try to do none. But I just couldn't make\n[28:32] it long enough into that ketogenic\n[28:34] state. And what had happened is at least\n[28:36] a decade of high insulin, three babies,\n[28:39] full practice, busy life, you know, on\n[28:41] call, those kinds of things that are all\n[28:43] dangerous if you're going to try to have\n[28:44] a peak brain.\n[28:46] I took my kids on a um 22-mile hike\n[28:50] around the city uh on Memorial Day in\n[28:54] the name of troops as mental health and\n[28:56] I said if I am not peeing a ketone after\n[28:59] walking 22 miles having fasted for a day\n[29:03] then I'm for sure that this diet is a\n[29:04] hoie. So that's how much energy it took\n[29:07] for me to pee a ketone because I was\n[29:09] very insulin resistant. I had been\n[29:11] making excess insulin for a decade and\n[29:13] I'm a doctor. I I should have known that\n[29:15] my sugars were fine. My hemoglobin A1C\n[29:18] wasn't bad. But that excess insulin,\n[29:20] that stored sugar, that stored glycogen,\n[29:23] it took forever to get that low. And\n[29:26] only after I fasted and then walked 22\n[29:30] miles did I pee a ketone. So I when you\n[29:32] ask the question, how long does it take?\n[29:35] I don't make a I do a much better job\n[29:36] now of telling people how to get there\n[29:38] cuz I I almost gave up thinking this is\n[29:41] junk science. If you if you were to eat\n[29:43] a high carb meal now and take a couple\n[29:45] of days off, how long would it take you\n[29:46] to get back into a ketogenic state where\n[29:48] you have those brain benefits now?\n[29:50] >> Uh I could probably flip back in within\n[29:52] 12 hours.\n[29:53] >> So that's how long it roughly takes for\n[29:55] someone who's got a bit in better\n[29:57] metabolic shape. It will take a couple\n[29:59] of days.\n[30:00] >> Mhm.\n[30:00] >> Um\n[30:02] is there a downside to living in ketosis\n[30:05] the whole time? Because people often say\n[30:07] when you talk about the ketogenic diet\n[30:08] that it's not sustainable. Yeah, I hear\n[30:11] that a lot, but I have thousands of\n[30:13] patients that have been doing it for\n[30:14] years. And what happens is uh as soon as\n[30:18] they exit from the ketogenic diet and\n[30:21] they start to feel the trash build up\n[30:23] again, meaning the joints that didn't\n[30:25] hurt forever now hurt, the vision that\n[30:28] was super clear is now foggy again. The\n[30:30] brain that wasn't irritable and\n[30:32] depressive is back to doing those things\n[30:34] again. I mean, it is within a week or\n[30:35] two that I mean, I like to think of when\n[30:39] you're in a ketogenic state, you ring\n[30:41] out that inflammation and trash in their\n[30:43] brain and the brain is like crisp. It is\n[30:46] doing a great job. And when you put the\n[30:48] sugar back in, the swelling goes back\n[30:51] into their brain. Insulin and water\n[30:53] flood the body and it's almost like a\n[30:55] minor concussion\n[30:57] and their brain is not working right and\n[30:59] they now know it. And is there any other\n[31:03] benefits to being in a ketogenic state?\n[31:05] You mentioned strength briefly.\n[31:07] >> Yeah. So when you're looking at uh do\n[31:09] you do weightlifting?\n[31:10] >> Yeah.\n[31:11] >> Okay. So when you weightlift uh uh how\n[31:14] grade your soreness on the day after\n[31:16] your like lifting day?\n[31:19] >> Um if I've been using that muscle\n[31:21] consistently, there's no real soreness.\n[31:23] >> Good. So uh let's just take a day where\n[31:25] you're pushing it harder. You're\n[31:26] deadlifting harder and you've got a\n[31:28] strain in those muscles. One of the key\n[31:30] components for repairing that as quickly\n[31:32] as possible is to be in a ketogenic\n[31:36] state to take that inflammation way\n[31:37] down. And you probably didn't need the\n[31:40] help of repairing that muscle when you\n[31:42] were, you know, 18, 22. But as you get\n[31:45] into the 30s and especially into the\n[31:46] 40s, the amount of inflammation that\n[31:50] tries to help you repair that, it\n[31:52] overshoots. And that's where the chronic\n[31:54] pain's from. That's where the delay in\n[31:56] repair comes from. So, when I look at\n[31:59] power and muscle training, I the first\n[32:01] place I talk to my patients about it is\n[32:04] how many days does it take you to get\n[32:05] back to to feeling good after you've had\n[32:07] an injury? Uh, let's let's be on the\n[32:10] side of a ketogenic setting where your\n[32:12] inflammation is super low and when you\n[32:15] tear something, which you're going to\n[32:17] tear things when you're lifting heavy,\n[32:19] the repair part is so quick. The power\n[32:22] is a little hard to talk about. If you\n[32:23] want me to go there, I can. Uh,\n[32:25] >> yeah. So, is there is there going to be\n[32:26] an impact on my my ability to train?\n[32:29] >> Yeah.\n[32:29] >> If I'm in a ketogenic diet, am I going\n[32:31] to be impacted in terms of endurance or\n[32:34] strength or power or anything like that?\n[32:36] >> So, we looked at this in um in military\n[32:39] people. uh is one of the my favorite\n[32:41] ones where they are all insulin\n[32:42] resistant and we put them on a ketogenic\n[32:45] diet and so they're trying to meet their\n[32:47] standards and at a month of being in a\n[32:50] ketogenic state, they've lost weight,\n[32:52] but their power and time didn't do\n[32:55] anything too sexy. Then you look at\n[32:58] those same soldiers at a year or I think\n[33:00] it was six months was the next time they\n[33:01] did another big check. uh and by golly,\n[33:03] they've lost even more weight and their\n[33:05] power is about 20% more than their\n[33:10] counterparts. When they get to 18 months\n[33:12] of a ketogenic diet, their power is\n[33:15] almost 50% more than what their\n[33:18] counterparts were. So, let me explain\n[33:19] that. As you're looking at a muscle, it\n[33:22] will choose which fuel it wants to use.\n[33:25] And when you've been glucose using when\n[33:26] you're on a non- ketogenic diet, it's\n[33:28] going to use glucose first to fuel. But\n[33:30] if you can train it to to use fat in\n[33:33] that training, it's a longer, better\n[33:36] fuel with less inflammation. And um\n[33:39] especially in a a state where it will\n[33:42] use both fuels quickly. That takes time.\n[33:45] I mean, it takes and what I tell\n[33:47] patients is you'll love me in 18 months.\n[33:50] You'll think I'm pretty great at 6\n[33:51] months, but if you're trying to run a\n[33:53] marathon and we're only 3 to 4 weeks\n[33:55] out, you should not start a ketogenic\n[33:56] diet. You're going to think it's the\n[33:57] worst thing ever. It's meant to train\n[34:00] muscles to use fat and that takes time.\n[34:03] >> And is there a link between some of\n[34:05] these cognitive degeneration diseases\n[34:09] like Alzheimer's, dementia, etc., and\n[34:12] the ketogenic diet? Cuz I know that\n[34:14] there's been some research that's\n[34:16] underway and has been done to try and\n[34:18] establish causality. Is there a link\n[34:21] here?\n[34:21] >> Yeah. You know, it's one of the saddest\n[34:23] places where if you look at what\n[34:25] patients regret in life, they come into\n[34:27] the clinic and they're already starting\n[34:29] to say, \"I was driving the other day and\n[34:31] I I got lost.\" And when I hear that, we\n[34:33] are 15 years too late. It is 15 years of\n[34:36] building up trash in that brain that we\n[34:38] have to clean out that debris.\n[34:41] And I had the privilege of an amazing\n[34:43] story that taught me I don't have the\n[34:46] gift of, you know, seeing into the\n[34:48] future. Am I going to reverse these\n[34:50] Alzheimer's before they show up? We\n[34:52] don't have the research for it. Um, but\n[34:54] I have a lot of clinical experience\n[34:57] saying, \"Boy, they are so much better. I\n[34:59] don't know if their memory is going to\n[35:00] stay this good. We're only three years\n[35:02] into a ketogenic diet, but it's way\n[35:04] better than when it started.\" And then I\n[35:07] had a Down syndrome patient at 40 years\n[35:12] old uh in my practice. So her mother\n[35:16] came to see me first. She said, \"I I\n[35:18] want to try this ketogenic diet. Um,\n[35:20] I've been helping my daughter who's has\n[35:23] Down syndrome. We've lost 100 pounds uh\n[35:26] because the doctor said that she might\n[35:28] do better if um if we lost some weight\n[35:32] and it's not an uncommon thing to see.\n[35:36] They have advanced insulin resistance\n[35:38] and advanced Alzheimer's\n[35:40] earlier in life. So, it's a great uh\n[35:43] place to study Alzheimer's because they\n[35:45] have a a more rapid onset of it. So, the\n[35:47] woman comes, she's lost 100 pounds, and\n[35:50] during that time, her mental cognition\n[35:53] got worse. So, now she's got 100 pounds\n[35:55] down, but none of those brain things are\n[35:57] better. And I said, \"All right, if we're\n[36:00] going to do this with your daughter,\n[36:01] we're going to make sure we're pricking\n[36:02] your finger. It's not going to be fake.\n[36:04] We're going to do a real ketogenic\n[36:05] diet.\" So, the mom starts on a ketogenic\n[36:07] diet. And I think both her and mom are\n[36:10] genetically superpowered to make ketones\n[36:12] cuz they have ketones of like three\n[36:14] within a couple of days,\n[36:15] >> which is the average would be\n[36:17] >> like one if I if they hit one in a few\n[36:19] days. I'm thinking, good job. And the\n[36:20] mom calls me at the end of the week\n[36:22] saying, \"Do you think it could possibly\n[36:23] work this fast? She is she's, you know,\n[36:26] doing the little jobs that she used to\n[36:28] do around the house.\" And I said, \"Well,\n[36:30] call me again in a week. Let's see how\n[36:31] she's doing.\" And the mom goes, \"The\n[36:33] most profound thing just happened. I've\n[36:36] taken care of this girl for 41 years.\n[36:39] And I asked her the other day if she was\n[36:40] doing something. She wanted to go to the\n[36:42] church with me, which means she left the\n[36:44] house and she was at the church and she\n[36:46] was giving her instructions to do this,\n[36:48] go around here and put it over there in\n[36:50] the give her a little job. And she said,\n[36:52] \"Do you understand?\" And the girl\n[36:54] replied, \"I understand.\"\n[36:58] I said, \"What's the big deal?\"\n[37:00] And the mother said she had never said a\n[37:03] three syllable word in her whole life.\n[37:06] Two syllables is all her brain could\n[37:08] ever put together. For the first time in\n[37:10] her whole life, three weeks onto a\n[37:12] ketogenic diet. And this Alzheimer's\n[37:16] diagnosed patient who had Down syndrome\n[37:19] now had a brain that was not only\n[37:20] working great, it was doing the best mom\n[37:23] had ever seen it. And on a ketogenic\n[37:25] diet, not only did she lose about 15 to\n[37:27] 20 more pounds, but her world opened up\n[37:30] again because her brain, which had\n[37:31] Alzheimer's, no longer had that\n[37:33] diagnosis.\n[37:34] >> I was looking at some of the supporting\n[37:36] studies around this around the impact\n[37:38] can have on the brain and studies show\n[37:41] that in dementia, especially in\n[37:42] Alzheimer's, the brain struggles to use\n[37:43] glucose efficiently. Ketones provide an\n[37:45] alternative, cleaner fuel source. Um,\n[37:47] ketogenic diets can boost mitochondrial\n[37:50] function and energy availability in\n[37:51] brain cells. Keto lowers systemic\n[37:53] inflammation which is linked to slower\n[37:55] cognitive decline. Um, ketones may\n[37:58] protect neurons from damage and promote\n[38:00] the growth of new neural connections.\n[38:01] And Alzheimer's is something called type\n[38:03] 3 diabetes which I've heard a lot. Um,\n[38:04] and keto improves insulin in sensitivity\n[38:07] potentially reducing this risk. And\n[38:09] lastly, small studies show temporary\n[38:10] improvements in memory and cognition in\n[38:12] people with mild cognitive impairment or\n[38:14] early Alzheimer's. But the evidence is\n[38:17] early stage long-term adurance can be\n[38:19] hard and the diet isn't suitable for\n[38:21] everyone. Uh for example, underweight\n[38:23] people um and people with certain\n[38:25] medical conditions,\n[38:26] >> right?\n[38:27] >> So how do I measure my blood ketone\n[38:28] levels? Is that what these devices are\n[38:31] here on the\n[38:31] >> I mean when I look at um uh giving\n[38:34] patients the freedom to say don't don't\n[38:36] come to me for the things that I that\n[38:38] you can do at home. First thing is be\n[38:41] willing to check data. Okay.\n[38:42] >> Okay. So, blood way better than any\n[38:44] other way to measure this. We're going\n[38:46] to be able to see. Should we have a\n[38:47] contest? Which one's better?\n[38:48] >> Yeah.\n[38:49] >> Okay. So, you want to go first?\n[38:51] >> Okay. So, what I'm going to do here is I\n[38:52] have a finger prick here which is going\n[38:54] to take some blood. It's going to prick\n[38:55] my finger. Then I have this little\n[38:56] reader. And I also have this little\n[38:59] strip here which I'm going to put my\n[39:00] blood onto.\n[39:01] >> And within a couple of seconds, it's\n[39:04] going to tell me how many ketones I\n[39:06] currently have in my body right now. And\n[39:08] so we're going to look at that at the\n[39:10] same time as your blood sugar, which is\n[39:12] how you can measure insulin. It's the\n[39:14] best proxy for saying how high is his\n[39:17] insulin. So put both of them in there\n[39:18] before you go because then you don't\n[39:19] have to prick yourself twice.\n[39:21] >> Okay. So\n[39:21] >> a blue one is going to measure the\n[39:23] ketones and a brown one's going to\n[39:25] measure your glucose.\n[39:27] >> Okay. And this device, how much does it\n[39:28] cost if people want to buy it at home\n[39:29] and start pricking their own?\n[39:30] >> Yeah, I think there's a kit that comes\n[39:32] with about 50 strips so you can have\n[39:35] ketones and glucose at the same time.\n[39:36] I'm guessing it's around 70 bucks or\n[39:38] maybe it's 60 to $70. I They have quite\n[39:41] the Yeah. Put it all in. There you go.\n[39:43] And so they'll still little lights on\n[39:44] the other one too, right? Perfect. Okay.\n[39:46] So now prick your finger. Best to do it\n[39:48] on the side of your finger because\n[39:49] there's less nerves there. There you go.\n[39:51] Good job.\n[39:54] >> Okay. So I'm going to put my blood onto\n[39:55] this one which is the keto reader.\n[39:59] >> And it'll it'll count. Uh let's see. I\n[40:02] think it's um\n[40:05] my glucose is 86.\n[40:08] >> Takes more blood for the ketone.\n[40:10] >> And my ketone levels are.9.\n[40:14] Okay. So that's a Dr. B's ratio of 86\n[40:17] divided by 0.9 which is probably like 95\n[40:20] or something like 95ish,\n[40:23] right?\n[40:23] >> So my glucose levels at 86. Is that high\n[40:25] or low?\n[40:26] >> That's good. Uh so I would say that's\n[40:29] not low, it's just good.\n[40:30] >> Okay. and my ketone levels are 0.9.\n[40:32] >> Right? So when you look at them in\n[40:34] comparison, like you want to have a\n[40:35] blood sugar that's not triple digit. So\n[40:38] that's very good. And the closer the\n[40:41] higher you are above 0.5, the better the\n[40:44] result. So that's pretty good number.\n[40:45] >> So if I'm in ke ketosis,\n[40:47] >> Mhm.\n[40:48] >> what reading would I have on this ketone\n[40:50] meter?\n[40:51] >> 0.5 or greater. But it would be also\n[40:53] that you have that reading without a\n[40:55] triple digit blood sugar. So when I look\n[40:57] at the combination of them, I do a\n[40:59] little math and say your Dr. ratio is\n[41:01] like 95. So you are burning fat right\n[41:03] now.\n[41:04] >> Okay.\n[41:05] >> Okay. So that's a good sign. When I am\n[41:06] trying to help people who are trying to\n[41:08] undo cancer or autoimmune or brain\n[41:12] injuries, they have to have a better Dr.\n[41:14] Boss ratio than that.\n[41:16] >> Let's do your readings, okay, to see\n[41:17] where you're at.\n[41:20] >> All right,\n[41:21] drum roll.\n[41:23] >> 83\n[41:25] and 1.7. How are you at 1.7? What have\n[41:28] you done? So, I've learned that I would\n[41:33] love to be 33 again and be able to eat\n[41:35] that late at night. [laughter]\n[41:37] You said that I'm like, \"Oh, it's been a\n[41:38] while since I've eaten that late at\n[41:40] night.\" It's probably the hardest thing\n[41:41] to teach my patients, too, is like, you\n[41:43] don't appreciate how much insulin you\n[41:45] make that late at night. Now, you're\n[41:47] still in a season where you get to just\n[41:49] kick your heels and enjoy youth. But at\n[41:52] my age, you cannot do that. I can eat in\n[41:54] the morning. I can have good calories of\n[41:57] high fat and good protein in the morning\n[41:59] and I've learned to stop eating\n[42:01] somewhere around three o'clock in the\n[42:02] afternoon. Um, in fact, if I Yeah, I\n[42:05] know.\n[42:05] >> 3:00 in the afternoon, you stop eating.\n[42:07] >> That's usually the case. You know what\n[42:09] what's really hard though is how much of\n[42:11] your life is social. Like you said, oh,\n[42:13] there was this dinner party last night\n[42:14] and I had pasta. And you're like, yep.\n[42:17] Uh, that would be something I have to\n[42:19] teach my patients. You have to say no to\n[42:21] that. You cannot be eating at 10 o'clock\n[42:23] at night if you want your insulin to not\n[42:26] to not do that deb breathing thing. And\n[42:29] boy, when their memory isn't going well,\n[42:31] when their friends are dying of u memory\n[42:34] problems, you know, it's I don't like\n[42:36] using fear tactics. I don't think they\n[42:37] last very long. But it is such a reality\n[42:41] of poor performance that I can't do\n[42:44] that. I cannot eat at 10:30 at night.\n[42:46] What is [clears throat] it about being\n[42:47] asleep that causes the sort of\n[42:50] deregulation? Like what is it about it\n[42:52] doing it at night?\n[42:53] >> So now it's going to take that metabolic\n[42:55] curve and in order to store all of the\n[42:59] part that gets stored and then turn the\n[43:01] part into fat that needs to be tucked\n[43:03] away and get back to baseline, it's\n[43:04] going to be 8 hours. At least 8 hours,\n[43:06] >> which is fine,\n[43:07] >> right?\n[43:07] >> Because I don't eat till I'm probably\n[43:09] not going to eat till 2 p.m. today.\n[43:10] >> Right. Well, you you missed one part.\n[43:12] The sun will rise. When the sun rises,\n[43:15] even if you're in solitary confinement,\n[43:18] you cannot see the sun.\n[43:19] >> Yeah.\n[43:19] >> Your brain knows that the sun just went\n[43:21] up and cortisol rises.\n[43:22] >> Okay.\n[43:23] >> Cortisol leaves your brain, goes to the\n[43:25] liver and says, you know, that stored\n[43:26] sugar, that glycogen release. You make\n[43:30] glucose first thing in the morning. How\n[43:32] much glucose depends on how insulin\n[43:34] resistant you are. So, you're going to\n[43:36] you're going to have an uneaten meal\n[43:38] when you wake up in the morning. Glucose\n[43:41] has been stored for this purpose. It's\n[43:42] going to wake you up. That's going to\n[43:43] give you the energy when sun rises to to\n[43:46] fuel you. If you got a bunch stored,\n[43:49] you're going to have a high blood sugar.\n[43:50] >> Can we do Jack's ketone levels? I'd like\n[43:52] to know where Jack is at.\n[43:53] >> Let's do that. [laughter] What's Jack do\n[43:56] for a for his?\n[43:57] >> We're about to find out.\n[43:59] >> I don't think I'm going to be\n[44:00] >> No. Wait a minute. Is Jack the one that\n[44:01] did the V2 max with Peter Aia and you\n[44:05] >> Well, you know, peak brain performance\n[44:06] is my thing and one of the hardest\n[44:08] brains to heal are chronic runners. That\n[44:10] trauma thing is real. Like it's so hard\n[44:13] to explain to them, too. If you're a\n[44:14] vegan who runs, you're in trouble.\n[44:18] >> 95% of vegans that listen to this\n[44:20] podcast frequently don't subscribe.\n[44:22] >> Oh, yeah. Well, all right. So, his\n[44:24] glucose is 88. Not too bad.\n[44:26] >> Ketones. Boo. Absolutely. Yeah. That's\n[44:29] an example of he is making trash.\n[44:32] There's no trash going out.\n[44:33] >> So, his ketone level is what the\n[44:35] >> 0.1 and his blood sugar is 88. So, if\n[44:38] you take 88 divided by 0.1, it's like\n[44:40] what? 1,000 or something. It's really\n[44:42] high. 888 probably. Uh that is a lot of\n[44:46] trash being made when that Dr. Bos ratio\n[44:49] is high. You you can't take it out.\n[44:51] >> Do you want to say that's his face? I\n[44:52] mean I feel like [laughter]\n[44:55] >> I just think that when Peter did that\n[44:57] and said, \"Oh, I had no idea.\" I'm like,\n[44:59] \"You could have just checked this first\n[45:01] thing in the morning for 5 days.\" If you\n[45:03] have that kind of a Dr. Boss ratio,\n[45:05] you're insulin resistant. You're insulin\n[45:07] resistant. You have to be hitting that\n[45:09] in a routine regular interval in life to\n[45:12] not have those problems to have\n[45:14] osteoporosis at such a young age. Uh a\n[45:16] ketogenic state would not allow that.\n[45:18] You would be using resources much\n[45:20] better.\n[45:21] >> He actually did a test and it turns out\n[45:22] he doesn't have osteoporosis but\n[45:23] >> Oh, good. That was\n[45:24] >> that was shocking.\n[45:25] >> Yeah,\n[45:26] >> it was like\n[45:27] >> you shouldn't have osteoporosis at your\n[45:28] age.\n[45:28] >> No, I think that was a misreading\n[45:30] because of the scanner, but um\n[45:31] >> Right.\n[45:32] >> but on this on this point in particular,\n[45:34] >> his keto levels are 0.1. So he's\n[45:36] basically running off glucose,\n[45:37] >> all glucose. And and so why is that\n[45:39] happening? Okay, whatever he ate, the\n[45:41] insulin went up. So let's say he was\n[45:44] your exact same eating pattern. He ate\n[45:46] last night. He had the 6, eight hours of\n[45:49] sleep. The cortisol said, \"Oh, the sun's\n[45:52] rising.\" And it rose his blood sugar a\n[45:53] little bit.\n[45:54] >> Mhm.\n[45:54] >> Okay. When the sugar's high, you can't\n[45:56] you you can't your your insulin is going\n[45:58] to be high, too. You're not making\n[45:59] ketones.\n[45:59] >> When I did these this keto test with\n[46:02] most of the team here, they were all\n[46:04] around that region. and they were in the\n[46:05] region of 0.1 ketones in their blood to\n[46:07] 0.3.\n[46:09] >> Welcome to my clinic in 10 years. That\n[46:11] is trash being made, never being taken\n[46:13] out.\n[46:14] >> And so you'd say to them, you need to do\n[46:16] some fasting. You need to\n[46:18] >> you need to cut scarves. Yeah. I mean,\n[46:20] if you're looking for quick, okay, if\n[46:22] they're in their 20s, I mean, I have\n[46:23] three kids, right? And they have heard\n[46:25] this chirp for 10 years. Uh, I mean, how\n[46:28] I got into this was my mother was very\n[46:30] sick and she was sick because of a high\n[46:32] insulin problem that caused cancer. So,\n[46:36] we put her in a ketogenic state and\n[46:37] everybody in the family got on board.\n[46:39] So, here's three little boys who no\n[46:40] longer have candy around. Now, they're\n[46:42] in their young 20s and for the first\n[46:43] time they're actually listening to say,\n[46:45] \"Gosh, mom, one of them's at Georgetown.\n[46:47] He has to read for long periods of time\n[46:49] for Georgetown Law School.\" And he's\n[46:51] like, \"If I'm not in a ketogenic state,\n[46:53] I can't keep the focus.\" And I said, I\n[46:57] said, 'Well, how are you doing that? At\n[46:58] first, he tried some of the supplements.\n[46:59] Okay, but what really happened was he\n[47:02] cut the carbs down and said, I can say\n[47:04] no to that because of the sustained\n[47:06] brain power. I mean, it's really easy in\n[47:08] your early 20s to do this. Cut the carbs\n[47:10] even to 50, but prove to yourself that\n[47:13] you made ketones and that return on your\n[47:16] dividends is you won't be seeing me in\n[47:18] 25 years.\n[47:19] >> So, you have this idea of this keto\n[47:21] continuum. Mhm.\n[47:23] >> What is the ketone continuum? I read\n[47:26] about it. I mean, it's a it's a\n[47:27] [clears throat] book here that I have\n[47:28] which you published in 2020 called the\n[47:31] ketone continuum. Consistently keto for\n[47:33] life,\n[47:34] >> right?\n[47:34] >> So, the keto continuum is this 12step\n[47:37] process,\n[47:37] >> right,\n[47:38] >> to get into a consistent keto.\n[47:40] >> Consistently keto. Yeah. That you're\n[47:41] constantly taking out the trash. The\n[47:43] first part is the beginner.\n[47:44] >> Okay. So, the first part, the beginner\n[47:46] section has four stages to it,\n[47:47] >> right?\n[47:48] >> What are what are those four stages?\n[47:49] Well, I I like to tell patients that you\n[47:52] never fall all the way off of the\n[47:53] continuum. So, the first part the first\n[47:55] step is really not keto, but it is that\n[47:57] they're eating every two to three hours.\n[47:59] And if they fall off the wagon, that's\n[48:01] usually where they land. So, that's what\n[48:02] most people start at. They're eating\n[48:03] every two to three hours. They are not\n[48:05] keeping their carbs less than 20. Step\n[48:07] two is cut your carbs to 20. That's the\n[48:10] only thing I need you to measure. And\n[48:12] you're going to be able to use a ketone\n[48:15] strip, you know, measure ketones in your\n[48:17] urine. Uh, and that will ride you you'll\n[48:20] ride a wave. And that ketone production\n[48:22] is happening. The fat-based hormones in\n[48:25] your body are starting to resurrect.\n[48:27] They're starting to do the things that\n[48:29] they need to do. And there will be this\n[48:31] magical moment in the not too near\n[48:33] future where you skip a meal.\n[48:37] >> And this that beginning stage, how long\n[48:40] does that last? I'll put this on the\n[48:41] screen so everybody can see.\n[48:43] >> Sure.\n[48:43] >> The continuum. Um, how long does that\n[48:45] initial beginner stage last for people\n[48:47] >> if they've been severely insulin\n[48:48] resistant? This is the ones where I've\n[48:50] said they took their carbs to 20 for for\n[48:54] two weeks before they peed a ketone. So,\n[48:57] I use some other steps if that's how\n[48:59] severe that is. But let's just take the\n[49:00] average person that's like not they're\n[49:02] not 100 pounds overweight. They're\n[49:04] hitting menopause and they've put on 25\n[49:05] lbs. when they drop their carbs to 20,\n[49:08] they're peing a ketone by the end of the\n[49:10] week and they are missing their first\n[49:13] meal by day 10.\n[49:14] >> Okay. So, day 10 and then it says when\n[49:17] we get to stage five in the keto\n[49:19] continuum, it says 168 168. Is that\n[49:22] >> Yeah. So, then we start to use\n[49:24] timerestricted eating uh where I want I\n[49:27] mean we're going to your body will\n[49:28] adapt. People say you can't stay on the\n[49:30] keto diet because they go to step four\n[49:32] and then they think that that's all they\n[49:33] needed to do. There are several steps to\n[49:35] reversing this problem and you'll know\n[49:37] you have the right step if the ketones\n[49:39] are still present in your gut in your\n[49:41] blood. Your body will adapt though. So,\n[49:43] we start to say, \"All right, we're going\n[49:45] to learn some new behaviors. We're going\n[49:47] to learn what the nothing burger looks\n[49:49] like at least for 16 hours out of the\n[49:52] day.\"\n[49:52] >> What does that mean?\n[49:53] >> You do not eat a thing in those 16\n[49:56] hours. Now, I I give them a little hedge\n[49:58] because most people come in like you.\n[50:00] They don't start eating until two\n[50:01] o'clock in the afternoon and then they\n[50:03] eat until 10 o'clock. And I want them\n[50:05] fat forward. I want lots of fat going in\n[50:09] because insulin resistance uh that high\n[50:12] insulin state means they've locked or\n[50:14] they've insulated their fat on their\n[50:16] body.\n[50:16] >> And then we get to stage seven where it\n[50:18] says 231. Is that fasting for 23 hours a\n[50:21] day and eating for 1 hour a day?\n[50:23] And the there's a little bitty line\n[50:25] between 168 and 23 in1, but there's a\n[50:29] whole bunch of life there. Meaning, we\n[50:30] don't actually have patients go from 16\n[50:33] hours of fasting uh to 23. We have them\n[50:36] slide it down by an hour, slide it down\n[50:38] by an hour, and then we do that harder\n[50:39] thing, which is move it towards sunrise.\n[50:42] Quit eating so late at night. And then\n[50:44] the last stage here, so so step 9, 10,\n[50:48] 11, and 12 is prolonged fasting between\n[50:52] 36 and 72-hour fasting.\n[50:54] >> Right? So those folks that have high\n[50:55] insulin for 20, you know, 15, 20 years,\n[50:59] they're going to have to do a nothing\n[51:00] burger for 36 hours in most of them to\n[51:03] really give a good reset of their\n[51:04] metabolism. And although you you look at\n[51:07] other folks saying, \"Oh, you should\n[51:08] never do that if you're a woman. You\n[51:10] should never do that over the age of\n[51:11] 50.\" I'm saying you have too much\n[51:13] insulin in your body. You have to do\n[51:15] that to get the pancreas to make less\n[51:17] insulin over time.\n[51:18] >> On that point, between men and women,\n[51:20] are there metabolic differences that\n[51:22] need to be mentioned here? Because, you\n[51:23] know, when I sometimes when I do\n[51:25] ketogenic fasting, my girlfriend, she\n[51:27] takes much longer than me to get into a\n[51:29] ketogenic state. And I'm wondering if\n[51:30] her body is in some way trying to defend\n[51:33] >> the switch.\n[51:34] >> Have you ever seen the the reality show\n[51:36] Alone?\n[51:37] >> Oh, no. I'm not show guy.\n[51:39] >> No, I'm not either. But they drop these\n[51:40] people off in the middle of nowhere and\n[51:42] they starve them to death. And you watch\n[51:44] the fat come off of them. And the men,\n[51:46] the fat just melts off of them. And the\n[51:49] women, they do what your girlfriend\n[51:51] does. It just holds on to them. That we\n[51:53] are designed to have that fat on them.\n[51:56] So asking them to do a ketogenic state,\n[51:58] you'll hear people say, \"Oh, it's going\n[52:00] to ruin your hormones. Oh, it's going to\n[52:02] you can't do that.\" And um I would\n[52:05] [clears throat] say you can have all\n[52:06] those conversations once their insulin\n[52:08] is normal. What I have lots of women in\n[52:10] childbearing years that are excessive\n[52:13] producers of insulin and their vitamin D\n[52:15] is low, their estrogen is low, they have\n[52:18] hair loss on the top of their head, they\n[52:20] have skin tags throughout their body, or\n[52:22] maybe the first sign was they had PCOS.\n[52:24] Okay, all of these are a sign that\n[52:26] insulin came in and it's too high in\n[52:28] their body. So lowering it has rules and\n[52:31] if you want to have a baby, carry a\n[52:33] baby, uh have uh the weight come off\n[52:36] after you've gestated a baby, um have\n[52:39] weight not be your enemy during\n[52:40] menopause. You have to be making ketones\n[52:43] at a routine and regular interval and\n[52:46] start with the food. Start with the\n[52:48] menus in the kitchen. Don't run to the\n[52:50] gym first. I've noticed uh in women in\n[52:53] my life that they've told me that their\n[52:55] menstrual cycles become more synced up\n[52:57] when they are in a lower carbohydrate\n[53:00] diet.\n[53:01] >> Right? Their hormones can hear each\n[53:02] other. I mean, when insulin is high,\n[53:04] insulin dictates what that sugar does,\n[53:07] but it also is the dictator for every\n[53:10] morsel of fat. And estrogen,\n[53:13] testosterone, vitamin D, they're all a\n[53:16] derivative of fat, of cholesterol. And\n[53:18] they are they're put into the fat cells.\n[53:21] If you biopsy an obese woman and say,\n[53:23] \"Can I see is there any vitamin D hidden\n[53:25] in there? Is there any estrogen? Is\n[53:27] there any?\" Yes, they're all in those\n[53:28] fat cells, you start to lower their\n[53:31] insulin and the fat mobilizes. So, the\n[53:34] hormones that are naturally communicated\n[53:36] between women, they can actually hear\n[53:38] them again. I mean, that that tribal\n[53:39] thing.\n[53:40] >> If a woman were to stay in a ketogenic\n[53:42] state permanently,\n[53:44] would there be any disruption to her\n[53:46] metabolic health?\n[53:48] >> You mean like me?\n[53:49] >> Yeah. like her, you know, her menstrual\n[53:51] cycles, her uh yeah, anything.\n[53:54] >> No, I think it's you're going to find\n[53:56] people that it shouldn't be extreme.\n[53:59] Meaning, I've been on this for 15 years.\n[54:01] The ketogenic phase is at least 20 out\n[54:05] of 30 days uh in a month. The first few\n[54:09] years I was on it. Now, at 55, menopause\n[54:12] in the last year, um I'm like without a\n[54:15] ketone, my brain doesn't work right now\n[54:17] without a ketone. uh [clears throat] my\n[54:18] energy goes to pot and I have been\n[54:21] walking women through menopause for 25\n[54:23] years. It is not a fun story when\n[54:25] they're insulin resistant. So prepare uh\n[54:28] have the flexibility of that\n[54:31] mitochondria to use both ketones and\n[54:33] glucose and that's what a ketogenic\n[54:35] state is.\n[54:36] >> Well, we have 12 cans of sardines here\n[54:38] and uh I I I wondered why you you\n[54:41] brought sardines with\n[54:44] >> Well, yes. That's a hell of a tool.\n[54:47] Why?\n[54:48] >> So, um, when you're trying to help\n[54:50] patients change behavior, [laughter]\n[54:55] >> sorry, the sardine juice has gone on my\n[54:56] iPad.\n[54:58] >> Oh, good luck getting that off. Yeah,\n[55:00] sardines rank for uh the worst smelling,\n[55:04] but they're not the worst tasting. When\n[55:06] it comes to bitter in fish, they don't\n[55:08] have the bitterness that tuna does. So,\n[55:10] >> tell me about sardines. Why Why should I\n[55:12] be eating sardines? When you're trying\n[55:13] to teach patients, those stats that you\n[55:15] read off a minute ago, they don't care.\n[55:17] They need a very clear step on how do I\n[55:20] begin. And when you're working with\n[55:22] somebody who cannot seem to get their\n[55:23] ketones to rise, and I give them a whole\n[55:26] list of menus that's too noisy, let's\n[55:28] take it down to one food that is high in\n[55:31] fat, high in some of the best fats, high\n[55:33] in protein, it's whole foods, and it's\n[55:35] affordable for everybody under the sun.\n[55:38] >> Okay. So, you do you do like a sardine\n[55:41] fast?\n[55:41] >> Yeah. So in fact that that 21 day I mean\n[55:45] 21 day is that three-week course where I\n[55:47] say I will teach you how to do an\n[55:48] advanced ketogenic diet where everybody\n[55:50] will be peeing ke or making abundant\n[55:52] ketones. On day six uh I say all right\n[55:55] the only thing on the menu for the next\n[55:57] three days is sardines. There's no\n[56:00] eating window. You can eat as much as\n[56:02] you want. There's no limit to the\n[56:03] amount. And what I'm pushing them to do\n[56:06] is not only eat a nutrient-dense food\n[56:08] but I want them to feel satiety. I want\n[56:11] them to feel full.\n[56:13] >> Do I need to be consuming a lot of fat\n[56:14] as well?\n[56:15] >> There's plenty of fat in there.\n[56:16] >> But I mean, generally, because this is\n[56:17] one of the the\n[56:18] >> things always puzzles me is I I'll go\n[56:21] let's say I went a week without eating\n[56:23] carbohydrates.\n[56:26] >> Sometimes I'm still not in ketosis. And\n[56:28] I think I heard somewhere that it's\n[56:29] because my fat\n[56:30] >> isn't high enough. So\n[56:32] >> yeah. So again, you at the time you went\n[56:34] you went seven days without eating\n[56:36] hardly any carbs, right?\n[56:37] >> And you still didn't make a lot of\n[56:38] ketones.\n[56:39] >> Okay. So you had fat on your body.\n[56:41] >> Yeah.\n[56:41] >> Okay. So why didn't the fat get to your\n[56:43] mitochondria?\n[56:45] Excess insulin. Okay. You had been in a\n[56:47] high insulin state. So if you swallow\n[56:50] the fat, then you can turn it into\n[56:51] ketones. Right now all your fats locked\n[56:54] under this insulin bed. If you kept\n[56:56] going, it would eventually hit. But\n[56:57] that's painful. I mean, I have patients\n[56:58] who do it for two weeks.\n[57:00] >> So what you saying? You're saying that I\n[57:01] need to eat fat.\n[57:03] >> Yeah. So if you put the sardines in oil,\n[57:05] uh that's a great highfat, high protein.\n[57:08] Uh, it's also a little easier to\n[57:09] masticate the the meat and you'll have\n[57:12] high fat, high protein, and you'll have\n[57:15] beautiful ketones by by 48 hours, maybe\n[57:18] 72.\n[57:18] >> And what what is the the composition of\n[57:20] my diet in terms of protein, fats, and\n[57:22] carbohydrates when I'm trying to get\n[57:24] into a ketogenic state?\n[57:25] >> Yeah. I don't let people get distracted\n[57:27] by this, right? I say look at your\n[57:29] finger. If it's got a high ketone, you\n[57:32] have got enough fat and enough protein\n[57:35] uh and low enough carbs. What most\n[57:37] people have is the story you told. I've\n[57:39] been doing this for five days. Why don't\n[57:41] I make any ketones? And the answer is\n[57:44] what is hidden behind the chemistry is\n[57:45] too much insulin. You've got to have And\n[57:49] so that's a great place to say put the\n[57:50] fat up, keep the carbs low, and the\n[57:53] ketones will come.\n[57:54] >> When you say put the fat up, you mean\n[57:55] eat more fatty foods. Give me an example\n[57:57] of the type of shopping list that if I\n[58:00] was trying to get in a ketogenic state\n[58:02] and stay there,\n[58:03] >> I would have.\n[58:04] >> Yeah. My one of my favorite things is uh\n[58:06] uh pork belly, more eggs, beef brisket,\n[58:10] uh ribs,\n[58:11] >> avocado,\n[58:12] >> avocado have a beautiful marketing team,\n[58:15] but they do have carbs in them and I've\n[58:17] had people overeat them. Like I have\n[58:19] four avocados today. I'm like that's you\n[58:21] you're on the wrong bandwagon there.\n[58:24] Avocado makes the list, don't get me\n[58:26] wrong, but it's not a diet of mostly\n[58:28] avocado with a sprinkle of chicken\n[58:29] breast. That's not going to get you into\n[58:30] ketosis. The fat has to be higher than\n[58:32] that. Most of the time when I'm really\n[58:35] struggling with a patient who just can't\n[58:37] seem to make ketones, can't seem to make\n[58:38] ketones, and they won't do the sardines,\n[58:41] I've said, \"Eat butter for a day. That's\n[58:44] 100% fat.\"\n[58:45] >> Okay. So, you can just have increase the\n[58:47] butter and\n[58:47] >> Yeah, you could have that. Okay. So,\n[58:48] that\n[58:49] >> Are there carbs in here?\n[58:50] >> No.\n[58:50] >> No.\n[58:51] >> No. It's just fat.\n[58:53] >> Mhm. And it's not awful, but it is a\n[58:57] great social experiment where they\n[58:59] haven't felt what satiety feels like in\n[59:01] a while. People talk about net carbs.\n[59:04] They say, you know, an avocado has 12\n[59:07] grams of carbs in, but it has 10 grams\n[59:09] of fiber. So, the net carbs is two.\n[59:13] >> If you've never had insulin resistant,\n[59:14] you can do it that way. My patients have\n[59:16] had high insulin, and I don't play that\n[59:18] game. It's got to be total carbs.\n[59:21] Fiber is for farting.\n[59:23] >> Do you recognize this photo of this\n[59:25] lady?\n[59:27] >> Oh, yes.\n[59:28] >> Who is she?\n[59:29] >> Why, she is just a great story. Jane had\n[59:32] uh\n[59:34] she had pathology with how she thought\n[59:36] about food. Like many patients, she\n[59:39] she had food as the way she coped with a\n[59:42] lot of things. And as long as she was\n[59:45] clearing her plate and using that food,\n[59:47] it comforted a lot of wounds. When you\n[59:50] start to address some of these things, I\n[59:52] mean, the ketogenic diet doesn't fail if\n[59:53] you just follow the chemistry. The\n[59:55] ketogenic diet fails when you have\n[59:57] humans who've had wounds, who've had a\n[01:00:00] history, who have stress, who don't\n[01:00:02] sleep. And Jane was a great story where\n[01:00:05] all the goodness in the world couldn't\n[01:00:07] undo some of that relationship she had\n[01:00:10] with food. Uh so the first time she's\n[01:00:12] one of the coaches that I used for that\n[01:00:13] 21day and she just has the best outcomes\n[01:00:16] because she was doing the a strong\n[01:00:18] ketogenic diet, you know, for those\n[01:00:19] three weeks twice a year. and she\n[01:00:22] decided that after I think the third\n[01:00:23] class she was going to do sardines only\n[01:00:26] for 30 days and she writes me at the end\n[01:00:28] of the 30 days can't believe how great\n[01:00:30] she feels and really kind of addressed\n[01:00:33] some of those demons associated with why\n[01:00:35] she would eat what she would eat and\n[01:00:38] then life hit again and she put on some\n[01:00:39] of the weight again um she'd used\n[01:00:41] sardines intermittently and she called\n[01:00:43] me and said all right I think I'm going\n[01:00:44] to do this again I'm going to just go on\n[01:00:46] sardines and really have a some come to\n[01:00:49] Jesus moments on why it why it is that I\n[01:00:51] do some of the things I do. I mean, it's\n[01:00:53] a really vulnerable moment where you can\n[01:00:56] hide those moments. You can never tell a\n[01:00:57] soul what's really going on through your\n[01:00:59] mind. And she was going to address them.\n[01:01:02] And I said, \"Well, I have a bone to pick\n[01:01:04] with Joe Rogan.\n[01:01:06] He has said some inappropriate things\n[01:01:08] about sardines, like they're arsenic\n[01:01:11] poisoning. So, I'd like to check a few\n[01:01:13] blood levels in you before you start.\"\n[01:01:15] So, we check her vitamin D, we check her\n[01:01:16] arsenic, selenium, and a few other\n[01:01:18] things. and she starts on her sardine\n[01:01:20] challenge, her sardine journey, and she\n[01:01:22] goes a 100 days, 100 days of only\n[01:01:26] sardines. And not only does she, first\n[01:01:29] of all, her vitamin D, she did not take\n[01:01:31] any vitamin D. She stopped her vitamin\n[01:01:32] D. It went from like the 30s and 40s up\n[01:01:35] to just maybe over 100, 108 or\n[01:01:38] something. Uh, her selenium didn't do\n[01:01:39] anything naughty. Her arsenic did not do\n[01:01:42] anything naughty like Joe Rogan said it\n[01:01:44] would. and she was able to um not only\n[01:01:49] shed the pounds but really\n[01:01:52] say some truths about why she was eating\n[01:01:54] so much\n[01:01:56] and she confronted the pathology about\n[01:01:59] why why is she using food for those\n[01:02:01] other things. You know, I do this thing\n[01:02:04] in the 21day where I ask them to find\n[01:02:06] their best day in their life and I'm\n[01:02:09] trying to just get them to think about\n[01:02:10] what does that feel like? What what did\n[01:02:12] that look like? and then we go to the\n[01:02:14] worst day in their life. And Jane wrote\n[01:02:15] something that really touched me. She\n[01:02:18] said, \"I don't think I've ever had the\n[01:02:20] best day of my life.\"\n[01:02:22] This was probably the third or fourth\n[01:02:23] time we'd done that exercise. So, she'\n[01:02:24] done it in a way where it didn't bring\n[01:02:27] any extra attention, but she was she\n[01:02:28] spoke a truth that just said, \"I've had\n[01:02:31] this fear for so long\n[01:02:34] that for the first time, I'm going to\n[01:02:36] say out loud that I'm looking for the\n[01:02:38] best day of my life, and I feel like I\n[01:02:40] have the freedom to do it.\n[01:02:43] That's what happened after 100 days of\n[01:02:44] sardines.\n[01:02:45] >> So if she eats a sardines for 100 days,\n[01:02:49] she's probably not going to get like the\n[01:02:51] gut microbiome.\n[01:02:53] >> She has the best gut microbiome.\n[01:02:55] >> Doesn't she need to be eating plants to\n[01:02:58] >> Oh no. Fibers for farting. So you're\n[01:03:02] looking at a gut biome, right? And so\n[01:03:04] tell me what you think that is.\n[01:03:06] >> Uh lots of bugs that have been feeding\n[01:03:09] on plants. [laughter]\n[01:03:11] >> Okay. Yes, Pututyrate has uh has part of\n[01:03:14] that equation. So, gut biome is the\n[01:03:16] slime layer inside your gut. It's where\n[01:03:18] the critters live. It's where they set\n[01:03:20] up homes and they if you have a really\n[01:03:22] good slime layer, it's squishy. It's\n[01:03:24] dense. It's not moth eaten. It's not\n[01:03:28] aquous or waterlike. It's squishy. And\n[01:03:31] when you put plants in there, when you\n[01:03:33] put fiber in there, it tears that down.\n[01:03:35] Uh, and you say, \"Well, fiber is needed\n[01:03:38] for this because some of those bugs eat\n[01:03:41] up on the fiber and they put out some\n[01:03:43] butyrate and that helps these other\n[01:03:44] bacteria to to grow.\" You're like,\n[01:03:47] \"Yeah, that's one way to get a good\n[01:03:49] microbiome.\" But we haven't been fiber\n[01:03:52] eaters forever. And when you look at\n[01:03:54] many of my carnivore patients,\n[01:03:55] especially when they've got, you know,\n[01:03:57] some of those little fish scattered into\n[01:04:00] that carnivore diet, um, their symptoms\n[01:04:03] of irritable bowel, of chronic diarrhea,\n[01:04:06] of, you know, bloody ulcers reverse.\n[01:04:10] Why? Because that gut biome got a lot\n[01:04:13] stronger and a lot healthier. So, the\n[01:04:15] things that I from doing this podcast\n[01:04:16] for a long time, the things that I' I'd\n[01:04:18] be concerned about if I just ate\n[01:04:19] sardines for a prolonged period of time\n[01:04:20] or really any diet, I guess, for a\n[01:04:22] prolonged period of time, a narrow diet\n[01:04:24] would be the fiber issue we talked\n[01:04:27] about.\n[01:04:27] >> Um, and then all the other things that\n[01:04:29] are just not in sardines, I mean,\n[01:04:30] vitamin C.\n[01:04:31] >> Yeah, you still get a good vitamin C.\n[01:04:33] So, vitamin C has different rules when\n[01:04:34] you go carnivore.\n[01:04:35] >> What about magnesium?\n[01:04:36] >> Yeah, lots of that. Magnesium, I still\n[01:04:38] think is one supplement we all need.\n[01:04:40] >> What about sodium overload? Because\n[01:04:41] these are very salty, right? your sodium\n[01:04:45] churn. How well you use sodium is\n[01:04:47] dependent on how well you've eaten in\n[01:04:48] the last week. So when you increase the\n[01:04:50] sodium, those receptors get better. When\n[01:04:52] you decrease the sodium, those receptors\n[01:04:53] showed down. That's a that is an\n[01:04:55] adjustment that everybody will make.\n[01:04:57] >> What about things like mercury and the\n[01:04:59] sort of metals toxin?\n[01:05:00] >> Little fish, little problems. You got\n[01:05:01] the right one for mercury. Again, we\n[01:05:03] tested that for her, too. 100 days, no\n[01:05:05] problem.\n[01:05:07] >> Oh, especially in the can as well.\n[01:05:09] I think I've got a bit of an issue with\n[01:05:10] canned food these days because I've\n[01:05:11] heard so many\n[01:05:12] >> microplastics,\n[01:05:13] >> microplastic toxins, etc.\n[01:05:15] >> I think you're majoring in the minor\n[01:05:16] leagues there that the the amount of\n[01:05:19] benefit that people get from sardines\n[01:05:22] versus whatever might be in those in\n[01:05:25] that can. I tell patients not to worry\n[01:05:27] about it.\n[01:05:28] >> And then the last point I said was about\n[01:05:30] digestive and mood issues because the\n[01:05:32] gut microbiome is so\n[01:05:33] >> so linked to brain. Absolutely.\n[01:05:35] >> Serotonin, isn't it? the the\n[01:05:36] >> I mean serotonin is in the gut, but it's\n[01:05:38] it's a huge part of like a GLP-1 the GIP\n[01:05:41] they're all produced hormones in the gut\n[01:05:43] that are hugely impacting your brain.\n[01:05:46] And when you want GLP-1 to be made, have\n[01:05:49] a strong thick microbiome. You do not\n[01:05:51] need fiber to do that. You need\n[01:05:52] butyrate.\n[01:05:54] Butyrate is that twocarbon\n[01:05:57] uh fat that comes from acromancia you\n[01:06:01] you know chewing up the fiber, right? or\n[01:06:05] beta hydroxybutyrate in your blood.\n[01:06:08] That's that ketone thing you're got over\n[01:06:09] there.\n[01:06:11] >> These things.\n[01:06:12] >> Yeah, all of them.\n[01:06:13] >> God. [laughter]\n[01:06:14] >> There you go. Yes. It's a beta\n[01:06:16] hydroxybutyrate is what that is going to\n[01:06:18] turn into your circulation. Butyrate is\n[01:06:21] a fat chain\n[01:06:22] >> that's two carbons long. That's what the\n[01:06:25] you're asking that microbiome to say\n[01:06:27] here this long string of fibers coming\n[01:06:29] along and that that little bug is going\n[01:06:31] to eat a piece of it and make butyrate.\n[01:06:33] Two carbons of fat. That's one of these\n[01:06:36] things that you're talking about. You\n[01:06:37] need to have butyrate. You need to have\n[01:06:38] butyrate. That's what every every Why\n[01:06:41] are you even in Viterate? You got to\n[01:06:42] have butyrate.\n[01:06:43] >> All these, you know, experts come on my\n[01:06:44] show and they talk about the importance\n[01:06:45] of having a diverse\n[01:06:46] >> I know. I I've I've watched a bunch of\n[01:06:48] them. Diverse microbiome. Yes. And what\n[01:06:51] I think\n[01:06:51] >> so it's not going to be diverse if I'm\n[01:06:52] just eating one thing.\n[01:06:53] >> Oh yes, it will.\n[01:06:55] >> Measuring.\n[01:06:56] >> So that's the whole point of a\n[01:06:57] microbiome is what what you know diverse\n[01:07:00] enough to be supportive. I mean diverse\n[01:07:03] enough to have the the two chain fat\n[01:07:06] that you want to have in there. I mean\n[01:07:08] go back uh and and look at when our\n[01:07:12] bodies were just eating um you know fish\n[01:07:15] or carnivore. Uh the the beauty of a\n[01:07:18] microbiome is how much it does adjust in\n[01:07:22] every patient.\n[01:07:23] >> What about supplementation? What are the\n[01:07:25] key supplements that you don't live\n[01:07:28] without on a daily basis?\n[01:07:30] >> Vitamin D turns out to be a really\n[01:07:32] important one. Like if I'm eating\n[01:07:33] sardines uh four or five cans a week, I\n[01:07:36] probably don't need vitamin D. But\n[01:07:38] >> why is it so important? Vitamin D.\n[01:07:40] >> Yeah. It's a hormone, right? A hormone\n[01:07:42] that goes and talks to every one of the\n[01:07:44] cells in your body. and it tells that\n[01:07:47] cell to be its best version of itself.\n[01:07:50] That hormone uh goes to the nucleus and\n[01:07:53] it makes that skin cell do something\n[01:07:55] different. It makes your brain cell do\n[01:07:57] something different. It makes your heart\n[01:07:58] cell do something different. You read\n[01:07:59] all the benefits about vitamin D and you\n[01:08:01] think it's like it's like it does\n[01:08:04] everything like how can it do all of\n[01:08:05] these things and the reason why is it is\n[01:08:08] not just a vitamin. It's a hormone that\n[01:08:10] changes how the cell functions.\n[01:08:12] Unfortunately, it's made of fat.\n[01:08:15] So, if you have high insulin, it gets\n[01:08:17] stuck parked in your fat cells and it\n[01:08:19] didn't get to the cell.\n[01:08:20] >> Is there a link between vitamin D and\n[01:08:23] ketosis and weight loss and insulin?\n[01:08:25] >> Yeah, it's actually why I pointed out\n[01:08:26] that when Jane did that 100 day, uh,\n[01:08:29] she's been struggling with her vitamin D\n[01:08:32] in the 30s or 40s, right?\n[01:08:33] >> But for the best brain, we wanted to be\n[01:08:35] of 50.\n[01:08:36] >> So, she starts on the sardine challenge.\n[01:08:37] It's in the 30s or 40s, and she's\n[01:08:39] supplementing. She's taking as much as\n[01:08:40] she can, but what's happening? her\n[01:08:43] insulin was putting it in her fat. She\n[01:08:45] goes on sardines which have vitamin D in\n[01:08:47] them. By the end, her vitamin D was 105,\n[01:08:52] 108, something like that. So, you can\n[01:08:54] see the experts say don't go above 100,\n[01:08:56] but the I don't I don't have any worry\n[01:08:59] about hers being 108. What happened was\n[01:09:02] she lowered her insulin and now fat can\n[01:09:05] move around in her body like it's\n[01:09:06] supposed to. And part of that fat isn't\n[01:09:08] just her estrogen, it was her vitamin D.\n[01:09:10] She looks like 20 years younger.\n[01:09:12] >> Isn't it amazing? You should see how\n[01:09:14] joyful she is. That's the part that\n[01:09:16] you're like what unlocked during those\n[01:09:18] 100 days of you can say food\n[01:09:20] restriction, but vitamin D went up, uh\n[01:09:22] insulin went down, and she really said,\n[01:09:26] \"How many things am I going to comfort\n[01:09:28] in my life from food?\" And let's let's\n[01:09:31] let's tackle that demon.\n[01:09:32] >> Did it stick?\n[01:09:33] >> Yeah, that's the cool part.\n[01:09:36] >> The world of business looks entirely\n[01:09:37] different today than it did 15 years\n[01:09:39] ago. Back then, building a brand meant\n[01:09:40] having huge budgets, warehouses, office\n[01:09:42] space, and lots and lots of stuff. But\n[01:09:44] now, you can start a business with your\n[01:09:46] laptop, an idea, and the right tools.\n[01:09:48] And I would know more so than anybody\n[01:09:50] else because that's exactly what I did.\n[01:09:51] Shopify is one of our long-standing\n[01:09:52] sponsors on this show, and they're a\n[01:09:54] brand I often refer people to when\n[01:09:56] they're starting their businesses\n[01:09:57] because it's a tool that contains many\n[01:09:59] more tools within itself. And when\n[01:10:00] you're starting out, everything is\n[01:10:02] everywhere. It's messy, and it's\n[01:10:04] confusing. So, having everything in the\n[01:10:05] same place is incredibly useful. Shopify\n[01:10:08] puts store design, payments, inventory,\n[01:10:10] shipping, and even AI tools all in one\n[01:10:12] place. And you can sell directly from\n[01:10:14] your website or on social media,\n[01:10:16] essentially wherever your customers\n[01:10:17] spend their time. It's truly a brilliant\n[01:10:20] business tool. So, if you want to give\n[01:10:21] it a go, head to shopify.com/bartlet\n[01:10:25] and sign up for your $1 per month trial\n[01:10:28] period. That's shopify.com/bartlet.\n[01:10:31] What What about the other supplements\n[01:10:33] that you would not live without? Well, I\n[01:10:36] think the whole world's low on\n[01:10:37] magnesium. I wish I could. Magnesium.\n[01:10:39] Yeah.\n[01:10:40] >> So, magnesium is required for every\n[01:10:42] little It's like the spark plug in our\n[01:10:44] bodies. It's a little metal and it's how\n[01:10:47] ATP gets recycled and you need it for\n[01:10:49] almost every enzyme. But our food is low\n[01:10:51] in it. Our foods, our soil is low on it.\n[01:10:53] You just got to replace it. I I use\n[01:10:56] magnesium supplements, but I also have\n[01:10:58] my patients go for a magnesium float.\n[01:11:01] >> What's that? Uh, ever seen pictures of\n[01:11:03] people in the Dead Sea?\n[01:11:05] >> No.\n[01:11:05] >> Uh, they're floating, right? This the\n[01:11:07] salinity or the salt level is so high\n[01:11:09] and it stinks, right? It's a stinky\n[01:11:11] place. It's magnesium. So, they go in\n[01:11:13] there, they soak in the magnesium and\n[01:11:15] you're like, \"Oh my gosh, I feel so much\n[01:11:16] better.\" Like, that's got to be junk\n[01:11:18] science, right? Well, it turns out it's\n[01:11:20] not. So, you can get magnesium absorbed\n[01:11:22] through your skin. And just like, I\n[01:11:25] don't know, in the 1990s you'd go rent\n[01:11:26] time in a tanning bed, you can rent time\n[01:11:29] in a magnesium float. any of this.\n[01:11:31] >> So, omega-3, if you're not doing fish,\n[01:11:34] uh you can't go wrong with omega-3. And\n[01:11:36] you know, uh I Stephen, I really push my\n[01:11:40] patients to have ketones around.\n[01:11:41] >> What? When you say ketones, you mean\n[01:11:43] external\n[01:11:44] >> exogenous ketones. Yeah.\n[01:11:45] >> So, the word exogenous means external\n[01:11:47] externally consumed. And there's some on\n[01:11:48] the table here. I'm an investor in this\n[01:11:50] company actually, so\n[01:11:51] >> that's probably worth saying. Keton IQ.\n[01:11:53] Um there you've got some other ones here\n[01:11:55] which are what's this? It's like a\n[01:11:57] >> that's ketone salts. So, this one is\n[01:11:59] just beta hydroxybuteric acid. My\n[01:12:01] husband is definitely allergic to\n[01:12:03] stevia, so I said, \"I'll make this one\n[01:12:04] for you, honey. It's just liquid\n[01:12:06] ketones,\n[01:12:07] >> okay?\n[01:12:07] >> No sweeteners, no fillers, nothing.\"\n[01:12:10] >> And is there a difference between taking\n[01:12:12] external [clears throat] ketones through\n[01:12:14] a drink or through the salts or whatever\n[01:12:16] else versus actually being in the\n[01:12:19] ketogenic state because of your diet?\n[01:12:21] >> When you make it, it is much more\n[01:12:22] abundant. But when you do what people\n[01:12:25] do, they fall off the wag again or\n[01:12:27] they're very insulin resistant, so their\n[01:12:29] body is trying to catch up to to\n[01:12:31] equilibrate, you want ketones put back\n[01:12:34] in circulation because it will spark\n[01:12:36] their liver to make ketones. So it\n[01:12:39] really is a jump start for patients with\n[01:12:41] chronic insulin resistance, chronic\n[01:12:42] problems. We got about, you know, six\n[01:12:44] years of getting them to the healthiest\n[01:12:46] version of themselves as long as they\n[01:12:47] don't fall off the wagon. So when they\n[01:12:50] are doing okay and now they need to get\n[01:12:52] back on track, give them a dose of\n[01:12:54] ketones and by putting ketones in their\n[01:12:57] circulation like that by checking their\n[01:12:59] blood, the liver will make ketones. So\n[01:13:01] it's not just a fuel. They will feel\n[01:13:04] better. It's a signal for the liver to\n[01:13:07] make more ketones.\n[01:13:08] >> But I'm not going to be burning fat than\n[01:13:09] am I?\n[01:13:09] >> You will. I mean again ketones beget\n[01:13:12] ketones. When you are making ketones,\n[01:13:13] your body makes more ketones. So if you\n[01:13:15] jump start it by swallowing some, you\n[01:13:18] get better tomorrow. they'll get better\n[01:13:19] tomorrow. And usually if somebody's\n[01:13:21] falling off the wagon, I'll have them do\n[01:13:22] ketones for like 3 days and the fourth\n[01:13:25] day they are on their own again and\n[01:13:26] they'll stay steady for a couple of\n[01:13:29] weeks and then they'll have pasta.\n[01:13:33] >> I I that's why I invested in this\n[01:13:35] company because I'm actually a owner of\n[01:13:36] the business now. Um because I saw the\n[01:13:39] benefits of having exogenous ketones on\n[01:13:42] a regular basis,\n[01:13:43] >> right?\n[01:13:43] >> So if anyone wants to try them, go to\n[01:13:44] ketone.com\n[01:13:46] >> and your [clears throat] brain will use\n[01:13:47] it like that. meaning super fast, right?\n[01:13:50] >> When I use my ketone reader, it appears\n[01:13:51] in about 15 minutes or 20 minutes for so\n[01:13:54] >> and their liver then makes more ketones\n[01:13:56] for the next 12 hours. That's the part\n[01:13:57] that I I especially for my cancer\n[01:14:00] patients or people who are really I mean\n[01:14:03] we need ketones high for their they got\n[01:14:05] chemo tomorrow. They can't afford to say\n[01:14:07] go fast for 48 hours. They don't have\n[01:14:08] the time. So let me help you. And\n[01:14:11] there's nothing better than going into\n[01:14:13] that chemotherapy, going into that\n[01:14:14] radiation to with a bunch of\n[01:14:16] antioxidants and circulation coming\n[01:14:18] right out of your liver.\n[01:14:19] >> Explain why that matters. I mean, I've\n[01:14:20] got a photo here of her.\n[01:14:23] >> Grandma Rose.\n[01:14:24] >> Grandma Rose.\n[01:14:25] >> Yeah. That's my mother. Yes. She is the\n[01:14:29] reason I'm here.\n[01:14:32] It's been five years. [snorts] Yeah.\n[01:14:35] 2015. the the most stubborn patient\n[01:14:39] walks through the door after 10 years of\n[01:14:42] the best health care I know how to give.\n[01:14:46] And she's gray and she looks like a\n[01:14:48] zombie\n[01:14:50] and she's got big lymph nodes in her\n[01:14:51] neck. You don't need to be a doctor to\n[01:14:54] know that\n[01:14:56] she's dying. Her cancer was back again.\n[01:15:01] And we go to see the oncologist uh and\n[01:15:04] he says, \"You need chemotherapy.\" And\n[01:15:06] she says, \"Why Cal, the last two times\n[01:15:08] you did that to me, I didn't know what a\n[01:15:10] sewing machine was.\"\n[01:15:12] And she made all of my clothes until I\n[01:15:14] was the age of 10.\n[01:15:18] And she's nervous because she has 6\n[01:15:20] months to live if we don't do something.\n[01:15:23] And she asks me a question that\n[01:15:28] [snorts] lots of patients have asked me\n[01:15:29] this question. I just sometimes lie.\n[01:15:34] She said, \"If it was you, what would you\n[01:15:36] do?\"\n[01:15:38] That's a really emotional question\n[01:15:39] because there's guidelines. There's the\n[01:15:41] rules. Here's what you're supposed to do\n[01:15:43] as the doctor\n[01:15:46] when it's your mom.\n[01:15:50] And I have I saw what chemotherapy did\n[01:15:52] to her. It was terrible.\n[01:15:54] She didn't know the grandkids. She It\n[01:15:57] was terrible. And we just got her back\n[01:15:59] to functional again.\n[01:16:03] And so I said I had been reading about\n[01:16:04] the ketogenic diet on brain injuries and\n[01:16:08] I'd come across a couple of studies on\n[01:16:11] what it can do to a cancer patient,\n[01:16:12] especially an insulin driven cancer\n[01:16:14] patient like she was.\n[01:16:16] I said, \"Mom, do you trust me?\"\n[01:16:20] I'm like a fool.\n[01:16:23] She said with my whole life.\n[01:16:28] We were standing there in the in the\n[01:16:29] waiting room of the hospital. Well, one\n[01:16:31] way was to schedule the chemotherapy and\n[01:16:32] the other way was the front door.\n[01:16:36] Said, \"Mom, let's get in the car\n[01:16:37] together.\"\n[01:16:38] I left my car there. I drove to my\n[01:16:40] family farm, which was 100 miles away,\n[01:16:43] and explained to my mother what a ketone\n[01:16:45] was. And her brain wasn't working right,\n[01:16:47] so she didn't quite remember.\n[01:16:49] And we went to the house. We threw out\n[01:16:51] every carbohydrate. And man, at 6 weeks\n[01:16:55] with chemotherapy, her numbers were\n[01:16:57] supposed to drop by 30% of her cancer.\n[01:17:00] We didn't tell the doctor. We just put\n[01:17:01] her on a ketogenic diet and said, \"We'll\n[01:17:03] come back in 6 weeks.\" So, she's walking\n[01:17:06] through the door of the hospital. It's 6\n[01:17:07] weeks from there. And it is like God has\n[01:17:14] just the Holy Spirit is rising out of\n[01:17:16] her. She looks amazing.\n[01:17:21] So, we go to get her blood drawn. We're\n[01:17:23] sitting in the waiting room for the for\n[01:17:24] the cancer doctor. And he's my friend.\n[01:17:26] He knows he's known me for 10 years. So,\n[01:17:29] I'm scared to tell them what we're about\n[01:17:31] to do.\n[01:17:33] So, we're sitting in there waiting and\n[01:17:34] they come and draw our blood again,\n[01:17:35] which either means it's really good or\n[01:17:37] it's really bad.\n[01:17:40] And so, I get really nervous at the end.\n[01:17:41] We've been in that room for about an\n[01:17:43] hour and I said, \"Mom, if he asks you\n[01:17:45] what you're doing, just shut up cuz I\n[01:17:47] don't know what to tell him.\"\n[01:17:50] And he walks in and he slides the piece\n[01:17:53] of paper over to me and says, \"How did\n[01:17:55] you get her numbers to drop by 70%.\n[01:17:58] There's no drug on the market that would\n[01:18:00] do that.\n[01:18:01] >> When you say numbers,\n[01:18:02] >> her cancer numbers, so the chemo would\n[01:18:05] have dropped it by 30% and the ketogenic\n[01:18:07] diet dropped it by 70%. In 6 weeks\n[01:18:12] and she went from a 70-year-old that\n[01:18:14] looked 100\n[01:18:17] to a 75year-old who looked 40.\n[01:18:22] >> How did your your mother get on from\n[01:18:23] that point onwards?\n[01:18:24] >> Yeah, she she lived her best life. I\n[01:18:26] mean, I talk about her being from this\n[01:18:28] little town of 800 people. She was Mary\n[01:18:31] Poppins. I mean, like, you don't have a\n[01:18:34] lady's aid unless you're part of the\n[01:18:36] lady's aid in in the little small town.\n[01:18:38] You don't have a Sunday school teacher\n[01:18:41] unless you're doing the Sunday school.\n[01:18:42] She was in every aspect of this little\n[01:18:45] town. [snorts] And she went back to\n[01:18:47] doing all of it. and the pandemic hit\n[01:18:51] and there's a thrift store that she\n[01:18:55] would volunteer at because well it's\n[01:18:57] just a good place to put your time and\n[01:18:59] [snorts] the community needs it. And\n[01:19:02] while she was at the thrift store\n[01:19:04] she got CO\n[01:19:07] and her cancer was of the tea cells\n[01:19:09] which means it's going to be the first\n[01:19:11] line of defense against CO\n[01:19:14] and her her tea cells failed. Some of\n[01:19:18] some of the science behind this talks\n[01:19:20] about how cancer cells often rely\n[01:19:21] heavily on glucose for energy, a\n[01:19:23] phenomenon known as the Wahberg effect.\n[01:19:25] The keto diet drastically reduces\n[01:19:27] carbohydrate intake, forcing the body to\n[01:19:29] produce ketones for fuel instead of\n[01:19:30] glucose. Healthy cells can use ketones\n[01:19:32] efficiently. Many cancer cells cannot.\n[01:19:34] So in theory, keto could starve tumors\n[01:19:36] while supporting normal tissue. And\n[01:19:39] they've done some animal studies that\n[01:19:40] show it can slow tumor growth in some\n[01:19:43] cancers especially brain cancers like\n[01:19:45] glimoblastto\n[01:19:46] >> glyobblastoma. Yep.\n[01:19:48] >> Enhance response to radiation or\n[01:19:49] chemotherapy in certain models and\n[01:19:51] reduce inflammation and oxidative stress\n[01:19:52] creating less a less cancer friendly\n[01:19:55] environment. However, results are mixed.\n[01:19:58] Uh it may also benefit muscle mass and\n[01:20:00] weight stability in patients losing\n[01:20:02] muscle from treatment. may improve\n[01:20:03] energy levels and mental clarity for\n[01:20:05] some people and could reduce insulin and\n[01:20:06] IGF-1 levels, hormones linked to cancer\n[01:20:09] growth, may improve quality of life when\n[01:20:11] used alongside standard treatments like\n[01:20:13] chemotherapy. Um, there's al also a list\n[01:20:15] of potential risks which I'll throw up\n[01:20:17] on the screen. And I guess the summary\n[01:20:18] here is keto may help by lowering\n[01:20:20] glucose and insulin, reducing\n[01:20:21] inflammation, and supporting metabolism,\n[01:20:23] but it can be risky if it leads to\n[01:20:24] malnutrition fatigue or worsen treatment\n[01:20:26] tolerance.\n[01:20:27] >> When patients I get a lot of people\n[01:20:29] calling and saying, \"Is it going to help\n[01:20:30] my cancer? Is it going to help my\n[01:20:31] cancer? Stephen, I go back to the same\n[01:20:33] thing. The amount of trash that you've\n[01:20:35] not been taking out, we have to start.\n[01:20:37] And when you put them in a ketogenic\n[01:20:39] state, I mean, it really helped her\n[01:20:41] cancer. It really did that war effect.\n[01:20:43] She was a a new human within 3 weeks.\n[01:20:47] But she had a lot of trash to take out.\n[01:20:49] This was a year and a half before she\n[01:20:50] got to be the best version of herself.\n[01:20:52] And it really did return and restore her\n[01:20:55] to to health. When I look at patients\n[01:20:57] now who say, you know, can is I am I\n[01:20:59] going to reverse my cancer with a\n[01:21:00] ketogenic diet? I'm like, no, but you\n[01:21:02] are going to deal with it a lot better.\n[01:21:04] >> I guess that's really what it comes down\n[01:21:05] to. It's like creating a better\n[01:21:06] environment so that if disease does\n[01:21:08] arrive, obviously there is a, you know,\n[01:21:10] with a lot of diseases, there is a\n[01:21:12] causal element where the way we eat and\n[01:21:14] our lifestyle does create the disease,\n[01:21:16] >> right?\n[01:21:17] >> Um, but also when that disease arrives,\n[01:21:19] what like environment is your body in to\n[01:21:22] deal with it, to manage it? And I think\n[01:21:24] a lot about this I think in part because\n[01:21:25] of the pandemic where for the first time\n[01:21:27] in my fairly young life I saw that your\n[01:21:29] current physiological environment so\n[01:21:32] your current the current state of your\n[01:21:33] body was the single biggest predictor of\n[01:21:35] your outcomes.\n[01:21:36] >> Amen. Oh it was terrible.\n[01:21:37] >> So I think 30 years old and it was like\n[01:21:39] well if you're currently overweight your\n[01:21:40] ch chance of dying from COVID is really\n[01:21:44] really high. And so I think that was one\n[01:21:46] of the big sort of protagonists in me\n[01:21:48] getting into shape was realizing that,\n[01:21:50] you know, diseases are probably going to\n[01:21:51] happen to me, but how my body responds\n[01:21:53] to it is to be determined. And I look at\n[01:21:57] how much when you're asking an elder\n[01:21:58] person to lose weight. And you just read\n[01:22:01] something really important there, which\n[01:22:02] is when those ketones are in\n[01:22:03] circulation, it is a signaling agent to\n[01:22:06] make more ketones, but it also signals\n[01:22:08] the body to say don't use muscle mass as\n[01:22:10] a resource. Go for the fat. So you can\n[01:22:12] see this protective m I mean you take\n[01:22:14] people through chemotherapy and they\n[01:22:16] have you know they shed way too many\n[01:22:19] pounds right you put them in a ketogenic\n[01:22:21] state and their muscle mass gets higher\n[01:22:23] preserved their brain function their\n[01:22:25] ability to handle this you know one of\n[01:22:27] life's most enormous fears is death and\n[01:22:31] that mood stability and muscle mass\n[01:22:34] protection because they've got ketones\n[01:22:36] in circulation boy that's the gift that\n[01:22:39] they need right now in in high numbers.\n[01:22:43] >> What is um I've heard you talk about\n[01:22:44] methylene blue.\n[01:22:46] >> Oh.\n[01:22:46] >> For brain health.\n[01:22:47] >> Ever done that?\n[01:22:48] >> No.\n[01:22:48] >> Oh my goodness.\n[01:22:49] >> What is it?\n[01:22:49] >> Well, it's old as dirt, so nobody's\n[01:22:53] making money on it. But it is a dye. And\n[01:22:56] so if you swallow it, you'll pee blue.\n[01:22:59] But it's also a bridge for how to help\n[01:23:03] mitochondria move fuel along. So, one of\n[01:23:07] the worst parts, you asked me this\n[01:23:08] question about supplements and I really\n[01:23:10] have a tough time saying which\n[01:23:12] supplements actually get to the cells\n[01:23:14] that the patients are looking for.\n[01:23:16] [snorts] There is a really great fact\n[01:23:17] about methylene blue that when you\n[01:23:19] swallow it, it actually was used for\n[01:23:22] malaria treatment or antimmalaria for\n[01:23:24] soldiers and they would check compliance\n[01:23:28] by making sure that their pee was blue.\n[01:23:31] But when they died at autopsy, they had\n[01:23:33] blue brains and blue hearts. it would\n[01:23:36] dye these organs blue. You say, \"My\n[01:23:39] gosh, that's so strange.\" But you know\n[01:23:41] what that tells me? It got to the cells\n[01:23:43] that it was advertising it was going to\n[01:23:45] get to. So you look at methylene blue,\n[01:23:47] it's supposed to supercharge your brain.\n[01:23:49] And I'm like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've\n[01:23:50] heard this before.\" So I I read about it\n[01:23:53] and I'm like, \"Wow, there's a lot of\n[01:23:55] literature on this.\" And then I did what\n[01:23:57] I normally do, which is, \"Well, let me\n[01:23:58] take it for a couple weeks.\" It was\n[01:24:00] amazing. It was amazing. Like\n[01:24:04] I I was floored at how well that little\n[01:24:06] turkey worked. So there's no money to be\n[01:24:08] made on it. It's a It's been around as\n[01:24:10] long as dirt, but it's a powerful brain\n[01:24:14] energizer. Like it helps the mito the\n[01:24:16] electrical stimulus of the mitochondria\n[01:24:19] in your brain keep energy high. And\n[01:24:22] especially for like high energy brains,\n[01:24:24] I I love it. I I'm like I put that in my\n[01:24:27] morning morning coffee which is where\n[01:24:30] the April Fools joke because nobody can\n[01:24:32] see in their coffee but they definitely\n[01:24:33] pee blue.\n[01:24:34] >> And do you take creatine as well?\n[01:24:35] >> I do take creatine. Yeah. Yeah. It's\n[01:24:37] great. That brain supplement is awesome.\n[01:24:39] Do you do\n[01:24:39] >> I do but my doctor the other day I think\n[01:24:41] he was suggesting that I might have\n[01:24:42] taken too much.\n[01:24:43] >> Why?\n[01:24:44] >> Some liver scan I had and he was saying\n[01:24:46] that\n[01:24:47] >> liver scan or kidney scan?\n[01:24:48] >> Kidney scan. That was\n[01:24:49] >> kidney scan. So that's a trick. Don't\n[01:24:50] don't fall for that. I mean, I've done a\n[01:24:52] couple of big shows on this where\n[01:24:54] creatine is what you're going to measure\n[01:24:55] kidney function with. When your doctor\n[01:24:57] checked your kidneys, he probably had\n[01:24:59] you pee in a cup and check your blood.\n[01:25:01] >> Yeah.\n[01:25:01] >> Yeah. So, he's looking at what did you\n[01:25:02] pee out and what how clean is your\n[01:25:04] blood? That's what kidneys do.\n[01:25:05] >> He just did a blood test.\n[01:25:06] >> Okay. Well, even the blood test, it the\n[01:25:08] trash was looking like it was a little\n[01:25:10] higher because the trash we're measuring\n[01:25:12] is creatine, creatinin, uh, and which is\n[01:25:16] made from your supplement. So, you put\n[01:25:18] the supplement in and it looks like\n[01:25:19] there's more trash around, but That's\n[01:25:22] just the supplement. It's falsely\n[01:25:23] elevated. It's not true. You your\n[01:25:25] kidneys did not get hurt by that. This I\n[01:25:27] answer this question probably 30 times a\n[01:25:29] week. I have a standard email saying,\n[01:25:30] \"Here's what happened. Don't measure\n[01:25:32] that.\" There's other ways he could have\n[01:25:33] measured your kidney that would not have\n[01:25:35] been manipulated by that supplement. Uh\n[01:25:38] what it does for brain function,\n[01:25:39] especially if there's any ADHD, man,\n[01:25:42] they love it. They they just focus for a\n[01:25:44] long period of time. I mean, it's got\n[01:25:46] other great findings like if you how how\n[01:25:49] often do you fly over to London?\n[01:25:51] >> I fly alone.\n[01:25:52] >> Yeah, that's the best part about it is\n[01:25:54] that the the the jet leg part of it.\n[01:25:56] There's really good studies on this.\n[01:25:57] Like your reset of sleep is going to be\n[01:26:01] augmented if you take like 20 grams of\n[01:26:04] it after the flight, 10 in the morning,\n[01:26:07] 10 at night. Uh and those are great\n[01:26:08] studies like you [clears throat] know,\n[01:26:10] Navy Seals sleepdeprived.\n[01:26:13] Watch what happens when you add\n[01:26:14] creatine.\n[01:26:15] >> A lot of women don't take creatine\n[01:26:16] because they've historically thought of\n[01:26:17] it as like a bodybuilder thing,\n[01:26:19] >> right? It's a brain thing.\n[01:26:20] >> And you take creatine every day.\n[01:26:22] >> How much do you take?\n[01:26:23] >> So, two scoops.\n[01:26:24] >> Yeah.\n[01:26:25] >> Every single day.\n[01:26:25] >> Every single day. Seven days a week.\n[01:26:26] >> I put my methylene blue in it, too. Down\n[01:26:29] at first thing in the morning. I got\n[01:26:30] blue dyed creatine.\n[01:26:33] I mean, those two supplements are just\n[01:26:34] they they blew my mind with the amount\n[01:26:35] of research out there. And then I did\n[01:26:37] them. Uh I mean, I'm not a big\n[01:26:39] bodybuilder. I do some CrossFitty kind\n[01:26:41] of stuff three times a week. Um, so\n[01:26:44] there's that, but I do it for the brain\n[01:26:46] stuff. The brain stuff is really\n[01:26:47] impressive.\n[01:26:48] >> At the moment in society, people are\n[01:26:50] talking a lot about JLP1s and a Zmpeek\n[01:26:53] and all this kind of stuff. And um, I\n[01:26:55] was wondering if there's any harms or\n[01:26:58] downsides in your view of using these\n[01:27:00] amp WGO JLP1 protagonists\n[01:27:05] >> antagonist agonist.\n[01:27:06] >> Agonist agonist. And if there's a\n[01:27:08] natural version for those of us that are\n[01:27:10] looking to have less cravings,\n[01:27:14] um, but we don't want to take GLP1s. We\n[01:27:16] don't want to be injecting ourselves.\n[01:27:18] >> Yeah. So, those hormones are powerful. I\n[01:27:19] mean, you if you think that weight loss\n[01:27:21] isn't a hormonal problem, uh, show up at\n[01:27:24] a medical clinic that that they are\n[01:27:27] powerful hormones that hijack people\n[01:27:30] into a healthier uh, or at least a\n[01:27:33] weight loss stage. But when you're\n[01:27:34] looking at using this powerful hormone,\n[01:27:37] okay, and use it for a short time, use\n[01:27:39] it for a long time. What are the rules?\n[01:27:40] These are brand new. One of the\n[01:27:42] analogies I use for patients is, uh,\n[01:27:44] Stephen, if you wanted to have legs with\n[01:27:46] no hair on them, how would you\n[01:27:48] accomplish that?\n[01:27:49] >> Shaving them,\n[01:27:50] >> right? Because that would be short-term,\n[01:27:51] easy, and reversible. You would not take\n[01:27:54] chemotherapy, the most powerful,\n[01:27:57] amazing, they'll be every hair on your\n[01:27:59] body will be off in the next two weeks.\n[01:28:02] and it's short term they'll come back\n[01:28:04] but there's a price to pay when you're\n[01:28:05] using a really powerful unit to do\n[01:28:08] something for a vanity reason. So it's\n[01:28:11] where I like to begin when I talk about\n[01:28:12] GLP1s.\n[01:28:14] It's it's amazing. You will lose fat and\n[01:28:17] >> what do I do instead then?\n[01:28:19] >> So there's great ways to lower GLP1s or\n[01:28:23] great ways to raise GLP1s, right? Uh for\n[01:28:26] starters um when you're overweight it\n[01:28:29] suppresses it a lot. So getting the\n[01:28:31] weight off is a huge part of it. That's\n[01:28:32] why this ketogenic diet is so powerful.\n[01:28:34] Will get the weight off and that will\n[01:28:36] lift naturally the GLP1s.\n[01:28:38] >> Is there other ways to suppress um well\n[01:28:41] suppress I was going to say suppress my\n[01:28:42] appetite but more to just get rid of the\n[01:28:44] cravings?\n[01:28:45] >> Well, you'll suppress the appetite by\n[01:28:47] raising those hormones. So you put in\n[01:28:49] alulose. That's a great little boost to\n[01:28:50] that. You put in butyrate. Whether or\n[01:28:53] not that's the bug that you were talking\n[01:28:55] about or the supplements, butyrate\n[01:28:58] increases and stimulates GLP1\n[01:29:01] >> and butyrate just for for those that\n[01:29:04] might not know that word again,\n[01:29:05] >> right? That's a that is what a ketone\n[01:29:07] looks like floating around your blood.\n[01:29:08] >> Okay.\n[01:29:09] >> Yeah. Uh so a ketogenic state will raise\n[01:29:11] those hormones and suppress appetite.\n[01:29:13] >> I've seen a bunch of studies on that\n[01:29:14] that show that when people are high in\n[01:29:16] >> ketones,\n[01:29:17] >> ketones, they have a a suppressed\n[01:29:18] appetite,\n[01:29:19] >> right? And that is linked to the\n[01:29:20] production of some of these hormones,\n[01:29:22] these really great hormones. But you\n[01:29:23] make them naturally. And so it's not the\n[01:29:25] addiction part, it's the natural way to\n[01:29:27] make it. I\n[01:29:27] >> I do find that anyway. I find that when\n[01:29:29] um I guess it could be something to do\n[01:29:31] with my dopamine receptors as well in my\n[01:29:32] brain, but I find that when I'm in a\n[01:29:33] ketogenic diet, my cravings for the\n[01:29:35] things that I once craved, like I don't\n[01:29:37] know, like carrot cake or cinnamon\n[01:29:39] rolls, they just completely seem to\n[01:29:41] vanish.\n[01:29:42] >> That's the same thing that happens when\n[01:29:43] you give them that shot too.\n[01:29:44] >> Oh, really? When you give them JLP1?\n[01:29:46] >> Yes.\n[01:29:46] >> Okay. And I mean the beautiful part is\n[01:29:50] you're young. You'll make a lot of GLP.\n[01:29:51] You've already made healthy GLP-1.\n[01:29:53] You'll hijack and suppress it by being\n[01:29:55] overweight and high insulin. So\n[01:29:58] constantly delivering ketones to your\n[01:30:00] blood, that's how you keep it high and\n[01:30:02] you don't end up on the shot, which is\n[01:30:03] expensive and very powerful. I always\n[01:30:06] think, you know, when we give people\n[01:30:07] advice on things like weight loss,\n[01:30:10] >> there's always a part missing, which is\n[01:30:11] this part about like discipline and\n[01:30:13] motivation or whatever one might call\n[01:30:14] it,\n[01:30:15] >> which is the is gives somebody the sort\n[01:30:18] of activation energy to even stick to\n[01:30:21] it. Do you think about this much in your\n[01:30:22] patients? You talk about motivation.\n[01:30:24] >> It's huge. I mean, again, most people\n[01:30:26] show up because there's been a recent\n[01:30:27] crisis. Somebody died, they had a\n[01:30:29] diagnosis, something broke, they didn't\n[01:30:30] repair well. All of that is true and I\n[01:30:33] can get them motivated for a little\n[01:30:35] while. And then we have the long game\n[01:30:37] and you look at that story with a\n[01:30:38] hundred days of sardines. Okay, that's\n[01:30:40] two years into her journey where she\n[01:30:42] finally says, \"Okay, there's this demon\n[01:30:44] that keeps coming about and I keep\n[01:30:46] falling off for all the wrong, you know,\n[01:30:47] all the reasons everybody else does.\"\n[01:30:49] And so she commits to this 100 days and\n[01:30:51] what happens is a whole bunch of things\n[01:30:53] go right. Her hormones go up and she was\n[01:30:56] has an amazing story. But most people\n[01:30:58] are not going to do that. So, in my\n[01:31:01] practice, I do say these the smallest\n[01:31:04] dose of these hormones, I'll help you\n[01:31:06] when you're struggling. I want you in a\n[01:31:08] ketogenic state before we we begin. I\n[01:31:10] can use much less that hormone. And then\n[01:31:12] you have ownership of this because if I\n[01:31:15] come in and do all of the work again,\n[01:31:17] that's like every other thing I've been\n[01:31:19] doing for the last 20 years. Here's your\n[01:31:21] symptom. Here's my diagnosis. Here's the\n[01:31:22] prescription. And I need it to be you\n[01:31:25] that succeeds here. I'll lift you a\n[01:31:27] little bit. So what do you is there any\n[01:31:29] tricks to get someone to be motivated?\n[01:31:31] Is there any do you have to focus them\n[01:31:32] on their why?\n[01:31:33] >> Yeah.\n[01:31:34] >> Yeah. Exactly right. You're right. Uh\n[01:31:35] that that first trick is get out of\n[01:31:38] crisis mode. Okay. Crisis is what brings\n[01:31:40] them in. But to stay the course, you\n[01:31:43] have to get to a very serious moment\n[01:31:44] where you say, \"What? What motivates me?\n[01:31:48] What at the deepest heart am I most\n[01:31:50] insecure about that I'm going to do when\n[01:31:52] all else fails? When everybody else\n[01:31:54] gives up? I'm gonna find something that\n[01:31:57] I'm this little farm kid from the middle\n[01:31:59] of nowhere who was, you know, third\n[01:32:01] grade stinky girl. You like I was a farm\n[01:32:03] kid. I was a hog farmer's daughter. I\n[01:32:05] wasn't the smart one. I wasn't the, you\n[01:32:07] know, the best one. I'm going to carry\n[01:32:09] that insecurity with me until the day I\n[01:32:11] die. What has that done? It makes me\n[01:32:13] work really hard when everybody else\n[01:32:15] gives up.\n[01:32:17] Now finding that for them and and using\n[01:32:21] that using that harness to say your\n[01:32:23] biggest failure your biggest insecurity\n[01:32:26] can be your power by reframing it\n[01:32:30] and that why we work on that every time\n[01:32:32] we do that 21day\n[01:32:34] Jane she did that four times before she\n[01:32:36] really got to the core center why do you\n[01:32:39] keep doing this that's how people stay\n[01:32:42] motivated it's a truth it's a truth\n[01:32:44] serum\n[01:32:46] All I had to do was brain dump. Imagine\n[01:32:48] if you had someone with you at all times\n[01:32:51] that could take the ideas you have in\n[01:32:53] your head, synthesize them with AI to\n[01:32:55] make them sound better and more\n[01:32:57] grammatically correct and write them\n[01:32:58] down for you. This is exactly what\n[01:33:00] Whisper Flow is in my life. It is this\n[01:33:02] thought partner that helps me explain\n[01:33:04] what I want to say. And it now means\n[01:33:06] that on the go, when I'm alone in my\n[01:33:08] office, when I'm out and about, I can\n[01:33:10] respond to emails and Slack messages and\n[01:33:12] WhatsApps and everything across all of\n[01:33:14] my devices just by speaking. I love this\n[01:33:16] tool. And I started talking about this\n[01:33:17] on my behindthescenes channel a couple\n[01:33:19] of months back. And then the founder\n[01:33:20] reached out to me and said, \"We're\n[01:33:21] seeing a lot of people come to our tour\n[01:33:23] because of you.\" So, we'd love to be a\n[01:33:24] sponsor. We'd love you to be an investor\n[01:33:26] in the company. And so, I signed up for\n[01:33:27] both of those offers and I'm now an\n[01:33:29] investor and a huge partner in a company\n[01:33:31] called Whisper Flow. You have to check\n[01:33:33] it out. Whisper Flow is four times\n[01:33:35] faster than typing. So, if you want to\n[01:33:36] give it a try, head over to\n[01:33:38] whisperflow.ai/doac\n[01:33:41] to get started for free. And you can\n[01:33:42] find that link to whisperflow in the\n[01:33:45] description below. Have you ever heard\n[01:33:47] about this before? This thing I'm\n[01:33:48] holding in my hands now. This is called\n[01:33:50] ketone IQ. Their website is ketone.com.\n[01:33:53] You've heard me on this podcast talking\n[01:33:55] about the fact that I stay much of the\n[01:33:56] year in a ketogenic state, which is a\n[01:33:58] highly restricted diet. And the reason I\n[01:34:01] do that is plentifold. One of them is I\n[01:34:03] spend hours and hours talking to people\n[01:34:04] for a living. So I want to make sure my\n[01:34:06] brain is firing in an optimal way. And\n[01:34:08] the other reason that I do the ketogenic\n[01:34:10] diet is because I just feel better. So\n[01:34:13] when I discovered this, which is what\n[01:34:15] they call an exogenous ketone product\n[01:34:17] where you can drink it and it increases\n[01:34:19] your blood's ketone levels, I was blown\n[01:34:22] away. I contacted them, I met them, I\n[01:34:24] invested extremely heavily into their\n[01:34:27] company and I've become a co-owner of\n[01:34:28] the company accordingly and they sponsor\n[01:34:30] this show now. So, if you want to try\n[01:34:32] this out for yourself, I recommend you\n[01:34:34] try it.

You'll also get a\n[01:34:40] free gift with your second shipment.\n[01:34:42] That's ketone.com/stephven.\n[01:34:47] I was reading about what happened to you\n[01:34:48] in 2011 2010 2011 when you reached what\n[01:34:51] you you referred to as your breaking\n[01:34:53] point of corporate medicine.\n[01:34:55] >> Yeah. And you had some issues because\n[01:34:57] you were, I think, helping some people\n[01:34:59] who were homeless.\n[01:35:03] >> Yep.\n[01:35:04] >> What What do I need to know about that?\n[01:35:05] And how has that shaped you?\n[01:35:07] >> Corporate medicine has lots of flaws and\n[01:35:10] you get tired of answering the same\n[01:35:11] question over and over and over again.\n[01:35:13] So, you put some stuff up on YouTube and\n[01:35:15] you start to say, \"Here's the education\n[01:35:17] I wish I could give you.\" Uh, and this\n[01:35:19] starts to work, but that's not the\n[01:35:22] that's not the path. If you're into\n[01:35:23] corporate medicine, you're going to\n[01:35:24] ruffle feathers. You're going to tick\n[01:35:26] people off. [gasps]\n[01:35:28] I left corporate medicine, started my\n[01:35:30] own thing, and I'm living out a two-year\n[01:35:32] non-compete. Do you know what that\n[01:35:34] means?\n[01:35:35] >> But you can't do medicine for two years\n[01:35:38] >> in that same market where they recruited\n[01:35:40] me and they had advertised for me.\n[01:35:42] >> Okay.\n[01:35:43] >> Okay. So, you can't compete with what we\n[01:35:44] just put money into for two years. And\n[01:35:47] they said, \"You can see the homeless and\n[01:35:49] you can see Medicaid.\" Medicaid being\n[01:35:51] the like government funded med medicine\n[01:35:53] program,\n[01:35:53] >> low income. So I said, \"They don't know\n[01:35:55] me very well. Those are just as much my\n[01:35:56] people as anybody else. I'm taking care\n[01:35:58] of some Native Americans. They were the\n[01:36:00] ones in the shelters. They're the ones\n[01:36:02] of the low income. And those teenagers\n[01:36:06] were overweight and they were eating\n[01:36:08] kitty litter. They were eating toilet\n[01:36:10] paper. Their iron was so low the machine\n[01:36:14] couldn't measure it. So they're super\n[01:36:15] malnourished.\" I started doing what I\n[01:36:18] would do if you had all the money in the\n[01:36:19] world. I took care of these patients. I\n[01:36:21] gave them IV iron.\n[01:36:22] >> She gave them iron, which\n[01:36:24] >> was expensive. It caused a ruckus. I got\n[01:36:27] put on the radar of somebody that did\n[01:36:29] not like that. So, this is a budget. The\n[01:36:31] whole state gets a budget for how much\n[01:36:32] you're going to spend on each patient.\n[01:36:34] >> Yeah.\n[01:36:34] >> I mean, by expensive, it was like 350\n[01:36:36] bucks per person. That's not that\n[01:36:38] expensive,\n[01:36:39] >> but [clears throat] it was. And nobody\n[01:36:40] else was doing it. And I got a sticky\n[01:36:43] note inside an envelope from the state\n[01:36:45] capital. Stop doing Cadillac medicine.\n[01:36:49] Yeah.\n[01:36:50] >> So, you you were sued eventually.\n[01:36:52] >> Oh, they they call it Medicaid fraud.\n[01:36:54] >> Okay.\n[01:36:55] >> They thought I was wasting Medicare's\n[01:36:57] numbers because I was giving IV iron.\n[01:36:59] And I said, \"No, I didn't bill for it.\n[01:37:01] Bill for it. I paid for it.\" And when I\n[01:37:04] paid for the medicine for these\n[01:37:06] impoverished patients, they said, \"Well,\n[01:37:08] that's Medicaid fraud.\" So, the\n[01:37:11] government tried to sue me for that and\n[01:37:13] they lost. But now they're ticked off.\n[01:37:15] They've brought me to court and they\n[01:37:16] lost. And what happened next is a lot\n[01:37:20] worse. I don't know if you want to hear\n[01:37:22] that. You want me to go there?\n[01:37:23] >> Of course. Yeah.\n[01:37:24] >> Okay. [sighs and gasps]\n[01:37:26] So, when you are being investigated for\n[01:37:29] Medicaid fraud, all income stops.\n[01:37:31] >> Yeah.\n[01:37:32] >> Yeah. So, I have to come home to my\n[01:37:35] husband and say,\n[01:37:36] \"I just can't I can't give in. I think\n[01:37:39] we need to fight this.\" He said, \"Okay.\"\n[01:37:43] He he God bless him. He said, \"Okay,\n[01:37:45] let's fight it.\" Have you ever tried to\n[01:37:47] fight the government? That's very\n[01:37:49] expensive. So they hold off you you when\n[01:37:52] you're under a Medicaid and fra fraud\n[01:37:54] investigation, you get no paychecks. So\n[01:37:56] we have no paychecks to pay payroll, to\n[01:37:58] pay house payments, to do anything for\n[01:38:00] about 9 and a half months. Actually, it\n[01:38:02] lasted longer than that. During that\n[01:38:04] time, we started doing things like we\n[01:38:07] sold the lake cabin, we sold the boats,\n[01:38:09] we sold the extra car, we sold our own\n[01:38:12] house, we moved into a donated RV. You\n[01:38:16] moved into a car,\n[01:38:17] >> an RV. Yep. In South Dakota where\n[01:38:20] there's 50 below zero weather with three\n[01:38:23] little kids.\n[01:38:24] We actually used we took our wedding\n[01:38:28] rings in for the last paycheck.\n[01:38:31] I I just can't give in.\n[01:38:34] And then I won. Okay. So, Medicaid fraud\n[01:38:37] wasn't there. But in the midst of that,\n[01:38:39] I said I This was when Obamacare was\n[01:38:42] really happening. and I got asked\n[01:38:44] [clears throat] to run for US Senate.\n[01:38:46] There's only a hundred of those in the\n[01:38:47] country.\n[01:38:49] I ran for US Senate and I did really\n[01:38:52] good.\n[01:38:54] I raised\n[01:38:56] insane amounts of money uh saying I am a\n[01:38:59] doctor that serves the poor. I am a\n[01:39:02] physician that runs her own company. Uh,\n[01:39:05] I think I am a great voice to send to\n[01:39:07] Washington DC to make policy about\n[01:39:09] patience and care\n[01:39:12] as opposed to the other opponents.\n[01:39:15] But that same attorney general, his best\n[01:39:17] buddy was running against me. And when I\n[01:39:20] am in a mission trip\n[01:39:23] uh in the Philippines, that has nothing\n[01:39:25] to do with it, but I was on a mission\n[01:39:26] trip in the Philippines and um I left a\n[01:39:29] petition behind. I don't know how you do\n[01:39:31] it in London, but a petition means if\n[01:39:33] you're going to run for office, you got\n[01:39:35] to get some people saying they believe\n[01:39:36] in you.\n[01:39:37] >> Mhm.\n[01:39:37] >> So, we needed 2,000 signatures. And we\n[01:39:40] got 6,000 signatures. We submitted them\n[01:39:42] to the state. We think there's no\n[01:39:44] problem.\n[01:39:46] But then the quarterly earnings come\n[01:39:48] back for a campaign raising. And my\n[01:39:50] opponent had about 70 donors at about\n[01:39:53] $10,000 a pop and had something like\n[01:39:57] $740,000.\n[01:40:01] I put my earnings in and they\n[01:40:03] [clears throat] were $780,000.\n[01:40:05] So I outraised him. You have to report\n[01:40:08] to the government whenever somebody\n[01:40:10] gives you more than $200. So his donors\n[01:40:12] are right there on the list.\n[01:40:15] My list is empty\n[01:40:18] because the average size of the donation\n[01:40:19] was $45 and they know they can't win\n[01:40:23] with that. I have a grassroots behind me\n[01:40:26] and that's when the black cars started\n[01:40:29] showing up in my life. It sounds like\n[01:40:31] I've got a tinfoil hat, but it was real.\n[01:40:34] >> The black what?\n[01:40:35] >> The state card started to show up\n[01:40:37] outside my house. They started to say,\n[01:40:40] \"Find something on her.\"\n[01:40:42] And I am the first person in the history\n[01:40:45] of the United States of America\n[01:40:47] to be investigated for not witnessing a\n[01:40:51] signature on those petitions.\n[01:40:52] >> Okay. So, there was these petitions. You\n[01:40:54] had to get 2,000 of them signed and you\n[01:40:56] had to witness them. So, you had to be\n[01:40:58] there when they were signed by people.\n[01:41:00] >> Well, that's what it says. And you're\n[01:41:02] right. It says, \"I bear witness.\" Uh, so\n[01:41:05] as I'm I left them in my clinic, my\n[01:41:07] staff signed it, the preachers in my my\n[01:41:11] clinic signed it, and those signatures\n[01:41:14] were collected while I was in the\n[01:41:15] Philippines.\n[01:41:16] >> And so you signed to witness them when\n[01:41:18] you were back from the Philippines.\n[01:41:19] >> Right. So I didn't witness them. I just\n[01:41:21] vouched that that's my sister, that's\n[01:41:24] the preacher, I know who these people\n[01:41:26] are.\n[01:41:26] >> And so they charged you for they\n[01:41:29] realized that you were in the\n[01:41:30] Philippines at the time, so you couldn't\n[01:41:31] have witnessed them based on the dates\n[01:41:32] or something. Yep.\n[01:41:33] >> And then they arrested you.\n[01:41:36] >> 12 12 felonies.\n[01:41:38] >> They give you 12 felonies\n[01:41:39] >> and 24 years in prison.\n[01:41:43] >> That's what they charged you for or\n[01:41:45] that's what\n[01:41:46] >> they charged me with 12 felonies. Six\n[01:41:48] counts for each of the six petitions.\n[01:41:50] Six. Uh so there's 12 felonies. There's\n[01:41:53] six mistakes, but each mistake counts\n[01:41:55] for two felonies. I mean, if you're\n[01:41:56] going to make a mistake, there's one\n[01:41:58] felony. When you're trying to make a\n[01:42:01] statement, there's 12 felonies\n[01:42:05] and you're the first one in the history\n[01:42:06] of the United States of America to ever\n[01:42:08] have this charge, let alone brought to\n[01:42:10] trial and then found guilty. The trial\n[01:42:15] didn't happen in my state, my town. It\n[01:42:17] happened in the state capital\n[01:42:20] where everybody knew that attorney\n[01:42:22] general. Everybody knew the opponent.\n[01:42:24] >> So they they tried to get you to serve\n[01:42:26] 24 years in prison.\n[01:42:28] >> Yeah. They sentenced me to 24 years in\n[01:42:29] prison.\n[01:42:29] >> They sentenced you to?\n[01:42:30] >> Yeah.\n[01:42:31] >> My kids are sitting behind me. I'm You\n[01:42:33] are guilty of 12 felonies and 24 years\n[01:42:36] in prison.\n[01:42:38] And then he says, \"But this stack of\n[01:42:40] papers in front of me might be the\n[01:42:42] biggest.\" He'd been a judge for 20ome\n[01:42:44] years. And I had patients who had\n[01:42:46] written in saying, \"This is the best\n[01:42:47] doctor I've ever seen.\" I didn't ask\n[01:42:49] them to write that. They just sent them\n[01:42:51] in.\n[01:42:52] >> That moment when you hear that you're\n[01:42:53] going to be in prison for 24 months, 24\n[01:42:55] years.\n[01:42:57] >> Oh god. It is the lowest moment of my\n[01:42:58] life\n[01:43:00] because I mean I do not like that the\n[01:43:04] that that story cost the state of South\n[01:43:06] Dakota any money. But I also don't like\n[01:43:09] that when you oppose\n[01:43:12] the the political giants\n[01:43:16] and you stand there with all of the\n[01:43:18] right intentions that if they need to\n[01:43:20] find something on you, they will.\n[01:43:24] six petitions and we had a thousand\n[01:43:28] extra signatures.\n[01:43:30] There was nothing. This was a nothing\n[01:43:32] for her, but it was enough. And that\n[01:43:34] attorney general said\n[01:43:37] prosecute her to the fullest extent. And\n[01:43:40] I'm not a martyr. I do things that\n[01:43:42] aren't right. And if there was a mistake\n[01:43:44] that I made, I I would take full\n[01:43:46] ownership. And to that judge, I made I\n[01:43:48] took full ownership\n[01:43:50] that the attorney general was he won.\n[01:43:55] I got sentenced.\n[01:43:57] >> But you didn't have to serve the 24\n[01:43:58] years.\n[01:43:59] >> He said, \"I'll probate that. Uh I will\n[01:44:01] suspend that with um the highest number\n[01:44:04] of service hours ever in the state of\n[01:44:06] South Dakota was 500 community service\n[01:44:08] hours serving the poorest patients in\n[01:44:11] the state.\" And when he said those\n[01:44:12] words, I thought, \"Oh my god, you don't\n[01:44:13] know who I am.\n[01:44:15] That's what I've been doing. I was\n[01:44:16] already working in Pineriidge. Well,\n[01:44:18] >> how do you how do you feel about all of\n[01:44:20] this?\n[01:44:20] >> I mean, I think of it as a test. It was\n[01:44:23] a test of I mean, most marriages aren't\n[01:44:26] going to make it through that. If you\n[01:44:28] got kids, they'll end up in rehab with\n[01:44:30] that much stress.\n[01:44:32] And I didn't want that life. I didn't\n[01:44:34] want that to be my\n[01:44:37] ending. I framed it different. I said,\n[01:44:39] \"All right, God, you're testing me.\n[01:44:42] you're testing to say, \"Can I be can I\n[01:44:44] stay true to who it is that you've\n[01:44:46] called me to be?\"\n[01:44:49] That\n[01:44:51] our marriage was incredibly uh that's a\n[01:44:54] lot of pressure. I mean, I was the\n[01:44:56] number one news story in the whole damn\n[01:44:58] state for 3 years running by a mile.\n[01:45:01] I can't go anywhere without That's her.\n[01:45:04] That's her. My parents were ashamed. My\n[01:45:07] kids would say, \"This is the woman that\n[01:45:08] takes me to Haiti. She is Mother\n[01:45:11] freaking Teresa and now she's on the\n[01:45:13] front page of a newspaper as a 12-time\n[01:45:15] felon. And your teachers at school say,\n[01:45:20] \"I read about your mom in the\n[01:45:21] newspaper.\" I mean, it's\n[01:45:25] it should have crushed me.\n[01:45:28] >> But it didn't.\n[01:45:29] >> It did not.\n[01:45:31] >> When did your life begin to turn upwards\n[01:45:33] from that point onwards? When was the\n[01:45:35] the moment where\n[01:45:37] things were\n[01:45:39] >> Well, the first thing is we appealed\n[01:45:40] that to the Supreme Court.\n[01:45:42] >> Yeah,\n[01:45:42] >> that's where the big legal bills come\n[01:45:44] from.\n[01:45:44] >> I mean, you're fighting an attorney\n[01:45:45] general. That's where And the Supreme\n[01:45:48] Court said that that attorney general\n[01:45:49] abused his power for at least six of\n[01:45:52] them. And then that judge said, \"I'll\n[01:45:55] erase all these because of the work\n[01:45:56] you've done.\" So, the 12 felonies went\n[01:45:58] away during\n[01:45:59] >> all of them.\n[01:46:00] >> All of them.\n[01:46:01] I think on the edge of that story, um I\n[01:46:04] work to resurrect people's health back\n[01:46:06] to a place where they they get their\n[01:46:09] best life. And yes, ketones are a really\n[01:46:11] big part of that.\n[01:46:13] But as you look at the relationships\n[01:46:16] you've got around your life, take the\n[01:46:18] core ones and nurture them to a place\n[01:46:20] where uh your best life comes out of\n[01:46:23] those relationships. find that purpose\n[01:46:26] that you've been designed for and take\n[01:46:29] those relationship with you as you seek\n[01:46:31] that. I I know that's what happened to\n[01:46:34] me. I cared about the ones on the inner\n[01:46:36] circle and I had a one track of this is\n[01:46:38] what I'm designed to do.\n[01:46:41] We have a closing tradition where the\n[01:46:43] last guest leaves a question for the\n[01:46:44] next and the question left for you is do\n[01:46:46] you have a daily practice to find deep\n[01:46:49] inner peace when you are emotionally\n[01:46:52] triggered and if so please share it with\n[01:46:55] the audience.\n[01:46:58] Yeah, I have a a devotion that I do\n[01:47:00] every morning that um that centers me,\n[01:47:04] keeps me in line with my faith.\n[01:47:08] And it's not that you do it on the bad\n[01:47:10] days, it's that you've got the\n[01:47:12] foundation for doing it on the good\n[01:47:13] days. And there are generations\n[01:47:18] a daily devotion [clears throat] like\n[01:47:19] upper room is a is a spiritual devotion\n[01:47:22] for my church.\n[01:47:24] >> What What does that look like? Is it a\n[01:47:25] prayer or\n[01:47:26] >> Yeah, it's a prayer. And\n[01:47:27] >> And how does that sound? What is\n[01:47:29] >> Yeah, the it's usually a scripture and\n[01:47:31] then it's a prayer that has been paired\n[01:47:34] with that scripture. And again, it's\n[01:47:36] easy to not do it routinely. But when\n[01:47:39] you practice it on the good days, it's\n[01:47:41] what lifts you on those really tough\n[01:47:43] days.\n[01:47:45] And sometimes you forget you're not the\n[01:47:46] first person to run through these\n[01:47:47] problems.\n[01:47:49] But there are thousands of generations\n[01:47:52] that have taught you how to do life and\n[01:47:55] get through those hard places and I'm\n[01:47:58] going to use their rules.\n[01:48:00] I'm going to follow what that scripture\n[01:48:03] says\n[01:48:05] and lead for my best life.\n[01:48:07] >> Dr. Boss, thank you.\n[01:48:09] >> Very good.\n[01:48:09] >> We are done. I really think I really\n[01:48:11] appreciate so much about you. I\n[01:48:13] appreciate your personality. Well, I\n[01:48:15] >> incredibly engaging, but I also just um\n[01:48:17] I appreciate that you've taken the time\n[01:48:18] to make so much content over on your\n[01:48:21] YouTube channel, which I'm going to link\n[01:48:22] on screen and below now, um to sort of\n[01:48:25] demystify and break down some of these\n[01:48:27] really complicated subjects that people\n[01:48:29] struggle with, and they're looking for\n[01:48:30] someone who they can trust, who has a\n[01:48:32] bit of personality, um who can\n[01:48:35] communicate some of these very\n[01:48:36] complicated things to them. And on your\n[01:48:37] channel, you talk about everything from\n[01:48:39] the ketogenic diet to many of the things\n[01:48:41] we talked about today to the creatine\n[01:48:42] stuff to cancer more broadly, this idea\n[01:48:46] of autophagy and fasting, um, and lots\n[01:48:49] of other things. I mean, everything\n[01:48:50] we've talked about today and much, much\n[01:48:51] much more. So, I highly recommend people\n[01:48:53] go and check your channel out if they\n[01:48:54] would like to learn more, it will be\n[01:48:56] linked below. And, [snorts] um, you've\n[01:48:58] written some wonderful books. Um, some\n[01:49:01] of them that we've referenced, we've got\n[01:49:02] the Keto Continuum, which I'm going to\n[01:49:03] link below as well. um this wonderful\n[01:49:05] book called Any Way You Can, a\n[01:49:07] beginner's guide to ketones for life,\n[01:49:09] which um talks a lot about Rose and has\n[01:49:11] some wonderful photos of Rose in that\n[01:49:14] book. And we have the keto continuum\n[01:49:16] workbook, which is a much more practical\n[01:49:18] um\n[01:49:18] >> yeah, it goes hand inhand with the other\n[01:49:20] one and it's what I give my patients in\n[01:49:23] the clinic is they got to go through\n[01:49:24] that workbook.\n[01:49:24] >> I think a lot of people are looking for\n[01:49:26] exactly that. They're looking for\n[01:49:27] something that they can follow step by\n[01:49:29] step which gives them a framework for\n[01:49:30] progress and I guess in in a way holds\n[01:49:32] them accountable which is exactly what\n[01:49:33] the workbook does. Thank you so much.\n[01:49:35] You're you're helping millions of\n[01:49:37] people. You've had a rough ride\n[01:49:38] if I'm being like 12 felonies in 24\n[01:49:40] years in prisoners for for something as\n[01:49:42] as little as what you did I think is is\n[01:49:45] bizarre quite frankly. But you know it's\n[01:49:48] a story of inspiration that it didn't\n[01:49:49] hold you back and you've risen like a\n[01:49:51] phoenix and created so much incredible\n[01:49:53] work therefore that's benefited so many.\n[01:49:54] So, please do keep going.\n[01:49:56] >> God bless you. Thanks for having me\n[01:49:57] here. I'm really excited to be on your\n[01:49:58] show.\n[01:49:59] >> Thank you so much, Dr. Buzz. [music]\n[01:50:04] >> This is something that I've made for\n[01:50:05] you. I realized that the direio audience\n[01:50:08] are strivvers. Whether it's in business\n[01:50:09] or health, we all have big goals that we\n[01:50:11] want to accomplish. And one of the\n[01:50:13] things I've learned is that when you aim\n[01:50:15] at the big big big goal, it can feel\n[01:50:18] incredibly psychologically uncomfortable\n[01:50:21] because it's kind of like being stood at\n[01:50:22] the foot of Mount Everest and looking\n[01:50:24] upwards. The way to accomplish your\n[01:50:26] goals is by breaking them down into tiny\n[01:50:28] small steps. And we call this in our\n[01:50:30] team the 1%. And actually this\n[01:50:32] philosophy is highly responsible for\n[01:50:34] much of our success here. So what we've\n[01:50:37] done so that you at home can accomplish\n[01:50:39] any big goal that you have is we've made\n[01:50:41] these 1% diaries and we released these\n[01:50:44] last year and they all sold out. So I\n[01:50:46] asked my team over and over again to\n[01:50:48] bring the diaries back but also to\n[01:50:49] introduce some new colors and to make\n[01:50:51] some minor tweaks to the diary. So now\n[01:50:53] we have a better range for you. So, if\n[01:50:57] you have a big goal in mind and you need\n[01:50:59] a framework and a process and some\n[01:51:01] motivation, then I highly recommend you\n[01:51:03] get one of these diaries before they all\n[01:51:05] sell out once again. And you can get\n[01:51:07] yours now at the diary.com where you can\n[01:51:09] get 20% off our Black Friday bundle. And\n[01:51:12] if you want the link, the link is in the\n[01:51:13] description below.\n[01:51:15] [music]\n[01:51:22] [music]\n[01:51:25] Heat. Heat.
