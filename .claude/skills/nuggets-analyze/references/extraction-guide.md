# Extraction Guide

## Segmentation Principles

1. **Topic-based**: Each segment covers ONE main topic/discussion
2. **Natural breaks**: Look for topic transitions, new questions, subject changes
3. **Reasonable length**: 2-20 minutes per segment typically
4. **Speaker shifts**: Major guest monologues often form natural segments
